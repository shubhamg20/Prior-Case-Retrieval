Every dealer whose gross turnover exceeds the taxable quantum is liable to pay tax on sales effected by him after a specified date and while he is liable to pay tax he cannot carry on business unless he gets himself registered and possesses a registration certificate One group consists of appeals where the assessees purchased goods of the class specified in the certificate of registration as being intended for resale by them and furnished to the dealers selling the goods declarations in the prescribed form stating that the goods were intended for resale kind thereafter resold the goods though not within the territory of Delhi The second group consists of appeals where the assessees Purchased goods of the class specified in the certificate of registration as being intended for use by there There are no words such as inside the <ORG> territory of Delhi qualifying resale so as to limit it to resale within the territory of Delhi It is obvious that resale is subsequent sale after the first and it must therefore have the some meaning as sale defined in Thus there is no tax sought to be imposed on the resale under section a ii or the second proviso and the argument of lack of legislative competence has no substance It would be straining the language of the enactment too much to say that the words by him are intended to mean by him as a registered dealer It is now well settled that when the <ORG> is construing a statutory enactment the intention of the <ORG> should be gathered from the language used by it and it is not permissible to the court to speculate about the Legislative intent Section a ii and the second proviso occur in a taxing statute and it is a well settled rule of interpretation that in construing a taxing statute one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the Statute or the substance of the law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> These appeals raise a short but interesting question of law relating to the interpretation of section a ii of the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act as applied to the Union Territory of Delhi hereinafter for the sake of convenience referred to as Delhi The Act was extended to Delhi subject to certain modifications by a Notification dated th April issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Part States Laws Act and it came into force in Delhi on th May by virtue of a Notification issued under section sub section of the Act There have been several amendments made in the Act from time to time since the date of its application to Delhi but we are concerned in these appeals only with the assessment periods and and hence we shall confine ourselves to the relevant provisions of the Act as they stood during these assessment periods Section enacted the definition provision and clause of that section defined a dealer to mean any person who carries on the business of selling goods in Delhi There was an explanation to this clause which laid down as to when a sale or purchase shall be deemed to take place inside Delhi Section sub section provided that every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded the taxable quantum at any time within such year shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on all sales effected after the date notified by the Chief Commissioner and sub section of that section said that every dealer to whom sub section does not apply shall if his gross turnover calculated from the commencement of any year exceeds the taxable quantum at any time within such year be liable to pay tax under the Act on the expiry of two months from the date on which such gross turnover first exceeds the taxable quantum on all sales effected after such expiry Sub section of section defined taxable quantum to mean in relation to any dealer who imports for sale any goods into Delhi or manufactures or produces any goods for sale regardless of the value of the goods imported manufactured or produced ten thousand rupees and in relation to any other dealer thirty thousand rupees Sub section of section provided different rates of tax according as the goods fell within one category or another at which the tax payable by a dealer shall be levied on his taxable turnover What is taxable turnover was defined in subsection of section to mean that part of a dealer gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting therefrom a his turnover during that period on i the sale of goods declared tax free tinder section ii sales to a registered dealer of goods of the class or classes specified in the certificate of registration of such dealer as being intended for resale by him or for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale and of containers or other materials for the packing of goods of the class or classes so specified for sale Provided that in the case of such sales a declaration duly filled up and signed by the registered dealer to whom the goods are sold and containing the prescribed particulars on a prescribed from obtainable from the prescribed authority is furnished in the prescribed manner by the dealer who sells the goods iii Sales to a registered dealer engaged in the business of raising coal of any goods which are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to be required directly for use in connection with the raising of coal iv sales to any undertaking supplying electrical energy to the public under a licence or sanction granted or deemed to have been granted under the Indian Electricity Act IX of of goods for use by it in the generations distribution of such energy Sales of goods which are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been dispatched by or on behalf of dealer to an address outside the Union Territory of Delhi vi such other sales as may be prescribed This was the definition until th May when by Finance Act the main enactment in section a ii was substituted by the following provision In this Act the expression taxable turnover means that part of a dealer gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting therefrom a his turnover during that period on i ii sales to a registered dealer of goods of the class or classes specified in the certificate of registration of such dealer as being intended for re sale by him or for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture in the Union Territory of Delhi hereinafter in this subclause referred to as Delhi of goods other than goods declared tax free under section A for sale inside Delhi or for sale in the course of inter State trade or commerce being a sale occasioning or effected by transfer of documents of title to such goods during the movement of such goods from Delhi or for sale in the course of export outside India being a sale occasioning the movement of such goods from Delhi or a sale effected by transfer of documents of title to such goods effected during the movement of such goods from Delhi to a place outside India and after the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India and of containers or other materials for the packing of goods of the class or classes so specified for sale Section sub section laid down that no dealer shall while being liable to pay tax under section carry on business as a dealer unless he has been registered and possesses a registration certificate and subsection of that section provided for grant of a certificate of regis tration to a dealer on an application being made by him under subsection and said that such certificate of registration shall specify the class or classes of goods for the purposes of sub clause ii it clause a of sub section of section Section conferred power on the Chief Commissioner to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act and in exercise of this power the Delhi Sales Tax Rules were made by the Chief Commissioner This was in conformity with the requirement of section a ii as it stood prior to its amendment and though section a ii was substituted by the Finance Act of no amendment was made in the form of the certificate of registration and it was only on th March that clause of the form of the certificate of registration was substituted so as to declare that the sales of the specified goods to the dealer will be free of tax when they are for use as raw materials in the manufacture in the Union territory of Delhi of goods for sale in the manner specified in section a ii or for resale and are duly covered by me our registration certificate No valid from and are required by me us for sci re sale for use as raw material in the manufacture in Delhi in accordance with the provisions contained in section a ii of the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act as in force Dealer The Act as originally enacted ended with Section but by Amending Act of Section was introduced in the Act with effect from st October and this section provided that nothing in the Act or under the rules shall be deemed to impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on any sale or purchase of any goods if such sale or purchase takes place i in the course of Inter state trade or commerce ii outside the Union territory of Delhi or iii in the course One group consists of appeals where the assessees purchased goods of the class specified in the certificate of registration as being intended for resale by them and furnished to the dealers selling the goods declarations in the prescribed form as it stood prior to th March stating that the goods were intended for resale and thereafter resold the goods though not within the territory of Delhi while the other consists of appeals where the assessees purchased goods of the class specified in the certificate of registration as being intended for use by them as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale and furnished to the dealers selling the goods declarations in the prescribed form as it stood prior to th March stating that the goods were purchased by them for use as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale and thereafter used the goods purchased as law materials in the manufacture of goods in some cases outside Delhi and in some others inside but in the latter sold the goods so manufactured outside Delhi The view taken in the orders impugned in the appeals and accepted by <ORG> in <ORG> case was that for the purpose of section a ii and the Second Proviso resale of the goods purchased was confined to resale inside Delhi and so also use of the goods purchased as raw materials in the manufacture of goods and sale of manufactured goods were required to be inside Delhi and therefore if the assessees resold the The question which arises for determination in the appeals is whether this view taken by <ORG> and approved by <ORG> in <ORG> case is correct and can be sustained Every dealer whose gross turnover exceeds the taxable quantum is liable to pay tax on sales effected by him after a specified date and while he is liable to pay tax he cannot carry on business unless he gets himself registered and possesses a registration certificate Such declaration given by the purchasing dealer to the dealer selling the goods would afford evidence that the goods were purchased by the purchasing dealer as being intended for resale by him or for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale But what would be the position if the purchasing dealer does not act according to the intention expressed by him in the declaration given to the selling dealer and in the one case does not resell the goods and in the other does not use them as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale But if the goods are utilised by the purchasing dealer for some other purpose contrary to the intention expressed by him in the declaration the object and purpose of giving deduction to the selling dealer would be defeated Where the purchasing dealer gives a declaration of intention to resell the goods purchased or to use them as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale he must act in accordance with that intention because it is on the basis of that intention that deduction is allowed to the selling dealer and if he does not carry out that intention and utilises the goods for any other purpose it stands to reason that the tax which is lost to the <ORG> by reason of deduction granted to the selling dealer should be recoverable from him that is the purchasing dealer The Second Proviso is thus intended to provide the consequence of the purchasing dealer not complying with the statement of intention expressed in the declaration given by him to the selling dealer under the First Proviso Now the first question that arises for consideration is whether resale in section a ii and the Second Proviso means resale any where without any geographical limitation or it is confined only to resale inside Delhi Secondly it was urged that the <ORG> had no legislative competence to tax sale outside Delhi and moreover by reason of section sale outside Delhi was taken out of the purview of the Act and resale within the meaning of section a ii and the Second Proviso could not therefore possibly include resale outside Delhi We do not think there is any substance or validity in these arguments and we see no cogent or compelling reasons to add the words inside the Union Territory of Delhi to qualify resale in section a ii and the Second Proviso Now if there is one principle of interpretation more well settled than any other it is that a statutory enactment must ordinarily be construed according to the plain natural meaning of its languageand that no words should be added altered or modified unless it is plainly necessary to do so in order to prevent a provision from beingunintelligible absurd unreasonable unworkable or total irreconcilable with the rest of the statute This rule of literal construction is firmly established and it has received judicial recognition in numerous cases Lord <NAME> applied the rule in <NAME> Dakes to construe and as or in section of the Official Secrets Act and stated It seems to this Court that where the literal reading of a statute and a penal statute produces an intelligible result clearly there is no ground for reading in words or changing words according to what may be the supposed intention of <ORG> Lord <NAME> also with great clarity and precision which always characterise his judgments enunciated the rule as follows in <ORG> <ORG> Cases where it has properly been held that a word can be struck out of a deed or statute and another substituted can as far as I am aware be grouped under three heads where without such substitution the provision is unintelligible or absurd or totally unreasonable where it is unworkable and where it is totally irreconcilable with the plain intention shown by the rest of the deed or statute There are no words such as inside the Union Territory of Delhi qualifying resale so as to limit it to resale within the territory of Delhi The argument urged on behalf of the <ORG> requires us to readsuch limitative words in section a ii and the Second Proviso The question is whether there is any necessity or justification for doing so If resale is construed as not confined to the territory of Delhi but it may take place any where does section a ii or the Second Proviso lead to a result manifestly unintelligible absurd unreasonable unworkable or irreconcilable with the rest of the Act Is there any compulsive necessity to depart from the rule of plain and natural construction and read words of limitation in section a ii and the Second Proviso when such words have been omitted by the law giver We do not think so The <ORG> was enacting a piece of legislation intended to levy tax on dealers who are laymen and we have no doubt that if the legislative intent was that resale should be within the territory of Delhi and not outside the It is a well settled rule of interpretation that where there are two expressions which might have been used to convey a certain intention but one of those expressions will convey that intention more clearly than the other it is proper to conclude that if the legislature used that one of the two expressions which would convey the intention less clearly it does not intend to convey that intention at all It is true that the <ORG> had no legislative competence to tax sale outside the territory of Delhi and section also in clear and explicit terms exempts sale outside the territory of Delhi from liability to tax under the Act but we fail to see how this circumstance can require us to construe resale in section a ii and the Second Proviso as excluding resale outside the territory of Delhi It is obvious that resale is subsequent sale after the first and it must therefore have the same meaning as sale defined in section It is still the first sale made by the selling dealer which is taxed and not the resale made by the purchasing dealer Thus there is no tax sought to be imposed on the resale under section a ii or the Second Proviso but resale is made a condition of granting deduction in respect of the first sale The <ORG> placed some reliance on the words by him following upon resale in section a ii and the Second Proviso for the purpose of contending that the resale contemplated there is resale by the purchasing dealer as a registered dealer and since a registered dealer is a dealer who carries on business in Delhi and whose liability to tax is determined by reference to his gross turnover in Delhi resale by him must be resale within the territory of Delhi But this contention has no merit and the utmost that can be said about it is that it raises a point that has position but no magnitude It is clear from the scheme of the Act that a dealer who carries on business of selling goods in the territory of Delhi and who is liable to pay tax under section of the Act is required to be registered and he must possess a registration certificate It would be straining the language of the enactment too much to say that the words by him are intended to mean by him as a registered dealer Moreover it may be noted that though a registered dealer has to be a person who carries on business of selling goods in the territory of Delhi there is no requirement of law that a registered dealer must effect sales only in Delhi and not outside There is nothing in the Act which prohibits a registered dealer from selling goods outside Delhi It is now well settled that when the court is construing a statutory enactment the intention of the <ORG> should be gathered from the language used by it and it is not permissible to the court to speculate about the legislative intent If the language of a statute is clear and explicit effect must be given to it for in such a case the words best declare the intention of the law giver Here the language employed in section a ii and the Second Proviso is capable of bearing one and only one meaning and there is nothing in the Act to show that the legislature exempted the sale to the purchasing dealer from tax on the hypothesis that the Union Territory of Delhi would be entitled to tax the resale by the purchasing dealer We do not find evidence of such legislative intent in any provision of the Act On the contrary it is very clear that there are certain categories of resales by the purchasing dealer which are admittedly free from tax The Second Proviso too does not support any such legislative intent for in the event there contemplated namely where the purchasing dealer utilises the goods for any purpose other than resale what is taxed in the hands of the purchasing dealer is not the resale by him but the sale to him and that is done not with a view to ensuring that the goods must suffer tax at least at one point but because the purchasing dealer having committed a breach of the intention expressed by him in the declaration on the basis of which exemption is granted to the selling dealer he should not be allowed to profit from his own wrong and to escape the amount of tax on the sale We do not in the circumstances see any cogent or compelling reason for reading the words inside the Union Territory of Delhi after resale in section a ii and the Second Proviso It must also be remembered that section a ii and the Second Proviso occur in a taxing statute and it is a well settled rule of interpretation that in construing a taxing statute one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax One can only look fairly at the language used Even if there is any doubt as to interpretation it must be resolved in favour of the subject We would therefore be extremely loathe to add in section a ii and the Second Proviso words which are not there and which if added would have the effect of imposing tax liability on the purchasing dealer It may also be pointed out that the Act in the present case was originally enacted by <ORG> in and it was The Act was thus in operation prior to th August in Bengal and thereafter in West Bengal for an aggregate period of about ten years before it was made applicable to Delhi It was not disputed on behalf of the <ORG> that during this period the Department administered the provision of section a ii on the basis that resale was not confined to resale inside the State of Bengal or West Bengal as the case may be but it also included outside State resale Then again it was common ground that at least for a few years after the Act was made applicable to the territory of Delhi the <ORG> interpreted resale in section a ii to mean resale any where and not necessarily inside the territory of Delhi and administered the law on the basis of such interpretation The circumstance that for long years the <ORG> did not intervene to amend the law by adding the words inside the Union Territory of Delhi in section a ii even though the <ORG> was continually administering the law on the basis that resale in section a ii means resale any where and not necessarily inside the territory of Delhi and acquiescence in this interpretation placed by the <ORG> is a circumstance which does throw some little light on the intention of the <ORG> and indicates that the <ORG> did not intend to restrict resale to the territory of Delhi There are no words like inside the Union Territory of Delhi to qualify manufacture or sale and there is no cogent or compelling reason for reading such words in section a ii and the Second Proviso The only end use of the goods purchased required to be made for attracting the applicability of section a ii is that the goods must be utilised by the purchasing dealer as raw materials in the manufacture of goods and the goods so manufactured must be sold irrespective whether the manufacture or sale takes place inside Delhi or outside If the purchasing dealer does not use the goods purchased as raw materials in the manufacture of goods or having manufactured the goods does not sell them he would commit a breach of the intention expressed by him in the declaration furnished to the selling dealer and the Second Proviso would immediately be attracted and the price of the goods purchased by him would be liable to be included in his taxable turnover But so long as he carries out the intention expressed in the declaration and uses the goods purchased as raw materials in the manufacture of goods whether inside or outside Delhi and sells the goods so manufactured in Delhi or outside he would not tall within the Second Proviso and the sale to him would not be taxable in his hands It is therefore made clear that sales of raw materials will be tax free only when such sales are made by those who manufacture in Delhi taxable goods for sale It is of course true that a parlia mentary assumption may be unfounded and an amendment may proceed on an erroneous construction of the statute and therefore it cannot alter the correct interpretation to be placed upon the statute but if there is any ambiguity in the statute the subsequent amendment can certainly be relied upon for fixing the proper interpretation which is to be put upon the statute prior to the amendment The amendment made in section a ii read with the statement of objects and reasons thus clearly supports the construction that under the unamended section manufacture as well as sale could be any where and not necessarily inside the territory of Delhi We must therefore reach the conclusion that during the relevant assessment years resale within the meaning of section a ii and the Second Proviso was not confined to the territory of Delhi but also included resale outside the territory of Delhi and similarly for the period upto th May when section a ii was amended by Finance Act manufacture and sale contemplated by the section were not restricted to the territory of Delhi but could also be outside There was no geographical limitation confining resale manufacture or sale to the territory of Delhi Now the burden of proving that the goods purchased were utilised by the purchasing dealer for a different purpose would be on the <ORG> if the <ORG> wants to include the price of the goods purchased in the taxable turnover of the purchasing dealer and it would therefore be for the <ORG> to show in a given case that the goods purchased were utilised by the purchasing dealer for a different purpose that is where he purchased the goods for resale he did not resell them and where he purchased the goods for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale he either did not use them as raw materials in the manufacturer of goods or even if he did so the goods manufactured were not sold by him This intention of the assessees was evidenced by the declarations given by them to the selling dealers at the time of purchase of the goods On the view taken by us it was immaterial where the assessees who purchased goods for resale resold them inside Delhi or outside in either case the Second Proviso would not be applicable and the assessees would not be liable to be taxed on the price of the goods purchased by them upto th May it did not make any difference whether the assessees in those cases where they purchased goods for use as raw materails in the manufacture of goods for sale used them as raw materials inside Delhi or out side or having manufactured the goods sold them inside or outside Delhi for in either case the Second Proviso would not be attracted and the price of the goods purchased by them would not be includable in their taxable turnover The burden of showing that the assessese utilised the goods purchased for any other purpose that is for a purpose different from that for which the goods were purchased as evidenced by the declaration would be on the <ORG> and the <ORG> may discharge this burden by calling upon the assessees to produce evidence to show in one case that the goods were resold by them and in the other that the goods were used by them as raw material in the manufacture of goods and the goods so manufactured were sold We have already pointed out that on th May section a ii was amended by Finance Act and the words in the Union Territory of Delhi were added after the word manufacture and the words inside Delhi after the word sale But the form of the declaration to be given by the purchasing dealer to the selling dealer as prescribed in Rule was not amended until th March with a view to bringing it in conformity with the amended section a ii The result was that from th May to th March the form of the declaration continued to be the same as before and carried the statement that the goods were purchased by the purchasing dealer for use by him as raw matinal in the manufacture of goods for sale without any restriction as to place of manufacture or sale and this was the form in which declarations were given by the assessees to the selling dealers when they purchased the goods Now if the declarations given by the assessees stated the purpose of purchase of goods to be used as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale and did not specify that the manufacture and sale will be inside the territory of Delhi it is difficult to see how the assessees could be said to have utilised the goods for any other purpose if they used the goods as raw materials in manufacture outside Delhi or sale the goods manufactured outside Delhi Even if they manufactured goods outside Delhi and sold the goods so manufactured outside Delhi the use by them of the goods purchased would be for the purpose stated in the declarations and it would not be right to say that they utilised the goods for any other purpose Even if we take the view that by reason of the amendment of section a ii the form of the declaration also stood amended though in fact no amendment was made in it until th March it would not help the <ORG> because in that case the declarations given by the assessees to the selling dealers could not be said to be on the prescribed form and in terms of section a ii and the consequence of that would be that the selling dealers would be disentitled to exemption under section a ii and not that the price of the goods purchased would be includable in the taxable turnover of the assessees Exemption would be available to the selling dealers under section a ii only if they could show that they have obtained proper declarations from the assessees and consequently if the declarations are not on the prescribed form or in terms of section a ii on the assumption that they are required to be in conformity with that provision it is the selling dealers who would be ineligible for exemption and there would be no question of the assessees being made liable to tax under the Second Proviso It Is indeed difficult to see how the assessees could be saddled with liability to tax under the Second Proviso when they have literally complied with the statement of intention expressed in the declarations given by them to the selling dealers However it was amended by Punjab Act No of by the addition of the words in the State of Punjab after the word manufacture and the amended section applied during the relevant assessment year The result was that not only was section a ii amended to make it clear that the manufacture must be in the State of Punjab but also Rule and the form of declaration were also amended so as to provide that the declaration must set but the intention of the purchasing dealer to use the goods purchased in the manufacture in the State of Punjab of goods for sale The appellants gave declarations in the amended form with the word in the State of Punjab after the word manufacture against purchases of raw cotton made by them and they ginned the cotton in their ginning mills and sent the bales to their spinning and weaving mills situated in the State of Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of manufacture of cloth The principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellants for repelling the applicability of the Second Proviso was that since the certificate of registration held by them was not amended by the addition of the words in the State of Punjab and there was no condition in it that the goods must be purchased for use in the manufacture in the State of Punjab of goods for sale they were not bound to use the cotton purchased in the manufacture of cloth in the State of Punjab and even if they did so outside the State of Punjab the Second Proviso was not attracted It would be seen that the only question before the <ORG> was as to what was the effect of absence of the words in the State of Punjab in the certificate of registration in a case where Rule and Form XXII were both simultaneously amended along with section a ii and the declaration on given by the purchasing dealer contained the words in the State of Punjab after the word manufacture so that there was a breach of the statement contained in the declaration when the purchasing dealer used the goods purchased in manufacture outside the State of Punjab The <ORG> was not concerned with a case where Rule and Form XXIII continued to stand unamended and the declaration given by the purchasing dealer did not state that the use of the goods purchased in manufacture would be in the State of Punjab but merely contained a general statement that the goods purchased would be used in the manufacture of goods for sale and the purchasing dealer utilised the goods purchased in manufacture outside the State of Punjab without committing a breach of the statement in the declaration That is the case before us and it is entirely different from the case decided by the <ORG> in <ORG> case supra which does not contain a statement that the manufacture of goods would be in Delhi or the manufactured goods would be sold in Delhi this condition should be read into the declaration by the addition of some such words as inside Delhi after manufacture and sale so that if the goods purchased are not used as raw materials in manufacture in Delhi or the goods manufactured are sold outside Delhi the purchasing dealer could be said to have committed a breach of the statement made in the declaration so as to attract the applicability of the Second Proviso We may refer to one other contention advanced on behalf of the appellants in Civil Appeals Nos and of and and of The contention was that what the Second Proviso sought to do in effect and substance was to tax purchases made by the purchasing dealer by including the price of the goods purchased in his taxable turnover but this was impermissible because section was the only charging section in the Act and under that section tax was payable only on sales effected by a dealer and purchases effected by him could not be taxed We asked the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in these appeals as to what was the sequester of this contention and whether it was her submission that the Second proviso was void as being outside the legislative competence of the <ORG> She however urged that in her submission the Second Proviso was inconsistent with section and therefore no effect should be given to it It may be pointed out that even if there were some conflict which we do not think there is it would have to be reconciled by a harmonious reading of the two sections and it would not be right to adopt a construction which tenders one of the two sections meaningless and ineffectual unless the conflict between the two is so utterly irreconcilable that the <ORG> is driven to that conclusion Here we find that section merely imposes liability on a dealer to pay tax if his gross turnover exceeds the taxable quantum It is really section which provides for levy of tax and it says that the tax payable by a dealer shall be levied on his taxable turnover We do not therefore see any inconsistency at all between section and the Second Proviso and the contention urged on behalf of the appellants in these appeals must be rejected There were several grounds on which the imposition of this penalty was challenged on behalf of the assessees but it is not necessary to refer to all of them since there is one ground which is in our opinion sufficient to invalidate the order imposing the penalty We have already pointed out that even where the assessees used the goods purchased as raw materials in the manufacture of goods outside Delhi or having manufactured the goods sold them outside Delhi there was no breach of the intention expressed by them in the declarations given to the selling dealers and they could not be said to have utilised the goods for any purpose other than that for which they were purchased so as to attract the applicability of the Second Proviso But of this there was no evidence at all before the assessing authority and the order imposing penalty was therefore plainly unjustified We accordingly allow the appeals and the writ petitions set aside the orders passed by the High <ORG> in Civil Appeals Nos of and of as also the orders passed by the assessing authority which are impugned in the appeals and the writ petitions and direct the assessing authority whose orders are set aside to pass fresh orders in each case in the light of the above decision given by us We also set aside the order passed by the assessing authority imposing penalty of Rs The respondent will pay the costs of the appellants petitioners in each appeal and writ petition
