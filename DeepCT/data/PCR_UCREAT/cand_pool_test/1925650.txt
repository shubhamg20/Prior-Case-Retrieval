HEADNOTE The respondent filed a petition under of the Representation of the People Act challenging the election of the appellants to <ORG> on the ground that they had committed corrupt practices the material allegations being that the appellants could in the furtherance of their election enlist the support of certain Government servants and that the appellant No had employed two persons in excess of the prescribed number for his election purposes It was contended on behalf of the appellants that <ORG> had no power either under Of the Act or under The word trial in of the Act is used in a wide sense as including the entire proceedings before the <ORG> from the time when the petition is transferred to it under of the Act till the pronouncement of its award There is no antithesis between procedure in and powers in of the Act and Where an application would lie to the <ORG> under it would have the power to pass the necessary order on it Held further that the amendment introduced a new charge altered the character of the petition and was beyond the powers of the <ORG> and necessary evidence had not been adduced to support a finding as to the additional employment and no corrupt practices either under cl or Of I had therefore been committed In deciding the question as to whether any person in addition to the number permitted by the Act had been employed by a candidate for his election purposes the well established distinction between a contract for services and a contract of service must be borne in mind and in absence of any evidence to show that the contract with the person engaged was one of service that he was to do the Work personally with or without the assistance of others lie could not be held to have been employed in law On June the respondent herein filed a petition under of the Act alleging that the appellants had committed a number of corrupt practices and prayed that the election might be declared wholly void There was no list of particulars attached to the petition as provided in of the Act On December the first appellant filed his written statement and therein he stated with reference to para that it was wrong and denied that the answering respondent in furtherance of his election enlisted the support of any government servant Respondent No who was a defeated candidate and supported the respondent herein filed a written statement on December wherein he alleged that the appellants had obtained services of village officers such as Lambardars and Sarpanches in furtherance of their election prospects Respondent No who was another defeated candidate also filed a written statement on the same day adopting the allegations in the statement of the fourth respondent adding <NAME> to the list of village officials whose assistance was procured by the Appellants On January the appellants filed a written statement objecting to the reception of the replication on the ground that the petitioner respondent had no right to file it and that it was a mere device to add to the original petition They also filed an application on the same date for a preliminary hearing of certain issues relating to the contentions raised by them in their written statements that the allegations in the petition were vague and should be struck off for want of particulars and the same was posted for hearing on February Meantime after the preliminary argument aforesaid had commenced and before it was concluded the respondent filed on February an application for amendment of his petition the order on which is the main target of attack in this appeal This application was opposed by the appellants on the ground that the amendment did not fall within that the matters sought to be introduced thereby were new charges and if admitted they would alter the very character of the petition and that it should not be granted as a fresh petition on those allegations would be barred on that date It should be mentioned that oh January respondent No had filed an application to raise additional issues on his averments that the appellants had obtained assistance from the village officers That application was also contested by the appellants On November the <ORG> by a majority passed an order dismissing the application of the fourth respondent for additional issues They also contend that even if the <ORG> had the power to order Amendment the order in question is not justified on the merits and is erroneous It is necessary to set out the statutory provisions bearing on the question An election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more grounds specified in sub ss The <ORG> shall have the powers which are vested in a court under the Code of Civil Procedure Act of when trying a suit in respect of the following matters a discovery and inspection enforcing the attendance of witnesses and requiring the depositor their expenses competing the production of documents examining witnesses on oath granting adjournments reception of evidence taken on affidavit and issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses and may summon and examine suo motu any person whose evidence appears to it to be material and shall be deemed to be a civil court within the meaning of ss and of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of Now we start with this that grants a power to the <ORG> to amend particulars in a list What is its scope Is it open to the <ORG> acting under this provision to direct new instances of the corrupt practices to be added to the list And if it is is that what it did in the present case It is contended by the learned Solicitor General on behalf of the appellants that does not authorize the inclusion of new instances of corrupt practices and that all that could be ordered under that provision was giving of fuller particulars in respect of instances given in the petition Then enacts that when there is an allegation of corrupt or illegal practice particulars thereof should be given in a separate list The result is that the power under a to allow further and better particulars will include a power to allow fresh instances of the charges which form the grounds on which the election is Questioned The true scope of these Provisions came up for consideration in <NAME> <NAME> The respondent took out an application for an order that the petition be taken off the file on the ground that it merely stated the grounds but not the facts constituting the particulars as required by Rule In rejecting the former prayer <NAME> observed Now with regard to the form of the petition it seems to me that it sufficiently follows the spirit and intention of the rules and no injustice can be done by its generality because ample provision is made by the rules to prevent the respondent being surprised or deprived of an opportunity of a fair trial by an order for such particulars as the judge may deem reasonable There is it should be observed nothing in the Election law of England corresponding to the question of particulars being left there to be dealt with under the Rules applicable to the trial of causes The consequence is that while under the English practice the petitioners are not obliged to state particulars of corrupt practices in their petition under a statement of those particulars must be made in the petition in a separate list annexed thereto And even when there is no list filed as in the present case it would be competent to the <ORG> to allow an amendment giving for the first time instances of corrupt practice provided such corrupt practice has been made a ground of attack in the petition it is accordingly contended that the power to allow further and better particulars can be exercised only in respect of particulars already furnished whether they be contained in the body of the petition or in the list and that therefore an order permitting inclusion of new instances is outside the purview of We see no reason why we should put this narrow construction on the word matter Before dealing with this question it will be convenient to consider the alternative contention raised for the respondent that even if the <ORG> had no power to order the amendment in question under of the Act it was competent to do so under VI Civil Procedure Code and that this <ORG> should not in special appeal interfere with the discretion exercised by it in making the order That raises the question which has been very much debated both in the Election <ORG>s and in the High <ORG>s of the States as to whether Now in A <NAME> it was stated by Lord <NAME> that the word practice and it means as observed in <NAME> Mixors the same thing as procedure denotes the rules that make or guide the Curcus cirise and regulate the proceedings ina cause within the walls or limits of the <ORG> itself And these proceedings include all steps which might be taken in the prosecution or defence thereof including an application for amendment But it is contended for the appellants that VI cannot be held to apply to proceedings before the <ORG> by reason of because under that section it is only the trial of the election petition that has to be in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and the question of amendment of the petition relates to a stage anterior to the trial enumerates certain matters in respect of which the <ORG> is to have the powers of a court under the Civil Procedure Code and as amendment of pleadings is not one of them VI must be held to have been excluded from its jurisdiction the Act makes a distinction between procedure and powers extends the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code to proceedings before <ORG>s only in respect of procedure and power to order amendment under While the word trial standing by itself is susceptible of both the narrow and the wider senses indicated above the question is what meaning attaches to it in and to decide that we must have regard to the context and the setting of the enactment If trial for the purpose of is to be interpreted as meaning only the hearing then what is the provision of law under which the <ORG> is to call for written statements and settle issues Section enacts that when an election petition does not comply with the provisions of or the <ORG> may dismiss it But if it does not dismiss it it must necessarily have the powers to order rectification of the defecte arising by reason of non compliance with the requirements of or section Section enacts that the <ORG> shall have powers in respect of various matters which are vested in a court under the Civil Procedure Code when trying a suit and among the matters set out therein are discovery and inspection enforcing attendance of witnesses and compelling the production of documents which clearly do not form part of the hearing but precede it The second contention urged on behalf of the appellants is that if the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code are held to be applicable in their entirety to the trial of election petitions then there was no need to provide under that the <ORG> was to have the powers of courts under the Code of Civil Procedure in respect of the matters mentioned therein as those powers would pass to it under While under the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code are applicable only subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder there is no such limitation as regards the powers conferred by It is then argued that confers powers on the <ORG> in respect of certain matters while applies the Civil Procedure Code in respect of matters relating to procedure that there is a distinction between power and procedure and that the granting of amendment being a power and not a matter of procedure it can be claimed only under and not under a When the respondent applied to the <ORG> for amendment he took a procedural step and that he was clearly entitled to do under The question of power arises only with reference to the order to be passed on the petition by the <ORG> Is it to be held that the presentation of a petition is competent but the passing of any order thereon is not We are of opinion that there is no substance in this contention either The last contention is based on the provision in that the procedure prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure is to apply subject to the provisions of the Act and the Rules It is argued that is a special provision relating to amendments and that it must be construed as excluding The true scope of the limitation enacted in on the application of the procedure under the Civil Procedure Code is that when the same subject matter is covered both by a provision of the Act or the rules and also of the Civil Procedure Code and there is a conflict between them the former is to prevail over the latter Section relates only to amendment of particulars and when the amendment sought is one of particulars that section will apply to the exclusion of any rule of the Civil Procedure Code which might conflict with it though it does not appear that there is any such rule In this view there is no scope for the application of the maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius on which the appellants rely In Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes Tenth Edition pages the position is thus stated Provisions sometimes found in statutes enacting imperfectly or for particular cases only that which was already and more widely the law have occasionally furnished ground for the contention that an intention to alter the general law was to be inferred from the partial or limited enactment resting on the maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius The only inference which a court can draw from such superfluous provisions which generally find a place in Acts to meet unfounded objections and idle doubts is that the legislature was either ignorant or unmindful of the real state of the law or that it acted under the influence of excessive caution The respondent then applied for an order dismissing the petition on the ground that it could not go on in the absence of <NAME> This order was challenged on the ground that there was no power in the <ORG> to order a new party to be impleaded But this Court repelled this contention and held on a review of the provisions of the Act including that the <ORG> had the power to pass the order in question under This is direct authority for the position that trial for purposes of includes the stages prior to the hearing of the petition and the word I procedure therein includes power to pass orders in respect of matters not enumerated in In <NAME> <NAME> it was held that Procedure in and I powers in were interchangeable terms that the procedure applicable under was wider than what would be applicable to the hearing of a suit and that the <ORG> had power in a proper case to order amendment of a petition We are of opinion that the law was correctly laid down in <NAME> <NAME> and in agreement with it we hold that the <ORG> has power in appropriate cases to direct amendment of the petition under VI It is next contended for the appellants that even if does not exclude the application of time allowed therefor and that accordingly no amendment should be allowed which would have the effect of defeating that provision The correctness of this order was questioned on the ground that on the date of the application for amendment a fresh petition on those allegations would be barred and that therefore the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the order which it did In upholding this contention Lord <NAME> observed that section gave power to the <ORG> to amend the petition that that power was subject to the provisions of the Act that one of those provisions was which prescribed the period within which an election petition could be filed that the power of amendment could be exercised only subject to this provision and that accordingly an amendment which raised a new charge should be rejected if a fresh petition on that charge would be barred on that date In <NAME> and others <NAME> the application was to amend the petition by adding a new charge and it was held tha that could not be done after the expiry of the period of limitation fixed in the Act for filing an election petition and the decision was put on the ground that the power to grant amendment was subject to the provisions of the Act On these authorities it is contended for the appellants that even if the <ORG> is held to possess a power to order amendments generally under an order under that Rule cannot be made when a new ground or charge is raised if the application is made beyond the period of limitation prescribed for filing election petitions It is argued for the respondent that the allegation in para really means that the appellants had in fact enlisted the support of <ORG> servants and that that amounts to a charge under of the Act of procuring the assistance of <ORG> servants for furtherance of their election prospects This suggests that the charge which the respondent sought to level against the appellants was that they moved in public so closely with high dignitaries as to create in the minds of the voters the impression that they were favoured by them And again in the objection filed by the appellants to the application of the respondent for amendment they stated that it was doubtful whether even the original allegation in para amounted to a major corrupt practice within of the Act The <ORG> does not deal with this aspect of the matter and simply assumes that the petition as presented did raise a charge under The allegation is not clear whether the <ORG> servants were asked by the appellants to support their candidature or whether they were asked to assist them in furtherance of their election prospects and there is no allegation at all that the <ORG> servants did in fact assist the appellants in the election There is considerable force in this contention Nothing further is heard of this charge until we come to December when respondents and who sailed with the petitioner filed statements alleging that the appellants had obtained the assistance from <ORG> servants including <NAME> in furtherance of their election prospects It should be mentioned that there is no provision of law under which a replication could be filed as a matter of right nor was there an order of the <ORG> allowing it On February the appellants opened their arguments at the hearing of the preliminary issue and thereafter with a view to remedy the defects which must have been then pointed out the respondent filed his present application for amendment to deal with the further contention of the appellants that there is no legal evidence in support of the finding of the <ORG> that they had obtained the assistance of four Mukhias in furtherance of their election prospects Then there is the question whether the first appellant has as held by the <ORG> again by a majority contravened of the Act Both these are undoubtedly expenses incurred in connection with the election and have in fact been shown by the first appellant in the return of election expenses against column Now the contention of the respondent which has found favour with the <ORG> is that both <NAME> and <NAME> must be held to have been employed for payment in connection with the election and as with their addition the number of persons allowed to be employed under Schedule VI has been exceeded the corrupt practice mentioned in of the Act has been committed That is wholly insufficient to establish that there was a contract of employment of those persons by him It was argued for the respondent that there could be a contract of employment in respect of piece work as of time work and that the evidence of the first appellant was material on which the <ORG> could come to the conclusion to which it did It may be conceded that a contract of employment may be in respect of either piece work or time work but it does not follow from the fact that the contract is for piece work that it must be a contract of employment There is in law a well established distinction between a contract for services and a contract of service and it was thus stated in <NAME> <ORG> In the one case the master can order or require what is to be done while in the other case he can not only order or require what is to be done but how it shall be done We must accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order of the <ORG> and dismiss the election petition filed by the respondent with costs of the appellants throughout
