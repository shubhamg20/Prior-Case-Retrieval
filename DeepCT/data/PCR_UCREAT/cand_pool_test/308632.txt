Subsequently a fresh Notification was issued under Section only in respect of the premises No a and excluding the common passage and notices were issued under Sections and of the Act requiring interested persons to file application for compensation Writ Petition having been filed Challenging the notices issued under sections and was registered as Writ Petition No of <ORG> quashed the notices issued under Sections of the Act by Order dated and it was further directed that the vacant possession of the disputed premises should be handed over within a period of six months The aforesaid Writ Petition had been filed by the owner of the premises in question On a fresh Notification was issued under Sections and of the Act for the purpose of use of <ORG> Public Notices of substance of the declaration was also given at the convenient places in the locality in two daily newspapers published on The learned Single Judge of <ORG> disposed of the Writ Petition by judgment dated by holding that the Notification issued under Sections and as well as invocation of Section and dispensing with hearing under Section A of the Act is not assailable <ORG> of <ORG> by judgment dated having allowed the appeal and having quashed the acquisition proceeding the Special Land Acquisition Officer has approached this <ORG> <ORG> in the impugned judgment came to hold that grave urgency and emergency being the pre condition for invoking powers under sub sections and of Section and in the case in hand no such urgency having been present invocation of power under Section gets vitiated and therefore the commencement of the acquisition proceeding must be held to be not in accordance with law In reply to the submission of the counsel appearing for the respondents to the effect that the object of invoking the urgency clause under Section being to take immediate possession of the acquired land and in the case in hand that possession being with <ORG> ever since the premises stood requisitioned under the provisions of requisition under West Bengal Act of the very pre condition of attracting Section was non existent it is stated that the earlier possession was not the possession of a lawful owner and the Notification for acquisition having been quashed by the <ORG> on two earlier occasions the acquiring authority felt the necessity of urgent acquisition and therefore the contention of the respondents counsel is unsustainable Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for one of the respondent and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for other respondents vehemently urged that in respect of a land which is under possession of <ORG> or any other authority the emergency power under Section of the Act cannot be invoked inasmuch as the legislature have conferred power to take possession of the acquired land even without complying with the provision of Section A of the Act only in case of grave emergency where the acquisition cannot brook the delay of days period which is contemplated for filing of Petition under Section A In this view of the matter when the <ORG> takes a decision taking all relevant considerations into account and is satisfied that there exists emergency for invoking powers under Section and of the Act and issues Notification accordingly the same should not be interfered with by the <ORG> unless the <ORG> comes to the conclusion that the appropriate authority had not applied its mind to the relevant factors or that the decision has been taken by the appropriate authority mala fide If an order invoking power under Section is assailed the <ORG>s may enquire whether the appropriate authority had all the relevant materials before it or whether the order has been passed by non application of mind Opinion of the State <ORG> can be challenged in a <ORG> of law if it could be shown that the State <ORG> never applied its mind to the matter or that action of the State <ORG> is mala fide Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles if the circumstances of the case in hand are examined it would appear that the premises in question was required for the students of <ORG> Calcutta and the Notification issued in December had been quashed by the <ORG> and the subsequent Notification issued on also had been quashed by the <ORG> It is only thereafter the Notification was issued under Section and of the Act on which came up for consideration before the High <ORG> It is indeed difficult for us to uphold the conclusion of <ORG> that acquisition is mala fide on the mere fact that physical possession had not been delivered pursuant to the earlier directions of a learned Single Judge of <ORG> dated The premises which was under occupation of the students of <ORG> Calcutta was obviously badly needed for the college and the appropriate authority having failed in their attempt earlier twice the orders having been quashed by <ORG> had taken the third attempt of issuing notification under Sections and of the Act such acquisition cannot be held to be mala fide and therefore the conclusion of <ORG> in the impugned Judgment that the acquisition is mala fide must be set aside and we accordingly set aside the same The arguments advanced on behalf of the respondents that as the premises in question continued to be under possession of <ORG> invocation of special powers under Section was vitiated and a valuable right of the land owners to file objections under Section A could not have been taken away According to the counsel for the respondents Section A of the Act merely gives an opportunity to the land owner to object to the acquisition within days from the date of publication of the notification under Section the power under Section dispensing with inquiry under Section A can therefore be invoked where there exists urgency to take immediate possession of the land but where possession is with the acquiring authority there cannot exist any urgency and therefore the exercise of that power is patently erroneous We therefore set aside the impugned Judgment of the Division Bench of Calcutta High <ORG> and hold that the acquisition in question is not vitiated on any ground
