Poverty there has been and there is in every country Indeed in a society where equality of status and opportunity do not obtain and where there are glaring inequalities in incomes there is no room for equality either equality before law or equality in any other respect At the same time with a view to ameliorate the conditions of women and children a provision was made in Clause that nothing in the said Article shall prevent the state from making any special provision for women and children At the same time care was taken to declare in Clause that nothing in the said Article shall prevent the state from making any provision for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizen which in the opinion of the state is not adequately represented in the services under the state Article abolishes the untouchability while Article prohibits conferring of any titles not representing military or academic distinction Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children Nothing in this article or in Clause of Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Nothing in this article shall prevent <ORG> from making any law prescribing in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an office under the Government of or any local or other authority within a State of Union territory any requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to such employment or appointment Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of apointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> Noting in this article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination It is evident that the weaker sections of the people do include the backward class of citizens contemplated by Article Part XVI of the Constitution contains special provisions relating to certain classes Clause provides that the President shall cause all such reports to be laid before <ORG> along with a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations relating to the Union and the reasons for the non acceptance if any of any of such recommendations It reads where any such report or any part thereof relates to any matter with which any <ORG> Government is concerned a copy of such report shall be forwarded to the Governor of the <ORG> who shall cause it to be laid before <ORG> along with a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations relating to the <ORG> and the reasons for the non acceptance if any of any of such recommendations Article provides that the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of a State There was a demand for similar reservations at the center The terms of reference of the <ORG> were The terms of reference of the <ORG> were i to determine the criteria for defining the socially and educationally backward classes ii to recommend steps to be taken for the advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens so identified iii to examine the desirability or otherwise of making provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of such backward classes of citizens which are not adequately represented in public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of any State and iv present to the President a report setting out the facts as found by them and making such recommendations as they think proper Reference is made to several caste associations which have come into being after the Constitution As the above three groups are not of equal importance for our purpose separate weightage was given to Indicators in each group The multiple approach adopted by the <ORG> is set out in para which reads Thus the <ORG> has adopted a multiple approach for the preparation of comprehensive lists of Other Backward Classes for all the States and Union Territories Backward Hindu Castes Communities Remaining Hindu castes groups which come in the category of Other Backward Classes Backward Non Hindu Communities of religious groups under Section may also be treated as OBCs But all these are ideas which <ORG> will take into account No action was however taken on the basis of the Mandal Commission Report until the issuance of the Office Memorandum on th September What is the merit of the system itself That the section which has of the population gets in <ORG> employment Merely making programmes of economic benefit to various sections of the society will not do There is a very big force in the argument to involve the poorest in the power structure Now they are fighting for their honour as a human being A point was made by <NAME> that if there are different lists in different States how will the Union List harmonise It is so today in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes That has not caused a problem Soon after the issuance of the said Memorandum there was wide spread protest in certain Northern States against it The undersigned is directed to invite the attention to of even number dated the th August on the above mentioned subject and to say that in order to enable the poorer sections of the SEBCs to receive the benefits of reservation on a preferential basis and to provide reservation for other economically backward sections of the people not covered by any of the existing schemes of reservation Government have decided to amend the said Memorandum with immediate effect as follows i Within the of the vacancies in civil posts and services under <ORG> reserved for <ORG>s preference shall be given to candidates belonging to the poorer sections of the <ORG>s Let us notice at this stage what do the two memorandums say read together Though the first Memorandum stated that the orders made therein shall take effect from they were not in fact acted upon on account of the orders made by this <ORG> They read as follows Whether Article is an exception to Article and would be exhaustive of the right to reservation to posts in services under the <ORG> II What would be the content of the phrase Backward Class in Article of the Constitution and whether caste by itself could constitute a class and whether economic criterion by itself could identify a class for Article and whether backward Classes in Article would include the Article as well III If economic criterion by itself could not constitute a Backward Classes under Article whether reservation of posts in services under the <ORG> based exclusively on economic criteria would be covered by Article of the Constitution IV Can the extent of reservation to posts in the services under the <ORG> under Article or if permitted under Articles and together exceed of the posts in a cadre or Service under the <ORG> or exceed of the appointment in a cadre or Service in any particular year and can such extent of reservation be determined without determining the inadequacy of representation of each class in the different categories and grades of Services under the <ORG> Does Article permit the classification of Backward Classes into Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes or permit Classification among them based on economic or other considerations VI Would making any provision under Article for reservation by the State necessarily have to be by law made by the Legislatures of the State or by law made by <ORG> Or could such provisions be made by an executive order VII Will the extent of judicial review be limited or restricted in regard to the identification of Backward Classes and the percentage of reservations made for such classes to a demonstrably perverse identification or a demonstrably unreasonable percentage VIII Would reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any Backward Class be restricted to the initial appointment to the post or would it extend to promotions as well For the sake of convenient discussion and in the interest of clarity we found it necessary to elaborate them We shall proceed to answer them in the same order The reframed questions are a Whether the provision contemplated by Article must necessarily be made by the legislative wing of the <ORG> If the answer to Clause a is in the negative whether an executive order making such a provision is enforceable without incorporating it into a rule made under the proviso to Article a Whether Clause of Article is an exception to Clause of Article Whether Clause of Article is exhaustive of the special provisions that can be made in favour of backward class of citizens Whether it is exhaustive of the special provisions that can be made in favour of all sections classes or groups Whether reservations can be made under Clause of Article or whether it permits only extending of preferences concessions a What does the expression backward class of citizens in Article means Whether backward classes can be identified on the basis and with reference to caste alone Whether a class to be designated as a backward class should be situated similarly to the Cs To what extent can the reservation be made a Whether the rule enunciated in <NAME> a binding rule or only a rule of caution or rule of prudence Whether the rule if any is confined to reservations made under Clause of Article or whether it takes in all types of reservations that can be provided under Article Further while applying rule if any whether an year should be taken as a unit or whether the total strength of the cadre should be looked to Whether <NAME> was correctly decided Whether Article permits reservations being provided in the matter of promotions Before we proceed to deal with the question we may be permitted to make a few observations The questions arising herein are not only of great moment and consequence they are also extremely delicate and sensitive Though we are sitting in a larger Bench we have kept in mind the relevance and significance of the principle of Stare decisis Where a decision has stood the test of time and has never been doubted we have respected it unless of course there are compelling and strong reasons to depart from it There are occasions when the obvious needs to be stated and we think this is one such occasion We are dealing with complex social constitutional and legal questions upon which there has been a sharp division of opinion in the <ORG> which could have been settled more satisfactorily through political processes We are reminded of what Sir <NAME> Chief Justice of Australia once said Society exhibits more signs of conflict and disagreement today than it did before Governments have always had the option of leaving questions to be determined by the courts according to law There are other reasons of course that cause governments to leave decisions to be made by <ORG> PART II Before we proceed to answer the questions aforementioned it would be helpful to notice a the debates in <ORG> on Article draft Article the decisions of this <ORG> on Articles and and a few decisions of the Supreme <ORG> considering the validity of race conscious programmes Omitting draft Clause which corresponds to Clause of Article the three clauses in draft Article as introduced in <ORG> read as follows Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any class of citizens who in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> <NAME> replied in the following words Before we start the general discussion i would like to place a particular matter before the Honourable Members There are other classes of people who are socially backward they also require adequate representation in the service That being so we have to find out some generic term and the word backward class was the best possible term His speech which put an end to all discussion and led to adopting of draft Article is worth quoting in extenso since it throws light on several questions relevant herein there are three points of view which it is necessary for us to reconcile if we are to produce a workable proposition which will be accepted by all That I think if I may say so is the justification why <ORG> undertook on its own shoulders the responsibility of introducing the word backward which I admit did not originally find a place in the fundamental right in the way in which it was passed by this <ORG> Somebody asked me What is a backward community Well I think any one who reads the language of the draft itself will find that we have left it to be determined by each local Government Soon after the enforcement of the Constitution two cases reached this Court from the <ORG> of Madras one under Article and the other under Article The Court pointed out that while in the case of employment under the <ORG> Clause of Article provides for reservations in favour of backward class of citizens no such provision was made in Article but because of the necessity for making a provision for reservation of such posts in favour of a backward class of citizens but the ineligibility of the petitioner for any of the posts reserved for communities other than Harijans and Backward Hindus cannot but be regarded as founded on the ground only of his being a Brahmin <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent State of Bihar placed strong reliance on the above passage Mr <NAME> points out that <ORG> took note of the fact that Schedule III was nothing but a collection of certain communities notified as backward classes and yet upheld the reservation in their favour Hardly any decision refers to <ORG> notwithstanding the fact that <ORG> was a decision rendered with reference to Article Soon after the said two decisions were rendered the <ORG> intervened and in exercise of its constituent power amended Article by inserting Clause which reads Nothing in this article or in Clause of Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes I think it has to be borne in mind and it is one of the fundamental principles which I believe is stated in <NAME> edition on the very first page that there is no Hindu who has not a caste The reservation made under Clause of Article should be reasonable The Rule may provide that the vacancies reserved for Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes shall not be filled up by general open competition candidates in case of non availability of <ORG> candidates and that such vacancies shall be carried forward During the years to this Court had to consider the validity of identification of backward classes made by Madras and Andhra Pradesh Governments In this state of the pleadings we must come to the conclusion that though the list is prepared caste wise the castes included therein are as a whole educationally and socially backward and therefore the list is not violative of Article Another Constitution Bench took a similar view in <NAME> In our opinon there was sufficient material to enable the <ORG> to be satisfied that the persons included in the list are really socially and educationally bakcward No doubt there are few instances where the educational average is slightly above the <ORG> average but that circumstances by itself is not enough to strike down the entire list Even assuming there are few categories which are little above the <ORG> average in literacy that is a matter for the <ORG> to take note of and review the position of such categories of persons and take a suitable decision We respectfully agree with these observations <ORG> had by amending Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules empowered the <ORG> to exempt by order for a specified period any member or members belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes and already in service from passing the test which an employee had to pass as a precondition for promotion to next higher post Exercising the said power the <ORG> of Kerala issued a notification granting temporary exemption to members already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests unified special or departmental test for a period of two years He contended that Article permits only reservations in favour of backward classes but not such an exemption We do not wish to burden this judgment by reproducing them here The rule giving preference to an un represented or under represented backward community does not contravene Articles or The learned Judge pointed out if we read Article as an exception to Article then the inescapable conclusion would be that Article does not permit any classification at all because an express provision has been made for this in Clause Furthermore if no classification can be made under Article except reservation contained in Clause then the mandate contained in Article would be defeated Among the minority <NAME> <NAME> preferred the view taken in <NAME> and other cases to the effect that Article is an exception to Article <NAME> <NAME> opined that the present reservations should continue for a further period of years making a total of years from the date of commencement of the Constitution It upheld the constitutionality of the Admissions Policy By the time the matter reached the stage of final hearing <NAME> had arrived in the final quarter of the last term He said the Equal Protection Clause did not enact a requirement that Law Schools employ as the sole criterion for admissions a formula based upon the LSAT Law School Admission Test and under graduate grades nor does it prohibit law schools from evaluating an applicant prior achievements in light of the barriers that he had to overcome The matter was carried in direct appeal to <ORG> which not only affirmed <ORG> Judgment in so far as it held the special admission programme to be invalid but also granted admission to the plaintiff respondent into <ORG> They based their judgment mainly on Title VI of Civile Rights Act which provided that no person in the United States shall on the ground of race colour or national origin be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any programme or activity receiving Federal Financial assistance He was of the opinion that while preference can be provided in favour of minority races in the matter of admission setting up of quotas which have the effect of foreclosing consideration of all others in respect thereof is not necessary for achieving the said compelling goal He sustained the admission granted to <NAME> on the ground that the <ORG> failed to establish that even without the quota he would not have been admitted While preferences can be provided in favour of disadvantaged sections reservation of seats which had the effect of excluding members of a race or races from those seats altogether is not permissible At the same time the preferred applicants have the opportunity to compete for every seat in the class We may next notice the decision in <NAME> <NAME> Lawyers Ed Indeed he posed the same question in this form Whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the <ORG>ional objectives and proceeded to answer the same after referring exhaustively to the earlier decisions of the court relating to school admissions in the following words We held that just as the race of students must be considered in determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy <NAME> <NAME> speaking for himself <NAME> and <NAME> J<NAME> in his concurring opinion pointed out the approach to be adopted in judging the validity of the race conscious programmes and concluded with these resounding words In my separate opinion in <NAME> I recounted the ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro long condoned under the Constitution and concluded that the position of the Negro today in America is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment I there stated It is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we now must permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race in making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence affluence and prestige in America We may now examine the decision in <ORG> <ORG> rendered on June Copies of the decision have been made available to us by <NAME> counsel for <ORG> In other words it is held that it is not necessary that the court apply a strict standard of scrutiny to evaluate racial classification to ascertain whether it is necessary for achieving the relevant objective and further whether it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest We have examined the decisions of <ORG> at some length only with a view to notice how another democracy is grappling with a problem similiar in certain respects to the problem facing this country Four Judges including <NAME> took the view that such a reservation was not barred by the Fourteenth Amendment while the other four including <NAME> took the view that the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Right Acts bars all race conscious progammes At the same time there are a series of decisions relating to school desegregation from <NAME> to <ORG> <NAME> Ed nd where the court has been consistently taking the view that if race be the basis of discrimination race can equally form the basis of remedial action PART III QUESTIONS AND We may now proceed to deal with the questions aforementioned He submits that since the provision made under Article affects the fundamental rights of other citizens such a provision can be made only by the <ORG> <ORG> He submits that if the power of making the provision is given to the executive it well give room for any amount of abuse Now would it be reasonable possible or practicable to say that the <ORG> or the <ORG> of the <ORG> should provide for reservation of posts appointments in the services of all such bodies besides providing for in respect of services under the <ORG> <ORG> Government This aspect would become clearer if we notice the definition of Law in Article a With respect to the argument of abuse of power by the political executive we may say that there is adequate safeguard against misuse by the political executive of the power under Article in the provision itself Question Whether an executive order making a provision under Article is enforceable forthwith A question is raised whether an executive order made in terms of Article is effective and enforceable by itself or whether it is necessary that the said provision is enacted into a law made by the appropriate <ORG> under Article or is incorporated into and issued as a Rule by the President Governor under the proviso to Article for it to become enforceable Mr <NAME> submits that Article is merely declaratory in nature that it is an enabling provision and that it is not a source of power by itself A Constitution Bench of this Court in <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the Bench has observed Article does not confer upon <ORG> the power to make rules relating to conditions of service of judicial officers attached to district courts and the courts subordinate thereto Whenever it was intended to confer on any authority the power to make any special provisions or rules including rules relating to conditions of service the Constitution has stated so in express terms Be that as it may there is yet another reason why we cannot agree that the impugned Memorandums are not effective and enforceable the moment they are issued It is further held by this Court that even where Rules under the proviso to Article are made the government can issue orders instructions with respect to matters upon which the Rules are silent There is nothing in them suggesting even distantly that they were issued under the proviso to Article They are executive orders issued under Article of the Constitution read with Clause of Article In <NAME> it was held there is no doubt that Article has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles and Following <NAME> it was held by another Constitution Bench by majority in <NAME> further this Court has already held that Clause of Article is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause Regarding the view expressed in Balaji and <NAME> it must be remembered that at that time it was not yet recognised by this Court that Article being a facet of Article does implicitly permit classification Thus from any point of view the contention of the petitioners has no merit Before we answer this question it is well to examine the meaning and content of the expression reservation The question is whether the said words contemplate only one form of provision namely reservation simplicitor or do they take in other forms of special provisions like preferences concessions and exemptions There was no provision for reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotion to the category of Upper Division Clerks There is no reason why such a special provision should not be held to be included within the larger concept of reservation The word any and the associated words must be given their due meaning In our opinion therefore where the <ORG> finds it necessary for the purpose of giving full effect to the provision of reservation to provide certain exemptions concessions or preferences to members of backward classes it can extend the same under Clause itself There are two views on this aspect For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs we must reject the argument that Clause of Article permits only extending of preferences concessions and exemptions but does not permit reservation of appointments posts What kind of special provision should be made in favour of a particular class is a matter for the <ORG> to decide having regard to the facts and circumstances of a given situation subject of course to the observations in the preceding paragraph In the light of the fact that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also intended to be beneficiaries of Article there is no reason why caste cannot be an exclusive criteria for determining beneficiaries under Article He submitted that economic criteria may be employed as one of the indicators for identification of backward classes but once a backward class is identified as such there is no question of excluding any one from that class on the basis of income or means or on any other economic criterion He referred to centuries of injustice meted out by upper castes to shudras and panchamas and submitted that these castes must now be given a share in the governance of the country which alone will assure their dignity besides instilling in them a sense of confidence and a spirit of competition The reason is that the reservation is not being made in favour of castes simplicitor but on the ground that they are backward castes classes which are not adequately represented in the services of the <ORG> Even if there are instances of under inclusion or over inclusion such errors do not vitiate the entire exercise In <NAME> case this Court observed that in respect of the vacancies reserved for backward classes of Hindus the petitioner a Brahmin cannot have any claim inasmuch as those reserved posts were reserved not on the ground of religion race caste etc but because of the necessity for making a provision for reservation of such post in favour of a backward class of citizens There is no rule of law that a test of basis adopted must be uniformly applicable to the entire population in the country as such In <NAME> <NAME> speaking for a Constitution Bench took it as well settled that the expression backward classes in Article means the same thing as the expression any socially and educationally backward class of citizens in Article We have referred to these decisions at some length in paras and This issue was gone into in some detail in Vasant Kumar where all the five Judges constituting <ORG> expressed different opinions We shall first refer to various Rules in force in several parts of India where these expressions were used and notice how were these expressions defined and understood If we bear this generalization in mind our study of the genesis of caste would be very much facilitated for we have only to determine what was the class that first made itself into a caste for class and caste so to say are next door neighbours and it is only a span that separates the two In Legal Thesaurus Regular Edition the following meanings are given to the word class Assortment bracket branch brand breed caste category classification classes denomination designation division gradation grade group grouping hierarchy sect social rank social status The following meanings are given to the word caste in Webster English Dictionary a race stock or breed of men or animals one of the hereditary classes into which the society of India is divided in accordance with a system fundamental to Hinduism reaching back into distant antiquity and dictating to every orthodox Hindu the rules and restrictions of all social intercourse and of which each has a name of its own and special customs that restrict that occupation of its members and their intercourse with the members of the other classes a a division or class of society comprised of persons within a separate and exclusive order based variously upon differences of wealth inherited rank or privilege profession occupation the position conferred by caste standing By adding the word backward and by the speeches of Dr <NAME> and Sri <NAME> it was made clear that the class of citizens not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> meant only those classes of citizens who were not so represented on account of their social backwardness Indeed there are very good reasons why the Constitution could not have used the expression castes or caste in Article and why the word class was the natural choice in the context The word class in Article in our opinion is used in the sense of social class and not in the sense it is understood in Marxist jargon For the sake of completeness we may refer to a few passages from <NAME> to show what does the concept of caste signify <NAME> defines and describes caste in the following terms What then is a caste Though caste has been discussed by scholars and jurists no precise definition of the expression has emerged The concept of purity and impurity conceptualises the caste system There are four essential features of the caste system which maintained its homo hierarchicus character hierarchy commensality restrictions on marriage and hereditary occupation At the outset we may state that for the purpose of this discussion we keep aside the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes since they are admittedly included within the backward classes except to remark that backward classes contemplated by Article do comprise some castes for it cannot be denied that Scheduled Castes include quite a few castes There is no set or recognised method There is no law or other statutory instrument prescribing the methodology Any authority entrusted with the task of identifying backward classes may well start with the castes Indeed there is no such thing as a standard or model procedure approach We must also say that there is no rule of law that a test to be applied for identifying backward classes should be only one and or uniform Since the decision in Balaji it has been assumed that the backward class of citizens contemplated by Article is the same as the socially and educationally backward classes Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes mentioned in Article However it is now settled that the expression backward class of citizens in Article means the same thing as the expression any socially and educationally backward class of citizens in Article It is true that no decision earlier to it specifically said so yet such an impression gained currency and it is that impression which finds expression in the above observation It may be remembered that Article which has remained unamended does employ the expression socially and educationally backward classes and yet that expression does not find place in Article Thus Cs referred to in Article is only one of the categories for whom Article was enacted Article applies to a much larger class than the one contemplated by Article It is necessary to state at this stage that <ORG> appointed under Article was concerned only with the socially and educationally backward classes contemplated by the said Article It is submitted that they constitute the forward section of that particular backward class as forward as any other forward class member and that they are lapping up all the benefits of reservations meant for that class without allowing the benefits to reach the truly backward members of that class In this behalf the learned Counsel invited our attention to Chapter pages to of the <ORG> Tamil Nadu Second Backward Classes Commission Report It is submitted that no member of backward class has come forward with this plea and that it ill becomes the members of forward classes to raise this point The very concept of a class denotes a number of persons having certain common traits which distinguish them from the others Difficulty however really lies in drawing the line how and where to draw the line For while drawing the line it should be ensured that it does not result in taking away with one hand what is given by the other Even otherwise there are several practical difficulties too in imposing an income ceiling At the same time it must be recognised that there are certain positions the occupants of which can be treated as socially advanced without any further enquiry It is then argued for the Respondents that one swallow doesn make the summer and that merely because a few members of a caste or class become socially advanced the class caste as such does not cease to be backward Keeping in mind all these considerations we direct <ORG> to specify the basis of exclusion whether on the basis of income extent of holding or otherwise of creamy layer Reliance is placed upon the observations of <NAME> in Vasant Kumar at page where dealing with the above observations in Balaji the learned Judge said We do not think that these observations were meant to lay down any proposition that the socially Backward Classes were those classes of people whose conditions of life were very nearly the same as those of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes There is no point in attempting to determine the social backwardness of other classes by applying the test of nearness to the conditions of existence of the Scheduled Castes We see no reason to qualify or restrict the meaning of the expression backward class of citizens by saying that it means those other backward classes who are situated similarly to Scheduled Castes and or Scheduled Tribes Article does not expressly refer to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes if so there is no reason why we should treat their backwardness as the standard backwardness for all those claiming its protection There is no warrant to import any such a priori notions into the concept of Other Backward Classes It must be left to the authority appointed to identify It is not correct to say that the backward class contemplated by Article is limited to the socially and educationally backward classes referred to in Article and Article The classes contemplated by Article may be wider than those contemplated by Article Sufficed it to mention that the said principles apply equally in the case of a constitutional provision like Article which expressly places the particular fact inadequate representation within the subjective judgment of the <ORG> executive It follow from the discussion under Question No that a backward class cannot be determined only and exclusively with reference to economic criterion We see no reason to differ with the said view inasmuch as this is but another method to find socially backward classes It is submitted that in principle there is no justification for the said holding We are of the opinion that there is no constitutional or legal bar to a <ORG> categorizing the backward classes as backward and more backward We are concerned with the question if a <ORG> makes such a categorisation whether it would be invalid We think not Let us take the criteria evolved by <ORG> Any caste group or class which scored eleven or more points was treated as a backward class Now it is not as if all the several thousands of castes groups classes scored identical points There may be some castes groups classes which have scored points between to and there may be some who have scored points between eleven and thirteen It cannot reasonably be denied that there is no difference between these two sets of castes groups classes If both of them are grouped together and reservation provided the inevitably result would be that gold smiths would take away all the reserved posts leaving none for vaddes In such a situation a <ORG> may think it advisable to make a categorisation even among other backward classes so as to ensure that the more backward among the backward classes obtain the benefits intended for them The Backward Classes have been divided into four categories Group comprises professional group like tappers weavers carpenters ironsmiths goldsmiths kamsalins etc Group pertains to Scheduled Castes converts to Christianity and their progency while Group comprises of all other classes communities groups which are not included in groups A and The vacancies reserved for backward classes are sub divided between them in proportion to their respective population There is another way of looking at this issue Article recognises only one class viz Even so it is beyond controversy that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are also included in the expression backward class of citizens and that separate reservations can be provided in their favour What is the logic behind it It is that if Scheduled Tribes Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes are lumped together Cs will take away all the vacancies leaving Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes high and dry The same logic also warrants categorisation as between more backward and backward We are only saying that if a <ORG> chooses to do it it is not impermissible in law PART QUESTION NOS AND Question To what extent can the reservation be made a Whether the rule enunciated in <NAME> a binding rule or only a rule of caution or rule of prudence Whether the rule if any is confined to reservations made under Clause of Article or whether it takes in all types of reservations that can be provided under Article Further while applying rule if any whether an year should be taken as a unit or whether the total strength of the cadre should be looked to The interests of weaker sections of society which are a first charge on the <ORG> and the center have to be adjusted with the interests of the community as a whole In <ORG> this rule of was applied to a case arising under Article and on that basis the carry forward rule was struck down At the same time Clause of Article does not fix any limit on the power of the government to make reservation Suppose for instance a State has a large number of backward class of citizens which constitute of the population and the Government in order to give them proper representation reserves of the jobs for them can it be said that the percentage of reservation is bad and violates the permissible limits of Clause of Article The answer must necessarily be in the negative <NAME> agreed with the view taken by <NAME> in the following words I agree with my learned brother <NAME> in the view that the arithmatical limit of in any one year set by some earlier rulings cannot perhaps be pressed too far I agree with his construction of Article and his view about the carry forward rule In <NAME> two learned judges came to precisely opposite conclusions on this question On the other hand it is argued for the respondents that when the population of the other backward classes is more than of the total population the reservation in their favour excluding Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can also be Just as every power must be exercised reasonably and fairly the power conferred by Clause of Article should also be exercised in a fair manner and within reasonably limits and what is more reasonable than to say that reservation under Clause shall not exceed of the appointments or posts barring certain extra ordinary situations as explained hereinafter From this point of view the reservation provided by the impugned Memorandums in favour of backward classes is well within the reasonable limits The provision under Article conceived in the interest of certain sections of society should be balanced against the guarantee of equality enshrined in Clause of Article which is a guarantee held out to every citizen and to the entire society There are two types of reservations which may for the sake of convenience be referred to as vertical reservations and horizontal reservations This is how these reservations are worked out in several States and there is no reason not to continue that procedure It is however made clear that the rule of shall be applicable only to reservations proper they shall not be indeed cannot be applicable to exemptions concessions or relaxations if any provided to Backward Class of Citizens under Article The next aspect of this question is whether an year should be taken as the unit or the total strength of the cadre for the purpose of applying the rule <NAME> speaking for the majority says We would like to emphasise that the guarantee contained in Article is for ensuring equality of opportunity for all citizens relating to employment and to appointments to any office under the <ORG> In order to effectuate the guarantee each year of recruitment will have to be considered by itself and the reservation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities Neither should be allowed to eclipse the other For the above reason we hold that for the purpose of applying the rule of an year should be taken as the unit and not the entire strength of the cadre service or the unit as the case may be namely vacancies arising in three successive years and being the reservation quota and examine We however agree that an year should be taken as the unit or basis as the case may be for applying the rule of and not the entire cadre strength It is submitted that providing for reservation thereafter in the matter of promotion amounts to a double reservation and if such a provision is made at each successive stage of promotion it would be a case of reservation being provided that many times Examples are given how two persons A and one belonging to category and the other belonging to reserved category having been appointed at the same time the member of the reserved category gets promoted earlier and how even in the promoted category he jumps over the members of the category already there and gains a further promotion and so on <NAME> learned Counsel appearing for <ORG> raised a preliminary objection to the consideration of this question at all Learned counsel reiterated the well established principle of Constitutional Law that Constitutional questions should not be decided in vacuum and that they must be decided only if and when they arise properly on the pleadings of a given case and where it is found necessary to decide them for a proper decision of the case He submits that an appointment to a post is made either by direct recruitment or by promotion or by transfer In such a situation it is argued plain words of the Constitution should be given their due meaning and that there is no warrant for cutting down their ambit on the basis of certain suppositions with respect to interpretation of Clauses and But it must be remembered that reference to this larger <ORG> was made with a view to finally settle the legal position relating to reservations But before we proceed to express ourselves on the question a few clarifications would be in order Secondly there may be a service class category to which appointment is made partly by direct recruitment and partly by promotion i promotion on the basis of merit Take the category of Assistant Engineers in a particular service where of the vacancies arising in a year are filled up by direct recruitment and by promotion by selection i on merit basis from among Junior Engineers It held that the word appointments in Clause did not denote promotion and further that the word posts in the said clause referred to posts outside the cadre concerned On appeal this Court reversed by a majority of <NAME> speaking for the majority enunciated certain propositions of which the following are relevant for our discussion a matters relating to employment in Clause must include all matters in relation to employment both prior and subsequent to the employment which are incidental to the employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment in regard to employment like other terms and conditions associated with and incidental to it the promotion to a selection post is also included in the matters relating to employment and even in regard to such a promotion to a selection post all that Article guarantees is equality of opportunity to all citizens who enter service The condition precedent for the exercise of the powers conferred by Article is that the <ORG> ought to be satisfied that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in its services Reservation of appointments or posts may theoretically and conceivably means some impairment of efficiency but then it explains it away by saying but the risk involved in sacrificing efficiency of administration must always be borne in mind when any <ORG> sets about making a provision for reservation of appointments of posts We see no justification to multiply the risk which would be the consequence of holding that reservation can be provided even in the matter of promotion It is well known that direct recruitment takes place at several higher levels of administration and not merely at the level of Class IV and Class Ill It may equally be true that on the basis of that decision reservation may have been provided in the matter of promotion in some of the <ORG> and <ORG> services but we are convinced that the majority opinion in Rangachari to the extent it holds that Article permits reservation even in the matter of promotion is not sustainable in principle and ought to be departed from However taking into consideration all the circumstances we direct that our decision on this question shall operate only prospectively and shall not affect promotions already made whether on temporary officiating or regular permanent basis It is further directed that wherever reservations are already provided in the matter of promotion be it <ORG> Services or <ORG> Services or for that matter services under any corporation authority or body falling under the definition of <ORG> in Article such reservations shall continue in operation for a period of five years from this day In his dissenting opinion in <NAME> While holding that there is no conflict between Article and Article he did say it is inevitable in the nature of reservation that there will be a lowering of standards to some extent but he said on that account the provision cannot be said to be bad inasmuch as in that case the <ORG> had as a matter of fact prescribed minimum qualifications and only those possessing such minimum qualifications were appointed It is submitted by the learned Counsel for petitioners that reservation necessarily means appointment of less meritorious persons which in turn leads to lowering of efficiency of administration While on Article we are of the opinion that there are certain services and positions where either on account of the nature of duties attached to them or the level in the hierarchy at which they obtain merit as explained hereinabove alone counts It is enough to say on this question that there is no particular or special standard of judicial scrutiny in matters arising under Article or for that matter under Article The extent and scope of judicial scrutiny depends upon the nature of the subject matter the nature of the right affected the character of the legal and constitutional provisions applicable and so on At the same time we must say that court would normally extend due deference to the judgment and discretion of the <ORG> a co equal wing in these matters backward and more backward the expression preference must be read down to mean an equitable apportionment of the vacancies reserved for backward classes among them By now it is well settled that reservations in educational institutions and other walks of life can be provided under Article just as reservations can be provided in services under Article Where however the <ORG> does not agree with its recommendation it must record its reasons therefor Even it any new class group is proposed to be included among the other backward classes such matter must also be referred to the said body in the first instance and action taken on the basis of its recommendation Such a body can be created under Clause of Article itself or under Article read with Article as a concomitant of the power to identify and specify backward class of citizens in whose favour reservations are to be provided Now that we have answered all the questions raised for our consideration question new arises whether in view of the answers given and directions being given by us is it necessary to send back the matter to <ORG> to consider whether the investigation and survey done and conclusions arrived at by <ORG> are contrary to law and if so whether the impugned Office Memorandums based as they are on the report of the said <ORG> can be sustained We think not This is not a case where <ORG> framed certain questions and referred them to this Bench Otherwise we heard the counsel fully on the alleged illegalities in the approach and methodology adopted by the <ORG> Regarding the non Hindu Communities i an employee will be deemed to be socially backward if either he is a convert from those Hindu communities which have been defined as socially backward as per para a i above or in case he is not such a convert his parental income is below the prevalent poverty line i Rs According to the petitioners the survey must be an exhaustive one like the one done by Venkataswamy <ORG> in Karnataka which also forms the basis of Justice Chinnappa Reddy <ORG> Report <ORG> while justifying the Report has taken the stand that even if there are any errors or inadequacies in the work and report of the <ORG> it is no ground for throwing out the report altogether more particularly when <ORG> has taken care by marrying the <ORG> lists with the <ORG> lists May be there are certain errors in actual exercise of identification in the nature of over inclusion or under inclusion as the case may be Such <ORG> which will have the power to receive evidence and enquire into disputed questions of fact can more appropriately decide such complaints than this Court under Article In this view of the matter it is unnecessary for us to express any opinion on the correctness or adequacy of the exercise done by <ORG> In a social measure like the impugned one the court must give due regard to the judgment of the <ORG> a co equal wing of the <ORG> and approach the measure in the spirit in which it is conceived We are told that in the State of Madhya Pradesh a list of Other Backward Classes has been prepared but it has been stayed by <ORG> <NAME> An executive order making a provision under Article is enforceable the moment it is made and issued It must be left to the authority appointed to identify <NAME> It is not correct to say that the backward class of citizens contemplated in Article is the same as the socially and educationally backward classes referred to in Article There is no constitutional bar to classify the backward classes of citizens into backward and more backward categories The rule of should be applied to each year This rule shall however have only prospective operation and shall not affect the promotions already made whether made on regular basis or on any other basis If is further directed that wherever reservations are already provided in the matter of promotion be it <ORG> or <ORG> or for that matter services under any <ORG> authority or body falling under the definition of <ORG> in Article such reservations may continue in operation for a period of five years from this day While the rule of reservation cannot be called anti meritarion there are certain services and posts to which it may not be advisable to apply the rule of reservation <NAME> There is no particular or special standard of judicial scrutiny applicable to matters arising under Article Where however the <ORG> does not accept the advice it must record its reasons therefor Economic criterion cannot be the sole basis for determining the backward class of citizens contemplated by Article There is no constitutional bar to classification of backward classes into more backward and backward classes for the purposes of Article Reservation of appointments or posts under Article is confined to initial appointment only and cannot extend to providing reservation in the matter of promotion It is further directed that wherever reservations are already provided in the matter of promotion be it <ORG> or <ORG> or for that matter services under any <ORG> authority or body falling under the definition of State in Article such reservations may continue in operation for a period of five years from this day Therefore the views expressed in this judgment on the said point are not the views of <NAME> THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS ARE GIVEN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA The founding fathers of our Constitution have designedly couched Articles and in comprehensive phraseology so that the frail and emaciated section of the people living in proverty rearing in obscurity possessing no wealth or influence having no education much less higher education and suffering from social repression and oppression should not be denied of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws and equal opportunity in the matters of public employment or subjected to any prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion race caste sex or place of birth Confining to the issue involved in this case as regards the equal opportunity in the matters of public employment I venture to articulate without any reservation even on the possibility of any refutation that it is highly deplorable and heart rending to note that the constitutional provision namely namely Clause of Article proclaiming a Fundamental Right enacted about years ago for providing equality of opportunity in matters of public employment to people belonging to any backward class has still not been given effect to in services under <ORG> and many more States In fact a three Judges Bench of this Court comprised of <NAME> CJ and <NAME> and <NAME> JJ as the learned Chief Justices then were taking note of the widespread violence by their order dated st September made the following appeal to the general public and particularly the student community After we made order on th September we had appealed to counsel and those who were in the <ORG> room to take note of the fact that the dispute has now come to the apex court and it is necessary that parties and the people who were agitated over this question should maintain a disciplined posture and create an atmosphere where the question can be dispassionately decided by this <ORG> There is no justification to be panicky over any situation and if any one rights are prejudiced in any manner certainly relief would be available at the appropriate stage and nothing can happen in between which would deter this <ORG> from exercising its power in an effective manner The Hindus who form the majority in our country are divided into Varnas namely Brahmins Kshatriyas Vaishyas who are all twice born and lastly Shudras which Varnas are having a four tier demarcated hierarchical caste system based on religious tenets believed to be of divine origin or divinely ordained otherwise called the Hindu Varnasharma Dharma There are various Constitutional provisions such as Articles and which are designed to redress the centuries old grievances of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes as well as the backward classes and which have come for judicial interpretation on and off Backward Hindu Castes Communities Remaining Hindu castes groups which come in the category of Other Backward Classes Backward Non Hindu Communities of religious groups under Section may also be treated as OBCs The approximate derived population of Other Backward Classes including non Hindu Communities Aggregate of rounded This is a derived figure Figures in brackets give the population of among these non Hindu Communities Within the of the vacancies in civil posts and services under <ORG> reserved for <ORG> preference shall be given to candidates belonging to the poorer sections of the <ORG> The expression deployed in both the OMs Socially and Educationally Backward Classes is on the strength of the Report of the Commission though no such expression is used in Article whereunder the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens is to be made This expression is used as an explanatory one to the words backward class occurring in Article <NAME> who intended to join <ORG> on enquiries came to know that in respect of admissions into <ORG> the authorities were enforcing and observing an order of the <ORG> namely notification No Education dated commonly known as Communal which restricted the number of seats in <ORG> Colleges for certain castes Jawahar Lal Nehru the then Prime Minister while moving the Bill to amend the Constitution stated as follows We have to deal with the situation where for a variety of causes for which the present generation is not to blame the past has the responsibility there are groups classes individuals communities if you like who are backward The fact is therefore that if we wish to encourage them in regard to these matters we have to do something special for them Therefore one has to keep a balance between the existing fact as we find it and the objective and ideal that we aim at Article expressly permits the <ORG> to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> As the power conferred on the <ORG> under this Clause is to be exercised only if in the opinion of the <ORG> that there is no adequate representation in the services under the <ORG> a vital question arose for consideration whether the issue of determination by the <ORG> as to whether a particular class of citizens is backward or not is a justiciable one holding thus While the <ORG> has necessarily to ascertain whether a particular class of citizens are backward or not having regard to acceptable criteria it is not the final word on the question it is a justiciable issue The power under Clause is also conditioned by the fact that in regard to any backward classes of citizens there is no adequate representation in the services under the <ORG> The opinion of the <ORG> in this regard may ordinarily be accepted as final except when it is established that there is an abuse of power The discussion and debate took place at length for and against the introduction of Clause as well as for the insertion of the word backward I would particularly ask him to refer to the vast storehouse of law reports with regard to the Constitution of the United States Canada and other countries That I think if I may say so is the justification why <ORG> undertook on its own shoulders the responsibility of introducing the word backward which I admit did not originally find a place in the fundamental right in the way in which it was passed by this <ORG> somebody asked me What is a backward community Well I think any one who reads the language of the draft itself will find that we have left it to be determined by each local Government If the local Government included in this category of reservations such a large number of seats I think one could very well go to <ORG> and <ORG> and say that the reservation is of such a magnitude that the rule regarding equality of opportunity has been destroyed and the court will then come to the conclusion whether the local Government or <ORG> has acted in a reasonable and prudent manner There is a galaxy of decisions of this Court explaining the words backward class as occurring under Article in relation to Articles and which I shall recapitulate in my endeavour to meet the arguments advanced by the learned Counsel appearing for various parties in interpreting the words backward class In interpreting the words backward class I am sorry to say there is no uniform and consistent view expressed by the <ORG> by laying down a rigid formula exhaustively listing out the specific criteria As to the questions whether caste can be taken as a criterion in determining and identifying a backward class in Hindu society and whether it could be a pre dominant factor or one of the factors in identifying the backward class there is a cleavage of opinion There is a galaxy of decisions of this <ORG> in explaining the words backward class and caste which I shall refer to at the appropriate place Similarly in Article also they would have used the words as backward caste or castes instead of backward class As stated earlier there are sufficient indications in the Constitution to suggest that the Scheduled Castes are not mere castes There is a long line of decisions dealing with the significance of the word caste in relation to Hindus as being one of the relevant criteria if not the sole criterion for ascertaining whether a particular person or group of persons will fall within the wider connotation of class We would also like to make it clear that if in a given situation caste is excluded in ascertaining a class within the meaning of Article of the Constitution it does not vitiate the classification if it satisfied other tests It is true that Clause of Article contains a non obstante clause with the result that power conferred by that clause can be exercised despite the provisions of Clause of Article and Clause of Article This is not because they are members of that caste or community but because they form a class There are marked distinctions in one form or another among various sections of the Muslim community especially among converts to <ORG> though <ORG> does not recognise such kind of divisions among Muslims and professes only common brotherhood Reference may be made to paragraphs to of Chapter XII of the Report In this connection reference may be made to the observation of this <ORG> in Chitralekha supra that if in a given situation caste is excluded in ascertaining a class within the meaning of Article of the Constitution it does not vitiate the classification if it satisfied other tests The noted and renowned Sociologist <NAME> in Rise Awakening of Depressed Classes in India published by <ORG> New Delhi has quoted a passage from the issue of Hindu dated as an example of visual pollution existing in Tinnevelli Tamil Nadu which <ORG> has extracted in Chapter IV vide para of its report In this Tinnevelly district there is a class of unseeables called purada vannans The reservation for the backward classes was challenged on the ground that the Government Order violated Article read with Article and that the reservation was not saved by Article No doubt we are aware that any provision made under this clause must be within the well defined limits and should not be on the basis of caste alone The subsequent amended dated states that in order to enable the poorer sections of the <ORG>s to receive the benefits of reservation on a preferential basis and to provide reservation for other economically backward sections of the people not covered by any of the existing schemes of reservation the <ORG> have decided to amend the earlier Memorandum As the above three groups are not of equal importance for our purpose separate weightage was given to Indicators in each group <NAME> in <NAME> while dealing with the observations made in Balaji that the backward classes for whose improvement special provision is contemplated by Article are in the matter of their backwardness comparable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes observed thus There is no point in attempting to determine the social backwardness of other classes by applying the test of nearness to the conditions of existence of the Scheduled Castes Adopting the policy of Running with the hare and hunting with the hounds a conciliatory argument was advanced saying that although it is necessary to make provisions for providing equality of opportunity in matters of public employment in favour of any backward class in terms of Article the present Report based on census can never serve a correct basis for identifying the backward class that therefore a fresh <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is required to be appointed to make a fresh wide survey sumey through out the length and breadth of the country and submit a new list of OBCs other backward classes on the basis of the present day <ORG> and that there are million ways of guaranteeing progress of backward classes and ensuring that it percolates down the social scale but the <ORG> commission is the one It was only after the identification of OBCs the <ORG> was faced with the task of determining their population percentage and at that stage census become relevant It is brought to our notice that the same method had already been adopted in Section of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order Amendment Act In fact this position is made clear by the <ORG> itself in Chapter XII of its Report the relevant paragraphs of which read thus Systematic caste wise enumeration of population was introduced by <ORG> in and discontinued in It is therefore in order to achieve equality of employment opportunity Clause of Article empowers the <ORG> to provide permissible reservation to SEBCs in the matters of appointments or posts as a remedy so as to set right the manifest imbalance in the field of public employment The argument that the implementation of the recommendations of the <ORG> would result in demoralisation and discontent has no merit because conversely can it not be said that the non implementation of the recommendations would result in demoralisation and discontent among the SEBCs Though equal protection clause prohibits the <ORG> from making unreasonable discrimination in providing preferences and facilities for any section of its people nonetheless it requires the <ORG> to afford substantially equal opportunities to those placed unequally It is more appropriate to recall that There is equality only among equals and to equate unequals is to perpetuate inequality There is no question of rewriting the Constitution because the <ORG> has acted only under the authority of the notification issued by the President Though theoretically they are given equal opportunity to run the race in practice the ordinary horse is not given an equal opportunity to compete with the race horse And what is merit There is no merit in a system which brings about such consequences Secondly even among the Judges of <ORG> of United <ORG> there is a division of opinion on the theory of lingering effects of past discrimination There was no clear majority but a three way split namely four Judges took one view and four other Judges took a different view leaving Justice <NAME> straddling the middle Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> articulated that Articles and are so worded as to give a wide latitude to the <ORG> in the matter of reservation and that Article having no obstinate clause reading Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision has an over riding effect on Article Yet another argument placing reliance on <NAME> case I supra was advanced contending that Article is an enabling provision conferring a discretionary power on the <ORG> to make a reservation of appointments in favour of backward class of citizens In my view that Clause of Article is not an exception to Article and but it is an enabling provision and permissive in character overriding Article and that it is a source of reservation for appointments or posts in the <ORG> so far as the backward class of citizens is concerned and that under Clause of Article reservation for appointments or posts can be made to other sections of the society such as physically handicapped etc There is complete unanimity of judicial opinion of this Court that under Article the <ORG> can make adequate provisions for reservations of appointments of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens if in the opinion of the <ORG> such backward class is not adequately represented in the <ORG> Whether the power conferred under Article is coupled with duty Mr <NAME> put forth an argument that the enabling power conferred under Article is intended for the benefit of the backward classes of citizens who in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the <ORG> under the <ORG> and that the power is one coupled with a duty and therefore has to be exercised by the state for the benefit of those for whom it is intended What is best for the backward class and in what manner the policy should be formulated and implemented bearing in mind the object to be achieved by such reservation is a matter for decision exclusively within the province of the <ORG> and such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review or judicial interference except on the grounds which are well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court It was for the first time that this <ORG> in <NAME> has indicated broadly that the reservation should be less than and the question how much less than would depend on the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case Though in <NAME> the issue in dispute related only to the reservation prescribed for admissions in the medical college from the educationally and socially backward classes scheduled caste and scheduled tribes as being violative of Article this <ORG> after expressing its view that it should be less than observed further that the provisions of Article are similar to those of Article Therefore what is true in regard to Article is equally true in regard to Article reservation made under Article beyond the permissible and legitimate limits would be liable to be challenged as a fraud on the Constitution Mr <NAME> strongly articulated that the observation in Balaji that reservation under Article should not be beyond is only an obiter dicta since that question did not at all arise for consideration in that case According to him the policy of reservation is in the nature of affirmative action firstly to eliminate the past inhuman discrimination and secondly to ameliorate the sufferings and reverse the genetic damage so that the people belonging to backward class can be uplifted In fact my learned brother <NAME> in his separate judgment has also expressed a similar view that there is no legal infirmity in keeping the reservations under Clause alone or under Clause and Clause of Article together exceeding per cent though for other reasons the learned Judge has concluded that ordinarily the reservations kept under Article and together should not exceed of the appointments in a cadre or service in any particular year but for extraordinary reasons this percentage may be exceeded In fact Article itself does not limit the power of the <ORG> in making the reservation to any maximum pecentage but it depends upon the quantum of adequate representation required in the <ORG> The question of percentage of reservation was examined in <NAME> wherein <NAME> not agreeing with <NAME> has observed thus Clause of Article does not fix any limit on the power of the <ORG> to make reservation Suppose for instance a <ORG> has a large number of backward classes of citizens which constitute of the population and the <ORG> in order to give them proper representation reserves of the jobs for them can it be said that the percentage of reservation is bad and violates the permissible limits of Clause of Article The answer must necessarily be in the negative Chinnappa Reddy in Karamchari case SCR supra has expressed his view on the ceiling of reservation as follows There is no fixed ceiling to reservation or preferential treatment in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes though generally reservation may not be far in excess of fifty percent Every case must be decided with reference to the present practical results yielded by the application of the particular rule of preferential treatment and not with reference to hypothetical results which the application of the rule may yield in the future I fully share the above views of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> holding that no maximum percentage of reservation can be justifiably fixed under Articles and or of the Constitution The most important pivotal and crucial issue that I would now like to ponder over relates to the intent of para i of the OM dated th September whereunder it is declared that Within the of the vacancies in civil posts and services under <ORG> reserved for <ORG>s preference will be given to the candidates belonging to the poorer sections of the <ORG>s The <ORG> uses the expression poorer in its comparative term for the word poor It is stated that the preference will be given first to the poorer sections and only in case there are unfilled vacancies those vacancies will be filled by the left out SEBCs namely those other than the poorer sections The view that all the identified SEBCs are considered as poor or poorer is fortified by the fact that there is an inbuilt explanation in the amended <ORG> itself to the effect that those who do not fall within the category of poorer sections also will be entitled for the benefit of reservation but of course subject to the availability of unfilled vacancies The same view is reflected in a subsequent Order dated th December made by <ORG> the relevant part of which reads thus Learned Additional Solicitor General states that the Government definitely expects to be able to fix the economic criteria by January As far as the question of stay granted by us earlier is concerned we see no reason to pass any order at this stage as the petitions are posted for hearing on January and in view of the economic criterion not being yet determined and other relevant circumstances no question of immediate implementation of the notification arises Therefore I proceed on the basis that the second OM identifies the poorer sections only on the basis of economic status When the means test is analysed in depth so as to explore its merits and demerits one would come to an inevitable conclusion that it is not a decisive test but on the other hand it will serve as a protective umbrella for many to get into this segregated section by adopting all kinds of illegal and unethical methods I would like to indicate the various reasons in support of my opinion that this process of elimination or exclusion of a section of people from and out of the same category of SEBCs cannot be sustained leave apart the authority of the Government to take any decision and formulate its policy in its discretion or opinion provided that the policy is not violative of any constitutional or legal provisions or that discretion or opinion is not vitiated by non application of mind arbitrariness formulation of collateral grounds or consideration of irrelevant and extraneous material etc When the Government has accepted and approved the lists of SEBCs identified by the test of social backwardness educational backwardness and economic backwardness which lists are annexed to the Report there is no justification by dividing the SEBCs into two groups thereby allowing one section to fully enjoy the benefits and another on a condition only if there are unfilled vacancies This process of elimination or exclusion of a section of <ORG> will be tentamount to pushing those persons into the arena of open competition along with the forward class if there are no unfilled vacancies out of the total meant for <ORG> In this connection I would like to mention the views of <ORG> as expressed by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in the Chief Ministers Conference held in New Delhi already referred to stating that the application of income limit on reservation will exclude those people whose income is above the cut off limit and literally it means that they will come under the open competition quota and if caste is not the sole criterion income limit cannot also be the decisive and determining factor for social backwardness and that the exclusion of certain people from the benefits of reservation by the application of economic criterion will not bring the desired effect for the advancement and improvement of the backward classes who have suffered deprivation from the time immemorial We have referred to the above facts for the purpose of showing that the fixation of ceiling limit on economic criterion was not successful and that for identifying the weaker sections ceiling limit is not the proper test once the backward class is identified and ascertained By way of illustration it is said that if a member of a designated backward class holds a high post by getting through the qualifying examinations of <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> or any other <ORG> there can be no justification in extending the benefit of reservation to their children because the social status is will advanced and they no longer suffer from the grip of poverty But the question is whether those individuals belonging to any particular caste community or group which satisfies the test of backward class should be segregated picked up and thrown over night out of the arena of backward class One should not lose sight of the fact that the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens in the <ORG> services have not yet been put in practice in spite of the impugned OMs It is after years since the advent of our Constitution the Government is taking the first step to implement this scheme of reservation for OBCs under Article There are a few decisions of this Court which I have already referred to holding the view that even if a few individuals in a particular caste community or group are socially and educationaly above the general average neither that caste nor that community or group can be held as not being socially backward Therefore in such circumstances I have my own doubt whether the judicial supremacy can work in the broad area of social policy or in the great vortex of ideological and philosophical decisions directing the exclusion of any section of the people from the accepted list of OBCs on the mere ground that they are all creamy layers which expression is to be tested with reference to various factors or make suggestions for exclusion of any section of the people who are otherwise entitled for the benefit of reservation in the decision of the <ORG> so long that decision does not suffer from any constitutional infirmity Added to the above submission it has been urged that some pseudo communities have smuggled into the backward classes and they should be removed from the list of OBCs lest those communities would be eating away the major portion of the reservation which is meant only for the true and genuine backward classes There are judicial pronouncements to the effect that <ORG> has got the right of reviewability There cannot be any controversy indeed there is none that the <ORG> which is certainly interested in the maintenance of standards of its administration possesses and retains its sovereign authority to adopt general regulatory measures within the consitutional framework by reviewing any of its schemes or policies Thereafter a Constitution Bench of this <ORG> by their order dated st October explained the earlier order stating Three out of us sitting as a Bench on the st September made an order after hearing parties wherein we had indicated that the decision to implement three aspects of the recommendations of <ORG> was a political one and ordinarily the <ORG> would not interfere with such a decision Therefore by striking down para i of the amended OM as unconstitutional I hold that there is no legal impediment in implementing para i of the first OM dated th August which has not been supersed rescinded or repealed but deemed to have been amended for government services with a view to give them equal opportunity to compete and keep pace with the advanced sections of the people SCC a three Judges Bench of this Court to which I was a party has taken a view that once candidates even from reserved communities are allocated and appointed to a Service based on their ranks and performance and brought under the one and same stream of category then they too have to be treated on par with all other selected candidates and there cannot be any question of preferential treatment at that stage on the ground that they belong to reserved community though they may be entitled for all other statutory benefits such as the relaxation of age the reservation etc Hence I share the view of my learned brother <NAME> holding that Article does not permit provision for reservation in the matter of promotions and that this rule shall however have only prospective operation and shall not affect the promotions already made whether made on regular basis or on any other basis and the direction given by him that wherever reservations are provided in the matter of promotion such reservation may continue in operation for a period of five years from this day It has an over riding effect on Article and The power conferred on the <ORG> under Article is one coupled with a duty and therefore the <ORG> has to exercise that power for the benefit of all those namely backward class for whom it is intended Para i and ii of the amended Office Memorandum dated th September for the reasons given in my judgment and the conclusions drawn above are struck down as being violative of Article So there is no legal impediment in immediately enforcing and implementing this first Office Memorandum of In Writ Petition No of Sreenarayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam <ORG> there is a prayer prayer inter alia for issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to implement the impugned unamended office memorandum dated th August The amended Office Memorandum dated th September provides i Within the of the vacancies in civil posts and services under <ORG> reserved for <ORG>s preference shall be given to candidates belonging to the poorer sections of the <ORG>s In regard to non Hindus the Report says There is no doubt that social and educational backwardness among non Hindu communities is more or less of the same order as among Hindu communities The Report has thus treated all persons who belong or who had once belonged to what had been regarded as untouchable or other traditionally backward caste or communities or who belong to certain low occupations as socially educationally and economically backward The particulars of the Mandal Report and other material relied on by the <ORG> in making the impugned orders do not directly arise for our consideration at this juncture as this Bench has been constituted to examine the concept of equality of opportunity in matters of public employment as enshrined in Article and other provisions of the Constitution and settle the legal position relating to reservation and thus lay down the guideline by which the validity and reasonableness of <ORG> Orders on reservation can be tested in appropriate cases The Constitution permits valid classification founded on an intelligible differentia distinguishing persons or things grouped together from others left out of the group In <ORG> during the discussions on draft Article Article several members belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes expressed serious apprehension that the expression backward was not precise and large sections of people who did not belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes were likely to claim the benefit of reservation at the expense of the truly backward classes of people When it is read with Article it is perfectly clear that the word backward signifies that class of people does not matter whether you call them untouchables or touchables belonging to this community or that a class of people who are so backward that special protection is required in the services and I see no reason why any member should be apprehensive of regard to the word backward emphasis supplied Backward class is composed of persons whose backwardness is in degree and nature comparable to that of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes whatever be their religion In that event they form a class of people for the special protection of Articles and not by reason of their caste which is merely incidental but by reason of their social and educational backwardness which is identified to be the result of prior or continuing discrimination and its ill effects and which is comparable to that of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes For almost a century no action was taken and thus non action was with the approval of the <ORG> In Chitralekha the <ORG> observed that caste is only a relevant circumstance in ascertaining the backwardness of a class and there is nothing in the judgment of this <ORG> <NAME> which precludes the authority concerned from determining the social backwardness of a group of citizens if it can do so without reference to caste Article of the Constitution reads as under The President may by order appoint a <ORG> consisting of such persons as he thinks fit to investigate the conditions of socially and and educationally backward classes within the territory of India and the difficulties under which they labour and to make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by the <ORG> or any State to remove such difficulties and to improve their condition and as to the grants that should be made for the purpose by the <ORG> or any State and the conditions subject to which such grants should be made and the order appointing such <ORG> shall define the procedure to be followed by the <ORG> Any determination of social backwardness therefore cannot be valid unless these important aspects are taken into consideration But even in those times there was a section of society which was kept away deliberately from education as they were not permitted to enter the schools and colleges When <ORG> was appointed by the President under Article it was required to determine the criteria for determining the socially and educationally backward classes and to examine the desirability or otherwise of making provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of such backward classes of citizens which are not adequately represented in public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of any <ORG> As the above three groups are not of equal importance for our purpose separate weightage was given to Indicators in each group To comprehend the real meaning the provision itself the setting or context in which it has been used the purpose and background of its enactment should be examined and interpretational exercise may be resorted to only if there is a compelling necessity for it Even if two constructions of the provisions could have been possible the <ORG> must adopt that which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity and given rise to practical incovenience The social utility of preferential treatment extended to the disadvantage and weaker too should not be pushed too far on what happened in the past without looking to the present Dr <NAME> quoted this <NAME> thought in the Constituent Assembly Debate and exhorted let us prove by our conduct that we have not only the power but also the wisdom to carry with us all sectors of the country which is bound to lead us to unity What the Nation should remember is that the basic values of constitutionalism guaranting judicial independence is to enable the courts to discharge their duty without being guided by any philosophy as judicial interpretation gives better protection than the political branches to the weak and outnumbered to minorities and unpopular individuals to the inadequately represented in the political process Amongst them there was vertical and occupational divisions It was said by Lord <NAME> long back for America that classes way not be divided for political purposes into upper and lower and richer and poorer but according to their respective occupation they follow Any citizen has a right to challenge and court has obligation to strike it down by directing exclusion of such group from the backward class Where power is coupled with duty the condition precedent must exist for valid exercise of power Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> It was <ORG> which qualified the expression class of citizens by adding the word backward before it What should be deemed to be prohibited in the light of historical background cannot be brought back from the backdoor on principle developed by the American courts under Equal Protection Clause as they had to rise to the occasion due to absence of a provision like Article and the fractured interpretation put in the <NAME> house cases which eroded the very foundation of Equal Protective clause mainly intended for the benefit of Negro freedom Suppose for instance a <ORG> has a large number of backward classes of citizens which constitute of the population and the <ORG> in order to give them proper representation reserves of the jobs for them can it be said that the percentage of reservation is bad and violates the permissible limits of Clause of Article True as observed by <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> and <NAME> in <NAME> supra that there is no consitutional provision restricting reservation to but with profound respect the debates in <ORG> the provisions in the Constitution do not support the construction of Article as empowering government to reserve posts for backward class of citizens in proportion to their population Since there is no clear indication either way the role of the courts become both important and responsible by interpreting the provision reasonably and with common sense so as to carry out the objective of its enactment But the theory developed by <NAME> and <NAME> that equal Protection clause really dealt with the problem with the relation of two classes to each other one of individuals possessing the definite trait and the other of individuals tainted by the mischief at which the law aims said to be the first comprehensive analysis of the Equal Protection Clause may be applicable while considering the scope of Article but once the Constitution makers treated employment in services separately by creating fundamental right in favour of all citizens in pursuance of the ideal of Preamble to secure to all its citizens equality in opportunity and status then it has to be understood in its own perspective Observations by Dr <NAME> in Constituent Assembly Debates are quite pertinent If the local Government included in this category of reservations such a large number of seats I think one could very well go to <ORG> and <ORG> and say that the reservation is of such a magnitude that the rule regarding equality of opportunity has been destroyed and the court will then come to the conclusion whether the local Government or <ORG> has acted in a reasonable and prudent manner Although its purpose is manifold but the principle objective is to secure the best possible incumbents for the higher positions while maintaining the morale of the whole organisation as it not only serves the public interest but is founded on the inherent principle that the higher one moves the greater is the responsibility he assumes But a student admitted to a medical or engineering college is further not granted relaxation in passing the examinations As even if such a class or collectivity is held to fall in the broader concept of the expression backward class of citizens it would not be eligible for the benefit as it would be incapable of satisfying the other mandatory requirement of being inadequately represented in services without which the <ORG> cannot have any jurisdiction to exercise the power Protection was given to the appellants in effect or consequence of equal protection clause It may however not be out of place to mention that where rules framed under Rule exist no executive order in violation of it can be passed Vital issues by agreement of both sides relating to reservation and preferential treatment in services have been discussed Whether the report was within the term of reference and if the <ORG> in identifying socially and educationally backward class repeated the same mistake as was done by the first <ORG> and if the <ORG> could adopt two different yardsticks for determining backwardness among Hindus and non Hindus were aspects which were required to be gone into by the <ORG> before issuing any order Reservation by executive order may not be invalid but since it was being made for the first time in services under the <ORG> propriety demanded that it should have been laid before <ORG> not only to lay down healthy convention but also to consider the change in social economic and political conditions of the country as nearly ten years had elapsed from the date of submissions of the report a period considered sufficient for evaluation if the reservation may be continued or not
