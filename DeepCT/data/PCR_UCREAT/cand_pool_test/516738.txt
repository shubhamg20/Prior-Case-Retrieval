under Section read with Sections and of the Motor Vehicles Act According to the petitioner there is no existing need to provide any additional transport facilities in the above route or on its sector and that even the existing transport facilities are more than the need and he states that he is suffering heavy loss for want of passengers in his bus The st appellant refused to grant the same by endorsement dated stating that it is not possible to comply with the request as there are a number of applications received for grant of stage carriage permits on various sectors of the town It was further stated that the writ petitioner may as well ascertain the information from the copy of the agenda published in the notice board of the office of the <ORG> Then the petitioner filed the present writ petition stating that under Rule of the Rules he is entitled to certified copies of the said applications The petitioner also contended that there is no need to grant any permit on the route that no traffic survey was conducted to find out the need that there are no representations from the public for additional transport facilities and that no permit can legally be granted unless such need is first established The petitioner therefore prays for the issue of a writ of Certiorari for quashing the orders of the st appellant dated refusing to grant certified copies and for a positive direction for furnishing certified copies of all applications filed for grant of pucca stage carriage permits on the town service route The learned single Judge by his order dated allowed the writ petitions partly holding that the existing operators were entitled to have certified copies of the applications filed by third parties before the st or nd appellant if there was common sector between the route granted to the writ petitioner and the route for which fresh applications are made for grant of stage carriage permits and the impugned order was quashed The provisions of Rule according to him clearly negated such an assumption inasmuch as the proviso to the said rule unequivocally laid down that the <ORG> shall give adequate notice of the meetings and of the business to be transacted at the meetings for the information of such persons who being interested in the particular business to be transacted Under the new Rule the <ORG> has to bear in mind several guiding principles including whether the new operators are financially sound and whether their performance has been satisfactory Vinobha Devi who appeared for the new applicants supported his contention Though the contentions of the learned counsel for the writ petitioners covered a large ground we wish to make it clear even at the outset that we do not propose to decide by hypothetical questions It is neither necessary nor desirable for us to go into every aspect of the changes brought about by the new Act We have therefore confined our decision to a very narrow compass consisting of only three inter related questions concerning stage carriage permits firstly whether the existing operators have a legal right to file representations opposing the applications of new applicants after the commencement of the new Act secondly whether the existing operators have a right to be heard before fresh stage carriage permits are granted and thirdly whether at the stage of grant of new stage carriage permits the existing operators can claim a legal right under for grant of copies of the applications filed by the new applicants for the limited purpose of enabling the existing operators to file representations Under the old Act the procedure contained in required the factors stated in sub clauses a to thereof to be taken into account by the A and it was further specifically provided in that the A Shall also take into consideration any representation made by persons already providing passenger transport facilities by any means along or near the proposed route or area or by any association representing persons interested in the provisions of road transport facilities recognised in this behalf by <ORG> or by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies further permitted the <ORG> to limit the number of stage carriages generally or of any specified type for which stage carriage permits may be granted in the region or in any specified area or on any specified route within the region The deliberations decision under as to the number of permits are confined to the <ORG> administrative policy based on factors mentioned in and at the stage of there is no question of hearing the existing operators Thus even under the old Act at the stage of limiting the number of permits under there was no legal right vested in the existing operators either to file representations or to a right of hearing Under the old Act provided that if any person filed an application for a permit the same should be available for inspection that <ORG> should publish the application and contents thereof and further state that representations by existing operators would be received if sent within particular time old Act Procedure of Regional Transport Authority in considering application for stage carriage permit <ORG> shall in considering an application for a stage carriage permit have regard to the following matters namely a the interests of the public generally the advantages to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating or likely to operate in the near future whether by road or other means between the places to be served the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service the operation by the applicant of other transport services including those in respect of which applications from him for permits are pending the condition of the roads included in the proposed route or area and shall also take into consideration any representations made by persons already providing passenger transport facilities by any means along or near the proposed route or area or by any association representing persons interested in the provisions of road transport facilities recognised in this behalf by <ORG> or by any local authority or police authority within whose juris diction any part of the proposed route or area lies Provided that other conditions being equal an application for a stage carriage permit from a co operative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being shall as far as may be be given preference over applications from individual owner new Act Procedure of <ORG> in considering application for stage carriage permit A <ORG> shall while considering an application for a stage carriage permit have regard to the objects of this Act Provided that such permit for a route of fifty Kilometres or less shall be granted only to an individual or a <ORG> undertaking is made <ORG> shall dispose of the application at a public hearing at which the applicant and the person making the representation shall have an opportunity of being heard either in person or by a duly authorised representative new Act Procedure in applying for and granting permits <ORG> shall not ordinarily refuse to grant an application for permit of any kind made at any time under this Act Provided that <ORG> may summarily refuse the application if the grant of any permit in accordance with the application would have the effect of increasing the number of stage carriages as fixed and specified in a notification in the Official Gazette under cl a of sub sec of Provided further that where <ORG> refuses an application for the grant of permit of any kind under this Act it shall give to the applicant in writing its reasons for the refusal of the same and an opportunity of being heard in the matter It is important to note that there is no reference to any representation in of the New Act which corresponds to of the old Act All that states is that the <ORG> shall while considering the applications for stage carriage permit have regard to the objects of the Act There is also no reference to the factors a to referred to in or to the filing of any representations by the existing operators of associations local authority or police authorities Adverting to the right of a rival operator to object to the grant of the application of other persons <ORG> referred to Art Such a right to represent if it has to be conferred on an existing operator it can be done only by way of a law made under Art No right guaranteed to any private party by Art It is an enabling provision and does not confer a right on those already practising a profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business to exclude and debar fresh eligible entrants from practising that profession or from carrying on that occupation trade or business Even so the State Government had issued certain notifications dated and permitting grant of permits to all eligible applicants without any upper limit and said that the judgment was good as the law stood before the <ORG> Amendment Act and that once the <ORG> Legislature had itself changed the law in the State Government could not have issued notifications inconsistent with the amending Act of In <NAME> A Calcutta Region smaller taxis at cheaper rates were introduced by orders of the A and the same was questioned by taxi owners who were to charge higher rates on the ground that their business would be affected The contention was rejected by <ORG> holding that if other persons were also allowed the right to carry on the same occupation and an element of competition was introduced in the business that did not amount to violation of fundamental right guaranteed under Article It was held on an elaborate consideration of the case law that the said Act and Rules did not confer any substantive justiciable right on a rival in cinema trader to lodge an objection in response to a notice published under The proprietor of a <ORG> theatre holding a licence for exhibiting films had no legal right under the statutory provisions or under the general law which could be subjected to or threatened with injury as a result of the grant of no objection certificate to the rival trader After elaborately discussing the meaning of the words aggrieved person in various laws <ORG> observed see para Juridically harm of this description is called damnum sine injuria the term injuria here used in its true sense of an act contrary to law Salmond on Jurisprudence th Ed The reason why the law suffers a person knowingly to inflict harm of this description on another without holding him accountable for it is that such harm done to an individual is again to society at large It will eliminate healthy competition in this business which is so essential to raise commercial morality it will tend to perpetuate the appellant monopoly of cinema business in the town and above all it will in effect seriously injure the fundamental right of respondents and which they have under Art of the Constitution of India to carry on trade or business subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law of the Constitution of India it is clear that the existing operators have no legal right to object to the grant of a permit to rival operators Learned counsel for the writ peti tioners while accepting that there is no express provision in the new Act either in or conferring on the existing operators a legal right to file representations or for being heard have however contended that such a right has to be implied by law We shall now refer to this aspect of the matter All ER for the proposition that whenever an order is passed by any authority which is likely to affect the rights of another person such person must be given a reasonable opportunity to submit his objections It is also stated in these decisions that principles of natural justice are to be implied and that there can also be a post decisional opportunity in certain cases No doubt principles of natural justice can normally be implied even if there is no express provision therefore whenever the rights of a party are affected We have noticed that under the old Act there were provisions in Sec as well as and enabling existing operators to submit their representations and for a hearing to be given to them It is important to notice that under of the Town Police Clauses Act the <ORG> had a right to limit the number of licences Further there was an undertaking given on behalf of the <ORG> Emphasising the very special circumstances of the case the <ORG> read into the statute a duty to act fairly in accordance with the principles of natural justice Thus a corresponding right to be treated fairly was also imported by implication in favour of the applicants Viewed from this standpoint the applicants had an interest recognised in law which was adversely affected by the impugned action They had suffered a wrong as a result of the unfair treatment on the part of the <ORG> It was held that though the petitioner had locus standi to file a writ petition the petitioner legal rights as such were not affected and also that it had no right to be heard While locus standi occupied a larger area governing the right to approach the <ORG> under Art every such person could not claim a legal right to be heard before the <ORG> under of the said Act For the purposes of application of principles of natural justice the question according to the learned Judges was merely whether any legal power has been exercised over a person affecting his legal rights and not whether he has some legal right to move the <ORG>s It was then argued for the respondents by Sri <NAME> that the <ORG> was a quasi judicial tribunal and that it was a body exercising powers in public interest and therefore it ought to receive representations from existing operators and give them a right of hearing In our view the provisions of and in the new Act as compared with Ss and of the old Act clearly define the limits of the restrictions to be imposed in public interest under Art Further we are of the view that the question of filing any application for a certified copies of the orders decisions petition or documents referred to in arises only after the <ORG> disposes of the application for grant of stage carriage permit and not before that stage There is no provision for appeal by existing operators We do not think it necessary for the purpose of the cases before us to decide the question whether existing operators could file revisions under against orders granting stage carriage permit to applicants inasmuch as the matter in these writ petitions is still at the stage of grant of permits by the <ORG> and also because the question whether they had a right of revision will depend upon the scheme of the Act There was also some argument before us as to whether under of the new Act permits for stage carriage ought to be ordinarily granted as a matter of course in cases not covered by The only and limited question therefore decided by us is that whenever fresh applications are filed under read with Ss and of the new Motor Vehicles Act existing operators have no legal right file representations before the <ORG> Nor can they claim any right to be heard by the <ORG> It may however be open to them to send whatever representations they may like to send as a matter of information to the <ORG> but this they cannot claim as of right If any representations are so sent it is open to the <ORG> to consider them if there is anything relevant in the said representations They cannot also claim a right to be given certified copies under of the A Motor Vehicles Rules of any applications filed by fresh applicants who are seeking stage carriage permits on the ground that such copies are necessary for filing effective representations before the <ORG> We do not decide any other question or questions which may have been incidentally referred to during the arguments as it is not relevant for the question being decided by us For the aforesaid reasons the writ appeals are allowed the orders of the learned single Judge are set aside and the writ petitions are dismissed
