Held further that the reading out of the contents of the poiice report by the Chairman at the hearing of the appeal was enough compliance with the rules of natural justice as there was nothing in the rules requiring a copy of it to be furnished to any of the parties The Judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September passed by <ORG> of <ORG> reversing those of a single Judge of that <ORG> dated December refusing to issue a writ in the nature of a certiorari The facts of this case lie in a short compass and may be stated as follows <ORG> which will be referred to as the first respondent in the course of this judgment held seven permits for running buses on the Buldana Malkapur route as the sole operator on that route The appellant preferred an appeal to <ORG> constituted under of the Motor Vehicles Act Madhya Pradesh Nagpur which is the second respondent to this appeal At the hearing no objection appears to have been raised by any of the parties to the course adopted by the second respondent of the Constitution substantially on two grounds namely that the order passed by the second respondent was vitiated by an error apparent on the face of the record and that it contravened the principles of natural justice The appellant and the second respondent showed cause against the rule issued by the court The appellant while showing cause admitted that the third respondent had rejected its application on the basis of the police report dated March which was full of mistakes and falsehoods that it moved the District Superintendent of Police personally to verify the contents of the said report and that the fresh report submitted by the police after due verification had absolved the appellant from the allegations of misconduct contained in the first report It also controverted the ground that there was any mistake apparent on the face of the record The second respondent also showed cause and corroborated the appellant statement that the first police report had been subsequently modified by the District Superintendent of Police by the report dated May which showed that the previous report was based on some misunderstanding In the course of his judgment the learned Judge after referring in detail to the orders of the authorities under the Motor Vehicles Act that is to say the second and third respondents observed that there was no substance in the contention that the procedure adopted by <ORG> was opposed to the principles of natural justice and had operated to the prejudice of the first respondent and that there was no error apparent on the face of the record The first respondent preferred an appeal under the Letters Patent and repeated its grounds of attack against the orders of <ORG> <ORG> seemed to be inclined to negative the plea that there was a mistake apparent on the face of the record and pointed out that though the language used by the second respondent was ambi guous and not quite accurate it was possible to take the view that it had in fact considered the subsequent police report when it observed that the police bad practically absolved the appellant from all blame except on a minor question not necessary to be referred to in detail here In the result it granted a writ quashing the order of <ORG> and directing it to rehear the appeal in the light of the observations made in the course of the judgment The appellant made an application to <ORG> for a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court Having been unsuccessful there the appellant came up to this Court and obtained special leave to appeal It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the Appeal Bench of <ORG> has erred in coming to the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case there has been a failure of justice in disagreement with the learned single Judge who was clearly of the opposite opinion It has also been argued that there are no well defined criteria by which this question falls to be determined In this connection reference was made to the provisions of ss and of the Motor Vehicles Act read along with the relevant rules framed under of the Act On behalf of the respondents it was argued that it had no opportunity of studying the subsequent police report and of making submissions thereon with the result that there has been a failure of natural justice in the sense that the respondent had been deprived of a fair and full opportunity of being heard Though <ORG> on appeal did not base its decision on the other question namely whether there was any error apparent on the face of the record it was sought to be argued that there was an error in the order of the second respondent in so far as it made reference to only the first report and read into it the maatter contained in the subsequent report At the outset we may observe that in our opinion there is no substance in the second ground sought to be resuscitated in this Court by the learned counsel on behalf of the res We are not concerned with other grounds which may in the context of each particular case support a contention of error apparent on the face of the record In this case if there was any such error it was with reference to the two police reports The judgment under appeal did not take the view that there was any such mistake apparent on the face of the record as was contended for on behalf of the first respondent We have been referred to the orders of <ORG> as read by <ORG> of <ORG> and in our opinion no such mistake has been shown to have vitiated the orders impugned before <ORG> Coming back to the question whether or not there has been a failure of natural justice we may shortly review the relevant provisions of the statute in order to find out the obligations imposed upon <ORG> while disposing of an appeal from the orders of <ORG> The matters to be considered by <ORG> at the time of disposing of an application for a stage carriage permit are set out in The <ORG> is also enjoined to take into consideration any representations made by persons already providing road transport facilities along the proposed route or by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction the proposed route lies It also in terms provides that on an appeal being filed to the prescribed authority it shall give the appellant and the original authority that is to say the authority against whose orders the appeal had been brought Section which creates the right of appeal does not in terms speak of a like opportunity being given to the persons against whom the appeal had been filed thus be seen that though the substantive section creating the right of appeal does not in terms create any right in a respondent to be heard the rules framed providing for the procedure before the Appellate <ORG> contemplate that sufficient notice shall be given to any other person interested in the appeal which expression must include persons other than the appellant who may be interested in being heard against the points raised in support of the appeal Thus the Motor Vehicles Act and the rules framed thereunder with particular reference to <ORG> and <ORG> do not contemplate anything like a regular hearing in a court of justice But before we do that it has got to be observed that the question whether the rules of natural justice have been observed in a particular case must itself be judged in the light of the constitution of the statutory body which has to function in accordance with the rules laid down by the legislature and in that sense the rules themselves must vary The police authority within whose local jurisdiction any part of the proposed route lies has also been given the right to make representations In the present case when the subsequent police report was read out by the Chairman neither the appellant nor the first respondent nor for the matter of that any of the other parties raised any objection to the use of that document or asked for an adjournment on the ground either that it had been taken by surprise or that it had materials to offer in opposition to the report The learned Judges of <ORG> have observed in the course of their judgment under appeal that though it is the essence of the business of tribunals like the one under the Motor Vehicles Act to transact business expeditiously the business of the authority would not have suffered much if a copy of the report had been given to the parties concerned and the case adjourned for a short time It is incumbent on every tribunal which acts judicially to see that justice is not only done but is seen to be done arid that the elementary rule of natural justice of giving a fair and proper hearing to every one concerned is followed In our opinion <ORG> has made a number of assumptions in making those observations which do not appear to be justified by the scheme of the legislation we are dealing with or by any a priori considerations of what has been characterized as natural justice Hence in our opinion there was nothing in the rules requiring a copy of the police report to be furnished to any of the parties nor was there any circumstance necessitating the adjournment of the hearing of the appeal particularly when no request for such an adjournment had been made either by the first respondent or by any other party But the <ORG> appears to have taken the view that rule or no rule request or no request for an adjournment the rules of natural justice made it incumbent upon <ORG> to stay its hands in order that a proper and effective chance was given to the first respondent to state its case There was not much of a case to state because each party applying for the permit must be presumed to have pressed its claim upon <ORG> The earliest decision of <ORG> brought to our notice in this connection is the case of <NAME> <ORG> He is not a judge in the proper sense of the word but he must give the parties an opportunity of being heard before him and stating their case and their view He must give notice when he will proceed with the matter and he must act honestly and impartially and not under the dictation of some other person or persons to whom the authority is not given by law There would be no decision within the meaning of the statute if there were anything of that sort done contrary to the essence of justice But it appears to me to be perfectly consistent with reason that the statute may have intentionally A In such cases the <ORG> will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts I need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides for that is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as though it were a trial They have no power to administer an oath and need not examine witnesses They can obtain information in any way they think best always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view The Court repelled the argument that the appellant had a right to be heard by <ORG> and to know the contents of the report made by the inspector who had held the public local inquiry Rely <NAME> upon the judgment of Lord <NAME> in the case of <ORG> <NAME> supra the Court decided that the procedure indicated by the rules framed under the statute in question had been followed and that there was no other or further obligation on the <ORG> to hear the appellant either personally or through his representative or counsel because there was no indication in the statute to that effect The matter was taken in appeal in <NAME> Local Government <ORG> Ex parte A rlidge and <ORG> by a majority <NAME> and <NAME> <ORG> They therefore quashed the order dismissing the appeal It further held that the appellant before the <ORG> was entitled to a hearing and that as the appellant had not the opportunity of seeing and considering the report and the documents which the deciding authority had before it the appellant had been denied full opportunity of being heard It went to the length of observing that the nondisclosure of the report and the documents which were taken into consideration by the <ORG> when the disclosure had been asked for was itself inconsistent with natural justice Then he referred to a number of precedents dealing with the question of natural justice as to how the connotation of the expression differed in different contexts He further observed at pp Against the judgment of the majority of the <ORG> quashing the determination of the appeal by the <ORG> there was an appeal to <ORG> In the course of his speech Viscount <NAME> made the following observations My Lords when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially They must deal with the question referred to them without bias and they must give to each of the parties the opportunity of adequately presenting the case made The decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of responsibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice His Lordship adopted the dictum of Lord <NAME> in the leading case of <ORG> <NAME> supra Lord <NAME> in his speech made the following observations which are very apposite to the facts and circumstances of this case The judgments of the majority of the <ORG> below appear to me if I may say so with respect to be dominated by the idea that the analogy of judicial methods or procedure should apply to departmental action Lord <NAME> in his speech also reiterated the principle governing the procedure of a quasi judicial tribunal in these words Where however the question of the propriety of procedure is raised in a hearing before some tribunal other than a Court of law there is no obligation to adopt the regular forms of legal procedure Another recent decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <NAME> was relied upon by <ORG> in the judgment under appeal Further it appears to me very doubtful whether it is true that they have no power to administer an oath In view of those statutory provisions they found it necessary to uphold the decision of <ORG> which had set aside the judgment and orders of <ORG> which had taken the con tarry view to the effect that the decree in <ORG> was conclusive evidence on which <ORG> could act There is another class of cases which lay down that if a person is to be deprived of his professional status he must be heard and be given effective opportunity of meeting any allegation made against him on the question of his fitness to pursue his profession If the tribunal constituted by the statute in question to decide about the fitness of an individual to pursue that profession decides against him without giving him an opportunity of meeting any allegations against him bearing on his capacity or qualification for the profefession to which he claims admission it has been held that it was improper for the tribunal acting in a quasi judicial capacity to act to his prejudice upon evidence or adverse report without his having an opportunity of meeting such relevant allegations made against him The cases of <NAME> <ORG> and <NAME> <ORG> also belong to that category Those were cases in which <ORG> had to function as a quasi judicial body and had to proceed according to the procedure laid down in the rules framed under the Act aforesaid They had therefore to function not exactly as courts of law but as domestic tribunals created by the statute to function according to the statutory rules in a fair and just manner that is to say that they should have no personal interest in the con troversy and should have given a full and fair opportunity to the person proceeded against to place his case before the tribunal Acting under of the Benefices Exercise of the Rights of Presentation Measure the <ORG> repelled the argument on behalf of the disappointed patron that as the decision involved a deprivation of property rights there was an obligation upon the Archbishop to act in a quasijudicial manner <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> observed that there was no justification for regarding the matter when it comes before the Archbishop as in any sense or by any remote analogy a his inter parties Hence the <ORG> on a true construction of a of the Measure came to the conclusion that the Archbishop was not required to arrive at his decision by conducting a quasi judicial enquiry proposition that simply because property rights are involved the authorities charged with the duty of deciding claims to such rights are not necessarily apart from the provisions of the statute required to function as quasi judicial tribunals That Act has made ample provisions for safeguarding the interests of rival claimants for permits It also examined how far <ORG> exercising its special powers to issue writs under Art of the Constitution could interfere with the orders made by those authorities In the course of its judgment this Court made the following observations at page which are very relevant to the present purpose Thus we have before us a complete and precise scheme for regulating the issue of permits providing what matters are to be taken into consideration as relevant and prescribing appeals and revisions from subordinate bodies to higher authorities They took into consideration all the relevant matters and came to their decision which has not been attacked as partial or perverse Hence there was nothing in that report which it could be called upon to meet In our opinion there is no warrant for such a proposition The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs throughout
