At the instance of the assessee company the question was referred to <ORG> under of the Taxation on Income Investigation <ORG> Act which held that there were materials to justify the finding of the <ORG> that the purchase and sale of about lakhs odd shares was an adventure in the nature of trade Held that in considering the question whether the transac tion was or was not an adventure in the nature of trade the court had to take into consideration the intention of the assessee keeping in view the legal requirements which are associated with the concept of trade or business In the present case the transaction that consisted of buy ing the managing agency of <ORG> and the block of shares held by <ORG> was inescapably one of a commercial nature and had all the attributes of an adventure in the nature If of trade It was promoted by two groups of persons who for the sake of convenience may be called <ORG> and <ORG> They held shares out of the lacs In all shares out of the total holding of <ORG> were sold to these brokers and they in turn sold these block of shares in smaller lots to a number of purchasers When the Act came into force the case of the assessee company was referred to <ORG> by <ORG> and <ORG> made its report on November in Case No A <ORG> reformulated the question as follows Whether there were materials to justify the finding of the <ORG> that the transaction of purchase and sale of shares was an adventure in the nature of trade and answered the question so formulated in the affirmative and therefore against the assessee company The assessee company therefore took out a Notice of Motion on November which was dismissed by <ORG> on the ground that either the questions which were sought to be raised did not arise out of the finding of the <ORG> or they were included in the question which had been referred and answered by <ORG> This appeal is brought against the judgment of <ORG> answering the question referred and therefore in its advisory jurisdiction Inconsidering the question whether the transaction is or is not an adventure in the nature of trade we have to take into consideration the intention of the assessee keeping in view the legal requirements which are associated with the concept of trade or business It was argued on behalf of the assessee company that that the dominant idea with which the whole transaction was entered into was to obtain the Managing Agency of <ORG> that the assessee company was forced to buy the whole block of shares i shares by the <NAME> because they were not prepared to part with <ORG> without the whole of their stock in the mill company that as the assessee company did not not have sufficient amount of money their capital being only Rs <NAME> case but there are certain features and details which distinguish that case from the present case It was held in that case that the question had to be decided in the light of the intention of the assessee and the assessee in that case bad purchased the shares of <ORG> not as a business transaction There was no separate price paid for <ORG> and the shares purchased and <ORG> acquired were both assets of a capital nature and the shares did not constitute stock in trade of a trading venture In that case the Managing Director of the company which was formed for the purpose of carrying on general business and trade of commercial undertaking and dealing in bills hundis and other securities entered into an agreement with a sugar syndicate by which the company was to be given <ORG> of the sugar syndicate when such mill was erected in lieu of the company subscribing shares worth lacs and undertaking to sell shares worth lacs It was found as a fact that the object of the company was merely to obtain the Managing Agency of the mill which would have been an asset of an enduring nature bringing profits but there was from the very inception no intention on the part of the company to resell the shares either at profit or otherwise In that ease the court was trying to find out the intention of the assessee the company and taking all the circumstances into consideration it came to the conclusion that it was a case not of profits arising out of an adventure in the nature of trade but the intention of the assessee company was to invest its monies and therefore the excess arising out of sale of the shares was an accretion to the capital In <ORG> case the question for decision was whether of the commission earned which was paid to the two financiers was expenditure deductible under ix and it was held that it was not because the obligation to make the payment was in consideration of acquiring the Managing Agency and the right to conduct business and not for the purpose of producing profits in the conduct of business As was said by <NAME> in the above mentioned case the totality of circumstances of a case and the pros and cons have to be considered and inference drawn from those facts whether a particular transaction was in the nature of trade or was merely an investment and the resulting excess from the transaction was therefore profit which was taxable or was merely an accretion to the capital It was contended that the question should not have been reframed and we have therefore proceeded to answer the question as framed by <ORG> In our opinion the question even as framed must be answered in the affirmative Apart from the fact that the Notice of Motion was barred by time and there was no application for condonation of delay the questions which were sought to be raised were rightly held either to be covered by the question answered or they did not arise at all of the Constitution cannot be raised in these proceedings because as we have said above this <ORG> is exercising its advisory jurisdiction and its power is confined to the questions which arise in an appeal This appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs
