When an authority acts wholly without jurisdiction <ORG> should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Art Administrative Law A quasi judicial authority cannot review its own order unless power of review is expressly conferred on it by the statute under which it derives its jurisdiction The Controller passed an order allowing the appellant to function as the Principal but at the same time imposing various restraints and constraints on her powers and duties which was challenged by her in a petition filed under Art The appellant challenged the aforesaid order of the Vice Chancellor passed in review by a petition under Art When an authority has acted wholly without jurisdiction <ORG> should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Art It is now well established that a quasi judicial authority cannot review its own order unless the power of review is expressly conferred on it by the statute under which it derives its jurisdiction The special leave is granted and we proceed to dispose of the appeal on merit The appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition of the appellant on the ground of existence of an alternative remedy under section of the State Universities Act It appears that the appellant as the Principal of the Institution and the Authorised Controller could not see eye to eye with each other and there were disputes and differences between them in regard to the management of the Institution It appears that while the matter was pending before <ORG> at the instance of the appellant the Vice Chancellor passed an order dated March that is to say three days before the date of the judgment of <ORG> reviewing her earlier order disapproving the dismissal of the appellant from service By the order dated March passed on review the Vice Chancellor approved the order of the Authorised Controller dismissing the appellant from service on the basis of two reports of the Joint Director of Higher Education one dated August and the other dated July alleging great financial irregularities committed by the appellant Although the said order dated March was passed by the Vice Chancellor on review three days before the delivery of the judgment by <ORG> no steps were taken by the Authorised Controller who was a party in the writ petition to bring to the notice of <ORG> the said order of the Vice Chancellor dated March It is alleged by the appellant that the said order was passed by the Vice Chancellor in collusion with the Authorised Controller with a view to rendering the writ petition of the appellant and also the judgment of <ORG> infructuous While we reject the allegation of the appellant that the said order was passed by the Vice Chancellor in collusion with the Authorised Controller for there is no material whatsoever in support of that allegation we are of the view that the Authorised Controller should have brought to the notice of <ORG> the order of the Vice Chancellor passed on review Be that as it may the appellant again filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution of India against the said order dated March of the Vice Chancellor passed on review Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the Vice chancellor had no power of review under the Statutes of the University or under the State Universities Act and as such the Vice Chancellor acted wholly without jurisdiction in entertaining an application for review filed by the Authorised Controller Further it is submitted by the learned Counsel that the High Court was justified in not entertaining the writ petition of the appellant as there was an alternative remedy under section of the State Universities Act and the impugned order could be challenged before the Chancellor of the University on a reference of the question to the Chancellor under the provision of section It is now well established that a quasi judicial authority cannot review its own order unless the power of review is expressly conferred on it by the statute under which it derives its jurisdiction The next question that falls for our consideration is whether <ORG> was justified in dismissing the writ petition of the appellant on the ground of availability of an alternative remedy It is true that there was an alternative remedy for challenging the impugned order by referring the question to the Chancellor under section of the State Universities Act When an authority has acted wholly without jurisdiction <ORG> should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution on the ground of existence of an alternative remedy
