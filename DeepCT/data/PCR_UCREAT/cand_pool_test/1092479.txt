The other questions which arose for consideration before <ORG> in the course of the assessment are not relevant for the purpose of the present reference The assessee carried the matter in further appeal before <ORG> the <ORG> for short The <ORG> relying on a decision of the Full Bench of the <ORG> held to the effect that the condition precedent under section requires a positive act on the part of the trustees to invest the funds of the trust in certain concerns in which the persons referred to in section have substantial interest Therefore held the <ORG> assuming that the persons referred to in section have substantial interest in the companies whose shares were donated to the assessee trust the condition precedent in section was not fulfilled in the instant case It is in the background of the above facts that the following questions are referred to us for our opinion under section of the Act Whether <ORG> was right in law in holding that the condition precedent in section of the Income tax Act is not fulfilled in this case because that condition requires a positive act on the part of the trustees to invest the funds of the trust in certain concerns in which the persons referred to in section have substantial interest and because such funds were not invested in purchasing the shares which were donated to the trust Whether the burden lay on the <ORG> to show that the provisions of section of the Income tax Act applied to the case of the assessee in view of Explanation to that section Subject to the provisions of sections to the following income shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt of the income a income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes to the extent to which such income is applied to such purposes in India and where any such income is accumulated or set apart for application to such purposes in India to the extent to which the income so accumulated or set apart is not in excess of twenty five per cent Any voluntary contributions received by a trust created wholly for charitable or religious purposes or by an institution established wholly for such purposes not being contributions made with a specific direction that they shall form part of the corpus of the trust or institution shall for the purposes of section be deemed to be income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes and the provisions of that section and section shall apply accordingly Nothing contained in section or section shall operate so as to exclude from the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof in the case of a trust for charitable or religious purposes or a charitable or religious institution any income thereof i if such trust or institution has been created or established after the commencement of this Act and under the terms of the trust or the rules governing the institution any part of such income ensures or ii if any part of such income or any property of the trust or institution whenever created or established is during the previous year used or applied directly or indirectly for the benefit of any person referred to in sub section Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of clause of sub section the income or the property of the trust or institution or any part of such income or property shall for the purposes of that clause be deemed to have been used or applied for the benefit of a person referred to in sub section a if any part of the income or property of the trust or institution is or continues to be lent to any person referred to in sub section for any period during the previous year without either adequate security or adequate interest or both if any land building or other property of the trust or institution is or continues to be made available for the use of any person referred to in sub section for any period during the previous year without charging adequate rent or other compensation if any amount is paid by way of salary allowance or other wise during the previous year to any person referred to in sub section out of the resources of the trust or institution for services rendered by that person to such trust or institution and the amount so paid is in excess of what may be reasonably paid for such services if the services of the trust or institution are made available to any person referred to in sub section during the previous year without adequate remuneration or other compensation if any share security or other property is purchased by or on behalf of the trust or institution from any person referred to in subsection during the previous year for consideration which is more than adequate if any share security or other property is sold by or on behalf of the trust or institution to any person referred to in sub section during the previous year for consideration which is less than adequate if any income or property of the trust or institution is diverted during the previous year in favour of any person referred to in sub section Provided that this clause shall not apply where the income or the value of the property or as the case may be the aggregate of the income and the value of the property so diverted does not exceed one thousand rupees if any funds of the trust or institution are or continue to remain invested for any period during the previous year not being a period before the st day of January in any concern in which any person referred to in sub section has a substantial interest It is however urged on behalf of the <ORG> that the provisions of section are attracted and therefore the assessee trust is not entitled to claim exemption in respect of the dividend income of Rs The short question which arises for our consideration is whether the dividend income in respect of which the assessee trust claims exemption is includible in the assessee total income under section read with section For the purpose of resolving this controversy it was conceded by the assessee trust that the shares which were donated to it by Ms <NAME> were of concerns in which persons specified in section have substantial interest It is urged on behalf of the <ORG> that the shares which the assessee trust received as donation represented the funds of the assessee trust and since these funds of the assessee trust continued to remain invested during the previous year in the concerns in which the persons specified in sub section of section have substantial interest the dividend income derived from such shares cannot be excluded while computing the total income of the assessee trust The shares are investments in concerns covered by section and the assessee trust has continued to hold these shares during the previous year It must therefore be held that the funds of the assessee trust represented by the shares had continued to remain invested during the previous year in the concerns covered by section On the other hand it was submitted on behalf of the assessee that the shares have been received by the assessee trust as donation It was submitted that there is distinction between investment of funds of the assessee trust and holding of shares of the aforesaid concerns by the assessee trust An asset or group of assets set aside for a specific purpose A sum of money or other liquid assets set apart for a specific purpose or available for the payment of debts or claims In the plural this word has a variety of slightly different meanings as follows moneys and much more such as notes bills cheques drafts stocks and bonds and in broader meaning may include property of every kind Money in hand assets cash money available for the payment of a debt legacy etc Corporate stocks or government securities in this sense usually spoken of as the funds Assets securities bonds or revenue of a <ORG> or <ORG> appropriated for the discharge of its debts Generally working capital sometimes used to refer to cash or to cash and marketable securities An asset or group of assets within any organization separated physically or in the accounts or both from other assets and limited to specific uses Example a trust fund created by a will an endowment fund a sinking fund Current assets less current liabilities on an accrual basis working capital a term used in cash flow statements a sum of money or other resources the principal or interest of which is set apart for a specific objective to commit money in order to earn a financial return The word has a variety of meanings but the sense in which it is employed must be gathered from the context It is not a legal term with a settled meaning but it is a term in common use suggesting money in common speech although technically it may be employed to cover other articles of value for the term fund or funds is generic and all embracing as compared with the term money etc specie or a stock of convertible wealth and funds may mean or include not only money as the term is generally understood but other circulating medium or instrument or tokens in general use in the commercial world as the representatives of value such as bank notes bills cheques drafts notes stocks and bonds deposits or certificates of deposit evidences of money lent to the <ORG> constituting a national debt for which interest is paid at prescribed intervals When used in connection with the word fund in its second meaning they connote that for the purposes of the account in which the fund finds a place the payment is debited to that fund an operation which of course has no relation to the actual method of payment or the particular cash resources out of which the payment is made The expression fund or funds has a variety of meanings but the sense in which it is employed must be gathered from the context In other words we must not construe that provision mechanically We must construe it having regard to the object which the <ORG> had in view in enacting it and in the context of the setting in which it occurs On a plain reading of that provision it is clear that clause of sub section of section covers investment of the trust funds in any concern in which any of the persons specified in sub section have substantial interest specified persons in short and if such investment of the trust funds is made after December it would result in forfeiture of exemption from tax However if the trust funds have already been invested in any concern as aforesaid before January exemption would be forfeited if the funds continued to remain so invested even after December The object of the above provision is to discourage investment of trust funds in the concerns in which specified persons have substantial interest and if an investment is already made in such concerns to discourage continuance thereof after December In order to attract the provisions of section what is essential is that the funds of the trust are invested in a concern covered by section and if such investment is made prior to January funds are continued to be not invested after December It is only if the funds of the trust itself are invested that it would result in forfeiture of the exemption available under section Therefore in order to attract section it has to be established that the funds of the trust which are capable of being invested have been utilised for making investment as provided therein When the funds of the trust are so invested and such investment is continued even after December the trust whose funds are so invested will not be entitled to claim exemption under section It is therefore necessary to understand the meaning of the expression fund used in section As pointed out above one of the dictionary meanings of the expression funds is money in hand or cash The general meaning of the expression fund or funds given in Corpus Juris Secundum supra is money in common speech although technically it may be employed to cover other articles of value Funds as observed above means actual or available money or cash resources of the trust and if such funds are invested in any concern in which any of the specified person has a substantial interest or if investment out of such funds is continued in the relevant previous year section would be attracted It is only if the funds of the trust are invested and if such investment is continued that the provision of clause would be attracted Therefore in our opinion reading clause in the context of the setting in which the expression trust funds is employed and the object which the <ORG> had in view the shares held by the trust though they may be of the concerns in which any of the specified persons has a substantial interest would not be hit by that clause On a reference it was contended on behalf of the assessee that no completed gift came into being by the close of the accounting year ending on March It was in the context of this contention raised on behalf of the assessee trust that the court held that the moment the credit entries were made in the name of the trust the subject matter of the gift would be deemed to have been put in possession of the trust and the firm thenceforth would be holding the amount only as a debtor or on behalf and for the benefit of the trust No question similar to the one raised in the present reference was raised before the said court The assessee for the accounting years relevant to the assessment years to claimed exemption under section in respect of interest derived from the trust property It was urged on behalf of the assessee before <ORG> that the <ORG> has intended to apply the word fund in a restricted sense only to the accumulated income but not to the corpus and therefore the taxing authorities and the <ORG> were not right in including the aforesaid income in the assessee total income The same question which has arisen for our consideration in this reference did not arise before <ORG> The question which arose for its consideration was entirely different from the one which has arisen for our consideration in this reference Mr <NAME> had placed reliance on clause in sub section and sub section of section which were inserted by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act with effect from April in support of his contention that a wider meaning should be given to the expression funds employed in section Clause of section provides that if any funds of a charitable or religious trust or institution are invested or deposited or remain invested or deposited in any mode or form other than those specified in section at any time during any previous year commencing on or after April the income of the said trust would lose exemption from income tax It appears to us that in construing section the meaning of the expression fund will have to be determined not only with reference to dictionaries or to commercial parlance or to the principles of accountancy but also in the context of the said section itself If any other meaning is given to the expression funds the same will not be available for investment or capable of being invested The expression invest in section in our view connotes a positive act on the part of the trust whereby the funds of the trust are laid out or committed in any particular property or business or transaction with the object of earning profit or financial advantage or return It has to be established that a trust having assets in the form of money or cash or a credit balance in a bank account or in any other form capable of being invested was by a positive act and pursuant to a decision of the trust laid out or committed in a concern of a nature specified before it can be held that such an investment comes within the mischief of section In the light of the above discussion we hold that section will be attracted only in cases where funds that is moneys from actual or available money or cash resources of the trust itself are invested or continue to remain invested for any period during the previous year in any concern in which any person referred to in sub section of section has substantial interest In the view which we are taking we answer the first and third questions referred to us in the affirmative and against the <ORG>
