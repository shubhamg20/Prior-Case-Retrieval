The constitutional validity of the circular dated issued by the Secretary to <ORG> directing that for distribution of pumpsets under comprehensive coconut Development Programme and other similar schemes of <ORG> and in order to streamline the implementation of the schemes specifying specific roles and responsibilities for different agencies involved <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> would arrange supply of pump sets in the districts of Kesarkoda Kanner vyanad Koznikoda Malappuram Palekkao Trissur and Kottayam and in the remaining districts supply will be effected by private dealers along with <ORG> and <ORG> since challenged by the appellants in No of but upheld by the impugned judgment on <ORG> dated February is in question in this appeal Such writ petition was disposed by a common judgment along with other writ petitions being A Nos and of In the said other writ petitions the constitutional validity of the circular dated issued by the Registrar of <ORG> inter alia directing that all the Land Development Banks District Co operative Banks and Service Co operative Banks in the State of Kerala would patronise <ORG> to the fullest extent in preference to private dealers in the matter of purchase of Agro Machine under the scheme financed by the Bank Societies and at in any rate not less than of total requirement of such Agro Machines should be purchased through <ORG> was challenged Mr <NAME> learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted that the circular dated issued by the Secretary to <ORG> directing that in eight districts mentioned in the circular only <ORG> and <ORG> would arrange supply of pumpsets and in other parts of the State of Kerala the said <ORG> and <ORG> along with private dealers would arrange the distribution of such pumpsets under <ORG> and other similar schemes offends Articles and i of the Constitution Mr <NAME> has contended that private dealers in the State of Kerala have a fundamental right under Article of the Constitution to carry on the business or sale of pumpsets and dealership in the pumpsets without being subjected to any unreasonable restriction in such trading activities Mr <NAME> has further submitted that fundamental right guaranteed under Article may not be an absolute right and such right may be subjected to reasonable restriction but such reasonable restriction may be imposed by statutory law and regulation on cogent grounds justifying the reasonable restriction imposed with reference to the object for which reasonable restriction is imposed It has been held in the said decision that if the petitioner who has challenged the constitutional validity of the Regulation is able to establish that the impugned Regulation constitutes an infringement of any of the freedom guaranteed to him by the Constitution then the only manner in which this violation of the fundamental right can be defended is by justifying the impugned action taken by the police under the said Regulation by reference to a valid law i be it a statute a statutory law or a statutory regulation They are therefore not a law which the <ORG> is entitled to make under relevant clauses to of Article in order to regulate or curtail fundamental rights guaranteed by the several clauses under Article nor can the same be a procedure established by law and such restriction against free and uncontrolled trading activities guaranteed under Article of the Constitution is sought to be imposed not through any statute or statutory rules and regulations or by any procedure established by law but only on the basis of executive direction of <ORG> the said unreasonable restriction sought to be introduced by the said impugned circular must be held violative of Article of the Constitution are also being deprived of their unfettered right to choose the dealers of their choice of such pump sets because of the embargo on such farmers who have been given financial assistance under the schemes of <ORG> that they are to take delivery of pump sets only from two dealers namely <ORG> and <ORG> Mr <NAME> has submitted that there is no demonstrable foundation on fact that there was impelling reasons to treat the farmers of eight districts who got financial assistance under the schemes of <ORG> differently thereby compelling them to take delivery of pump sets from only two dealers Hence question of violating the fundamental right guaranteed under Article i of the Constitution does not arise Mr <NAME> has submitted that unless any action has a direct impact on the right to carry on any trade or business such action cannot be held to be violative of fundamental right guaranteed under Article i In support of such contention Mr <NAME> has referred to the decision of this Court in <ORG> versus Union of India SCR Repelling such contention it has been held by this Court that whenever the court is called upon to examine the complaint that restrictions imposed on the freedom to carry on trade are unreasonable it is necessary to find out what is the trade and business of the complainant petitioner and to what extent the restriction if any is imposed upon the freedom to carry on trade or business and then to determine whether the restriction is reasonable or not By the impugned circular <ORG> has only ensured that farmers in the said eight districts who have been given financial assistance under a scheme of the <ORG> should take delivery of pump sets from <ORG> and <ORG> Any other farmer or purchaser is quite free to choose his dealer Mr <NAME> has also submitted that there is no compulsion to any of the farmers to get covered under the scheme Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the other respondents has also supported the contentions of Mr <NAME> There was therefore a felt necessity to fix approved dealers in such ares by the <ORG> After giving our careful consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties it appears to us that the fundamental right for trading activities of the dealers in pump sets in the State of Kerala as guaranteed under Article of the Constitution has not been infringed by the impugned circular In determining the infringement of the right guaranteed under Article the nature of right alleged to have been infringed the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby the disproportion of the imposition the prevailing conditions at the time enter into judicial verdict AIR SC Laxmi versus State of AIR SC Treveli Versus State of Gujarat and Herekchand vs Union of India Under Clause of Article every citizen has a freedom and right to choose his own employment or take up any trade or calling subject only to the limits as my be imposed by the <ORG> in the interests of public welfare and the other grounds mentioned in clause of Article It may be indicated that where a right is conferred on a particular individual or group of individuals to the exclusion of others the reasonableness of restrictions has to be determined with reference to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question Canalisation of a particular business in favour of specified individual has been held reasonable by this Court where vital interests of the community are concerned or when the business affects the economy of the country Vs A AIR SC <NAME> Vs Union of India AIR SC and <NAME> Vs <ORG> and Anr SCR It is true that even for imposing reasonable restriction on the fundamental right guaranteed under Article the restriction is to be imposed under a valid law be it a statutory law or statutory regulation and not by any executive instruction of the <ORG> It may be indicated that although a citizen has a fundamental right to carry on a trade or business he has no fundamental right to insist upon the Government or any other individual for doing business with him Since the Government has every right to select dealers of its choice for delivery or pump sets at the price agreed upon and to render after sales service to the purchasers of pump sets covered by its financial assistance scheme It has also been held in that case that unless the trader or merchant is not wholly denied to carry on his trade the restriction imposed in denying the allotment of wagon in favour of such trader or merchant to transport coal for carrying put trading activities does not offend Article of the Constitution Such dealer even in the absence of the said circular cannot claim as a matter of fundamental right guaranteed under Article that a farmer or agriculturist must enter into a business deal with such trader in the matter of purchase of pump sets It has been placed on record that it was brought to the notice of the agricultural department of the State <ORG> that false invoice had been issued by dealers with out effecting actual sales with a view to draw loans subsidies and other financial benefits from the <ORG> If the State <ORG> on consideration of such facts and circumstances and to ensure genuine sale of pump sets at proper price with effective after sales service has felt that farmers covered by financial assistance scheme should be fastened with an obligation to purchase pump sets only from approved dealers in a region where according to State <ORG> there is a felt need of purchase from such approved dealers it cannot be held that such action of the State <ORG> lies in its ipsi dixit without being informed by any reason It should be borne in mind that except for the limited purpose of testing a public policy in the context of illegality and unconstitutionality court should avoid embarking on uncharted ocean of public policy In the aforesaid facts we do not find any reason to inferfere with the impugned judgment of <ORG>
