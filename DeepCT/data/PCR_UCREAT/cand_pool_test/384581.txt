According to the plaintiffs the lease expired on but as the defendants failed to vacate in spite of notices the plaintiffs filed a suit for eviction of the defendants and for arrears of rent etc The suit was resisted by the defendants appellants on various grounds The defendants admitted that according to the terms of the lease it was to expire on the th January but they pleaded that on there was a fresh agreement between the parties according to which the plaintiffs agreed that the Cinema House would be leased out for a period of years on the same terms and conditions as before except that the monthly rent would be enhanced to Rs During the pendency of the suit the defendants filed an application under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure on that the suit was compromised between the parties in and Rs On the plaintiffs filed an application under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure for a decree for eviction of the defendants from the suit premises and recovery of the arrears of rent and for mesne profits at least at the rate of Rs per mensem The application though opposed was allowed by <ORG> and a decree for eviction was passed against the defendants and also for arrears of rent at Rs Being aggrieved by this decision the defendants have come up in appeal before this Court The defendants in their written statement pleaded an agreement between the parties on according to which the plaintiffs agreed to grant the lease of the <ORG> for a further period of years on the same terms and conditions as before on an enhanced rent of Rs In the first place it was urged that the case of the defendants as pleaded in the written statement is that after the expiry of the original lease on the defendants were to continue in possession of the property as tenants holding over until the fresh lease deed was executed and that the fresh period of years was tp be computed not from the date on which the original lease expired but from the date on which the lease deed was executed We do not find any merit in this contention Even in the application for recording the compromise under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure it is stated in Clause of paragraph that the period of lease shall be years starting from th January The word otherwise in the said provision clearly indicates that it is open to the <ORG> to base the judgment on statements made by a party not only in the pleadings but also de hors the pleadings We have already discussed above that this term has according to the admissions made by the defendant himself expired and therefore the defendant is no longer entitled to continue in possession The learned counsel for the appellants however urged that if the plaintiffs have to seek a decree on the basis of a cause of action arising out of the case as set up by the defendants it would be necessary for the Plaintiffs to amend the plaint to seek the relief of eviction alternatively on the cause of action based on the defendants pleadings and in that event it would be open to the defendant to set up a defence of his choice and unless this is done the <ORG> cannot proceed to judgment under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure It is no doubt true that ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to a relief only on the basis of the cause of action stated in the plaint but it is open to the <ORG> in suitable cases to afford a relief on the basis of the case as set up by the defendant In such a case there is no prejudice to the defendant because the relief legitimately springs from the case as set UP BY him In Mandli Prasad <NAME> AIR Naa it was observed in paragraph that the following two principles are well recognized A suit must be tried in all its stages on the cause of action as it existed at the date of its commencement But if the plaintiff is entitled to the whole or potion of the relief asked for in the plaint on the basis of certain new facts stated by the defendant in the pleadings or otherwise it is open to the Court to base a judgment on such admission of the defendant even though the plaintiff has not expressly founded his cause of action on such facts by suitably amending his plaint because the defendant cannot be said to have been taken by surprise or prejudiced by giving the plaintiff a relief on the basis of his own case Defendant case Subsequently the defendant No made an application alleging that there was a compromise between the parties according to which the lease of the suit premises was to continue for a further period of two years commencing from The plaintiff then made an application without prejudice to his pleadings that he was entitled to a decree for possession under Order We agree with the view taken by this <ORG> in that case Here the defendant has taken a defence that under a compromise the term of the lease was extended by years and this term has expired We must say that the learned Judge of the lower <ORG> rightly exercised his discretion in granting a decree to the plaintiff in this case and there is no justification for interference with it We may also point out that the defendant had filed a separate suit against the plaintiff for specific performance of the alleged agreement of lease This suit has also been dismissed on the ground that the term of the lease had expired <NAME> <NAME> I agree with the judgment prepared by my learned brother and I will only add a few words of my own This letter was used as an admission under rule and as there was no substance in the plea of relief against forfeiture the suit was decreed for ejectment under that rule Sargant rejected the argument that the rule is confined to admissions made in pleadings or under Rules to in the same order same as ours and said The rule applies wherever there is a clear admission of facts in the face of which it is impossible for the party making it to succeed The written statement read in the light of the admissions in these documents leaves no manner of doubt that the fresh lease of years Pleaded by the appellants commenced from expiry of the original lease in January and expired in January and the appellants have thereafter no right whatsoever to remain in possession of the suit property In that connection the Court observed The rule undoubtedly is that the <ORG> cannot grant relief to the plaintiff on a case for which there was no foundation in the pleadings and which the other side was not called upon or had an opportunity to meet When the suit is being decreed on the basis of a case pleaded by the appellants and admissions made by them no question of surprise or prejudice to them can arise and therefore it is not necessary to insist that the plaint be amended to incorporate as an alternative case the cause of action arising from the appellants pleadings and admissions For these reasons and those given by my learned brother I agree that the appeal be dismissed with costs as proposed by him
