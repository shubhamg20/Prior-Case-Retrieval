Upon a direction having been issued by this court by an order dated September passed on the application of the applicant assessee under Section of the Income tax Act <ORG> <ORG> Jabalpur has drawn up a statement of the case and referred the following question of law arising out of the order of the said <ORG> Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the provisions of Section of the Income tax Act were applicable and the assessee could not be assessed as an association of persons and all income arising thereof upon the trust and with and subject to the powers and the provisions hereinafter declared of and concerning the same a The date of distribution means the day on which shall expire the period of years after execution of the settlement or such earlier or later day as the trustees may in their absolute discretion at any time after the execution of this settlement by deed appoint to be the date of distribution The contention of the assessee in regard to the business was that assessment should be made in the status of association of persons and that since the shares of the beneficiaries have been indicated in the trust deed the income from the trust has to be assessed in the individual hands of the beneficiaries This claim was negatived by the Income tax Officer and the appeal filed by the assessee before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was also dismissed The Appellate Assistant Commissioner was of the view that even though shares of the beneficiaries had been specifically mentioned the same were to be distributed after years from the date of creation of the trust and till that time there was no question of any distribution the income belonged to the trust only and not to the beneficiaries We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record Although the expressions were left undefined courts used to associate this class of persons with certain attributes chief amongst which was their being associated in a common endeavour for producing taxable income The only essential attributes of a body of individuals are that there should be a plurality of individuals and they must in the gross have a nexus to a source of income The individuals concerned may have something or other in common which brings them together with reference to an income or its source it may be common intention it may be common holding out or it may be a sharing of common spoils Thus the beneficiaries were not required to do anything but to stand and wait for something to fall to their respective shares in accordance with the settlement deed They were merely thus body of individuals and not an association of persons with any intention to carry on a common activity to produce taxable income An association of persons as used in Section of the Income tax Act means an association in which two or more persons join in a common purpose or common action and as the words occur in a section which imposes a tax on income the association must be one the object of which is to produce income profits or gains
