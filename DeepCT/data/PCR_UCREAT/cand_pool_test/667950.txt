Of these persons the appellant hereinafter referred to as accused and accused and are the sons of accused and accused is his wife According to the post mortem notes made by Dr <NAME> death was probably caused by the aforesaid two injuries on the neck resulting in the failure of the heart and respiration He declined to accept the prosecution story of motive on the ground that accused had earlier executed <NAME> which belied the allegation that he had insisted upon <NAME> conveying her land to him or his sons or adopting one of his sons The Trial Judge ended his judgment in the following words To summarise therefore that is a case where there does not seem to be any plausible motive for criminal behavior on the part of any of the accused and if the evidence of phuba is excluded as I have done there is no direct evidence <ORG> reached these conclusions after elaborately reappraising the entire evidence on record which on an appeal against acquittal it is well settled it could and recording correctly the principles laid down in the decisions of this Court guiding its approach in appeals against acquittal and also examined the reasons given by the Trial Judge for non acceptance of the prosecution evidence These principles are that under the CrPC <ORG> has full power to review at large the evidence upon which an order of acquittal has been passed by <ORG> and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed However in exercising that power and before reaching its conclusion upon facts <ORG> should give proper weight and consideration to such matters as the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of the appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by the judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses There is no indication in the evidence of any previous hostility between <NAME> and the accused which could impel <NAME> either to invest such evidence himself or to permit himself to be manoeuvered by any other person into investing such a story for a motive The document did not acknowledge her absolute title and her right to alienate the land during her life time or to make a bequest of it by a testamentary instrument in favour of any one It is true that there was only a solitary eye witness in the present case and that too a girl of twelve years of age to whom the Trial Judge did not consider it expedient to give the oath since according to him she was not mature enough to understand the significance of the oath At the same time there was in the circumstances of the case scarcely any possibility of there only because she had gone to the field with the deceased at the latter request to her father <NAME> for assistance But there was nothing improbable in <NAME> having done so for that was expected of her by the deceased was to pluck out from the ground groundnut creepers and collect them into heaps There was therefore nothing improbable in <NAME> being in the deceased field when the incident in question occurred Before it can be held as an omission it has to be borne in mind that according to the FIR <NAME> had been informed by <NAME> and <NAME> that his sister <NAME> was killed by her cousin father in law and husband brother and that they were about to set fire to her dead body near their residence in their field Counsel took us through the medical evidence including the post mortem notes by Dr <NAME> to show that his opinion on the two external injuries was not indefinite but was on the contrary equivocal and shaky on the question whether the injuries were ante mortem or post mortem There would therefore be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the deceased had died as a result of her having been struck with a weapon such as an axe The principle upon which this <ORG> in appeals of this type would act is that once it is found that the High <ORG> has applied the correct principles in setting aside an order of acquittal this <ORG> would not ordinarily interfere with the High <ORG> order of conviction in an appeal against acquittal or enter into the evidence to ascertain for itself whether the High <ORG> was right in its view of the evidence Only such examination of the evidence would ordinarily be necessary as needed to see that the High <ORG> approached the question properly and applied the principles correctly After having gone through that evidence we find no reason to come to the conclusion that the High <ORG> made any error in applying the principles which should guide it in an appeal against acquittal nor has any reason been established which would make us disagree with its findings on the appreciation of evidence
