This order shall also govern the disposal of Misc The present appeal is by the plaintiff against the order dated passed by <NAME> District Judge Hoshangabad in Civil Suit No A of granting a temporary injunction to the plaintiff under Order Rule of the Civil Procedure Code on certain terms The term imposed was that the plaintiff should undertake and bind itself in writing that in case it fails in the suit it will pay to the defendant for each of the two labels and one twelfth of the total net profits learned by it in its bidi business during the continuance of this injunction and for this purpose the plaintiff was The plaintiff filed the present suit alleging that the defendant firm had infringed its registered trade mark by putting in the market similar labels Besides the wrapper of the defendant labels consist of a Jhilli paper on which there are squares of green or red There is no similarity in the labels In thing so I have come to the conclusion that prima facie the label which has been put on the market is one which is likely to deceive an unwary purchaser into accepting goods of the defendant firm instead of those of the plaintiff Company I do not say that there is an attempted passing off because that would be a matter for decision in the case if the plea were raised What I have to find out is whether there is an infringement of the trade mark of the plaintiff Company sufficient to warrant me to hold that some temporary action has to be taken to safeguard an irreparable injury to the plaintiff Company I have reached precisely the same conclusions on viewing the impugned label vis a vis the label of the plaintiff Company and I think that there is a likelihood of confusion in the mind of a purchaser particularly an unlettered and ignorant villager who wants to purchase a particular soap being indifferent as to what the lettering on the label is I think that in this case there is a likelihood of injury to the plaintiff Company by reason of the sale of this imitation article and therefore it is necessary to prevent the mischief The view propounded by <NAME> was based on the principle laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> in AIR PC wherein their Lordships made the following observations Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that the finding of fraud cannot stand and that as that finding was the basis of the finding as to the possibility of confusion it is proper for their Lordships themselves to examine and consider the later question notwithstanding that there are concurrent findings below Now it must be borne in mind that the action is in substance a quia timet action as <NAME> recognised and that in the absence of evidence of actual confusion a strong case must be made to justify a conclusion that confusion will result from what the appellants are doing and that the market where alone confusion is alleged to be possible is the market whers the consumer buys Having regard to the conclusions which their Lordships have reached they think that the appeal should be allowed and the orders below should be discharged and that the action should be dismissed the appellants having their costs here and below In their Lordships view this issue raised a purely hypothetical question which the learned Judge ought not to have raised or attempted to answer There is no evidence that the defendants have made use of a mark containing the features surrounding the plaintiff portrait either without any portrait or with a portrait in no way resembling that of the plaintiff and the question whether such a mark if and when adopted by the defendants will involve infringement of the plaintiff marks does not arise Therefore it is clear that the plaintiff has certainly a vested right in the registered trade mark which means the general features of the trade mark He cannot claim that he has a vested right in any particular aspect of the trade mark Similarly he has no vested interest in the choice of colours although it is true he would certainly have a vested interest in the general get up of the trade mark and any attempt to copy the same or to put any similar labels which are likely to create confusion can be resisted by him by way of a suit for injunction It was there said at Now it is a well recognised principle that has to be taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion arising between any two trade marks that whether those two marks contain a common element which is also contained in a number of other marks in use in the same market such a common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers to pay more attention to the other features of the respective marks and to distinguish between them by those features This principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the common element shall be in fairly extensive use and as I have mentioned in use in the market in which the marks under consideration are being or will be used The series of marks containing the common element or elements therefore only assist the applicant when these narks are in extensive use in the market They are ordinary dictionary words in which no one has any right Recalling the principles on which injunctions are issued and ad interim reliefs are granted it has been observed in that case that in cases of passing off actions it is not necessary that there must be an element of fraud exercised or likely to be exercised by one party against another to justify issue of an injunction In this connection I might observe that there is practically no similarity or negligible similarity between the two bidi bundles of the appellant and the respondent Moreover there is no proof that the respondent has tried to pass off goods or that he has put in the market labels which are likely to create confusion In fact the appellant has practically no sales in the three districts of Hoshangabad East Nimar and Dewas while the respondent business is centered in those three districts This is also one of the reasons why there is no likelihood of any confusion being created or any attempt at passing off succeeding on account of the mere fact that the respondent has put in the market a label which also has the picture of a cow But there is no attempt at causing confusion or at passing off the respondent goods for the appellant goods Applying the tests laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> as also by their Lordships of <ORG> and of the learned Judges of this Court in the cases mentioned above I am of opinion that the grant of a temporary injunction in the present case by the learned trial Judge was not in accordance with law nor in consonance with judicial principles As already indicated earlier the respondent business is centered in three districts of Madhya Pradesh where the appellant has practically no sales It is for this reason as well that I am of opinion that the grant of an injunction would be improper as it Would not be necessary in order to prevent any irreparable injury to the appellant but on the other hand it will definitely cause irreparable injury to the respondent which cannot be off set by a pecuniary compensation
