This appeal arises out of an application made under the Trade Marks Act hereinafter called the Act for registration of a trade mark The application was made by the respondent and it was opposed by the appellant On November it made the application for registration of the mark Gluvita in respect of the goods specified in class which mark it appeared later it had not used prior to that date The appellant opposed the respondent application contending that it should be refused under ss a and of the Act to which opposition the respondent duly filed a counter statement He further held that the words Glucovita and Gluvita were not visually or phonetically similar and that there was no reasonable likelihood of any deception being caused by or any confusion arising from the use of the respondent proposed mark The appellant then preferred an appeal to <ORG> from the order of the Deputy Registrar It was not seriously pressed before him on behalf of the appellant that the goods were of the same description and he himself also came to the conclusion that they were not so He therefore set aside the order of the Deputy Registrar and held that the respondent mark could not be registered in view of a The learned Judges of the appellate bench took the view that there was no evidence that the appellant mark had acquired any reputation among the public but that the evidence produced showed that it had acquired a reputation among the trades people only who were discerning and were not likely to be deceived or confused They also held that the evidence established that there were a series of marks in which the prefix or suffix Gluco or Vita occurred and that it could not therefore be said that the common features Gluco and Vita were only associated with the manufacture of the appellant goods In the result they set aside the order of <NAME> <NAME> and restored that of the Deputy Registrar In order that might apply to the case the appellant had to establish that its mark had been registered in respect of the same goods or description of goods for which the respondent had made its application for registration Before the appellate Judges of <ORG> the appellant proceeded on the basis that the goods were not of the same description We are thus left only with the question whether a prevents the registration of the respondent mark In our judgment the view of the appellate Judges of <ORG> that there was no evidence that the appellant trade mark had acquired a reputation among the public cannot be sustained But apart from this there is other evidence on the record to support the conclusion that the appellant mark had acquired a reputation among the public There is no clear denial of this in the counter statement filed by the respondent There is further ample evidence to show that the appellant goods under its mark Glucovita were sold in very large quantities in small containers of one pound and four ounces capacities But the most conclusive evidence of the sale of the appellant goods under the mark Glucovita to the general public comes from the affidavits filed by the respondents itself From the affidavit of <NAME> a partner in a firm of <ORG> filed by the respondent it appears that a number of customers come to buy the products Gluvita and the products Glucovita On those affidavits there is not even a suggestion that the public wanted the Glucovita powder mixed with vitamins manufactured by the respondent and not by anybody else It seems clear to us that what is necessary is that the reputation should attach to the trade mark it should appear that the public associated that trade mark with certain goods In our view therefore it would be wrong in this case to say that the appellant trade mark had not acquired any reputation among the general public and that hence there is no reasonable apprehension of their being confused or deceived by the use of the respondent proposed mark The second point on which the learned appellate Judges based themselves in arriving at the conclusion that there was no reasonable apprehension of confusion or deception was as we have earlier stated that there were various trade marks with a prefix or suffix Gluco or Vita and that made it impossible to say that the common features Glu and Vita were only associated with the appellant products That passage may be summarised thus Where there are a series of marks registered or unregistered having a common feature or a common syllable if the marks in the series are owned by different persons this tends to assist the applicant for mark containing the common feature In short when the Registrar comes to compare the applicant mark with the registered marks using the principles laid down in the Pionotist case the presence of marks on the Register other than the one with which the comparison is being made is regarded an one of the surrounding circumstances which he is required to take into account But when the same question comes before the Registrar in opposition proceedings it appears to me that he is no longer in a position to make any presumption as regards the surrounding circumstances but that before he can draw the suggested inference based upon the user of other marks either in the applicant or the opponent favour any such user must be established by evidence see Harrods Ld We have no reason to think that <NAME> in stating the law on the subject intended to depart from the principle stated in the passage that we have just now read from <NAME> Kollar Co case Now it is a well recognised principle that has to be taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion arising between any two trademarks that where those two marks contain a common element which is also contained in a number of other marks in use in the same market such a common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers to pay more attention to the other features of the respective marks and to distinguish between them by those features This principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the common element shall be in fairly extensive use and as I have mentioned in use in the market in which the marks under consideration are being or will be used The series of marks containing the common element or elements therefore only assist the applicant when those marks are in extensive use in the market They are ordinary dictionary words in which no one has any right On this matter we have not the advantage of the view of the learned appellate Judges of <ORG> He thought that the test down in what is called the <NAME> case In re an application by <ORG> should be applied and that the emphatic characteristic of the second syllable in the mark Glucovita should decide that there was no likelihood of confusion arising It is for the court to decide that question Again in deciding the question of similarity between the two marks we have to approach it from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection It was then said that the goods were not of the same description and that therefore in spite of the similarity of the two marks there would be no risk of confusion or deception It is true that we have to proceed on the basis that the goods are not of the same description for the purposes of of the Act But there is evidence that glucose is used in the manufacture of biscuits This was the kind of trade connection between different goods which in the Black Magic case In re an application by <NAME> was taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion that there was likelihood of confusion or deception But that in our opinion makes no difference There is no reason why the test of trade connection between different goods should not apply where the competing marks closely resemble each other just as much as it applies as held in the Black Magic and Panda cases where the competing marks were identical Whether by applying these tests in a particular case the conclusion that there is likelihood of deception or confusion should be arrived at would depend on all the facts of the case But there is nothing to show that an average buyer knows with what kind of glucose biscuits containing glucose are or can be made In the result we set aside the order of the learned appellate Judges of <ORG> and restore that of <NAME> The appeal is accordingly allowed The appellant will get the costs before the appellate Judges in <ORG> and in this <ORG>
