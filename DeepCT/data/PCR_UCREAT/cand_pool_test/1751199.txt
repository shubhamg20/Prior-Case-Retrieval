HEADNOTE In a complaint filed before the Judicial Magistrate the appellant bride father alleged that during the marriage ceremonies the first respondent bride groom father had demanded a large sum of money to be paid to him as dowry and threatened that if the appellant did not pay the sum he would stop further marriage ceremonies that even after his daughter After verifying the complaint the Judicial Magistrate issued processes to the respondents and sent summons is to the United States where the respondents were Allowing the respondent application impugning the order of the Magistrate issuing summonses the <ORG> held that since there was no allegation in the complaint that the respondents first demanded the dowry and the appellant had agreed to pay it and the respondents thereafter demanded it again no offence under section was made out In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that a mere demand for dowry even if there was no consent to comply with that demand would constitute an offence under section of the Act If the literal meaning of these words is given to the words bride and bridegroom used in the section any property or valuable security demanded and contented to be given before the woman had become a bride or the man had become a bridegroom may not be dowry There is therefore no warrant for the respondents contention that initial demand for dowry would not constitute an offence but that it would be an offence only when the demand was made again after the party on whom it was made had agreed to comply with it The inherent power of the <ORG> must be exercised sparingly and with circumspection when there is reason to believe that the process of law is being misused to harass a citizen The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VARADARAJAN This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> in Criminal Application No of quashing the proceedings in Criminal Case No of on the file of the Judicial Magistrate First Class Anti Corruption Pune The application in <ORG> was filed by the respondents in this appeal who are the two accused in that criminal case for quashing the criminal proceedings as well as the order of the Judicial Magistrate issuing processes against them in that case Reading the definition of dowry given in of the Act into the learned judges held that for bringing a case under of the Act there must be a demand for dowry as such that is for any property agreed to be given as consideration for the marriage and that as there is no allegation in the complaint that the appellant had agreed to pay the sum of Rs The question for consideration is whether the allegation made in the appellant complaint that there was a demand by the respondents when the ceremonies of the marriage of <NAME> with the second respondent were in progress for the payment of Rs In this Act dowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly a by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person to either party to the marriage or to any other person at or before or after the marriage as consideration for the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law Shariat applies Explanation II The expression valuable security has the same meaning as in section of the Indian Penal Code If any person after the commencement of this Act gives or takes or abets the giving or taking of dowry he shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or with both If any person after the commencement of this Act demands directly or indirectly from the parents or guardian of a bride or bridegroom as the case may be any dowry he shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six moths or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or with both Provided that no court shall take cognizance of any offence under this section except with the previous sanction of <ORG> or of such officer as <ORG> may by general or special order specify in this behalf It is further alleged that some respectable persons who were present at that time persuaded the respondents to complete the marriage ceremonies and formalities and thereafter the marriage ceremonies were completed and that subsequently the second respondent went to the United States in July alone because the passport and visa of <NAME> had to be arranged which was done some time later while <NAME> was staying in the house of the first respondent and the respondents continued to persist in their demand for the money when <NAME> was saying in the house of the first respondent without being sent to the United States We think that the learned judge is right in holding so and that it is desirable that even such a demand should be prohibited and made punishable in law under the pretext that it was required for the passage of the parties to the marriage to the United States with a threat that if the amount was not paid the marriage ceremonies would not be completed and that there was demand for payment of the amount even after the marriage ceremonies were over when <NAME> was staying in the house of the first respondent after the second respondent went away alone to the United States because the passport and visa for <NAME> had not been obtained by then What appeared from the record of the case out of which the decision of <ORG> arose was that the accused petitioner filed an application on raising a contention that <ORG> Dadar Bombay had no jurisdiction to entertain and try the case because the accused and the complainant were residing outside the jurisdiction of that Court However during the arguments in <ORG> it was conceded by the learned counsel for the accused petitioner that the complaint was filed within the period prescribed Therefore the only question that arose for consideration by the learned Judges of <ORG> was the one relating to the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Magistrate Dadar Bombay to entertain and inquire into the complaint The learned Judges have further observed thus On the averments made in the complaint the demand is made by the accused by writing a letter from Wadala Bombay It is further alleged by the complainant in the complaint that the marriage of <NAME> which was almost settled could not take place due to the demand of dowry made by the accused Hence there is no substance in this contention It appears from a reading of this judgment that it was either not disputed before the learned Judges or that it was presumed that a mere demand for property as consideration for the marriage taking place would constitute an offence under of the Act No doubt according to of the Act dowry is any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or after the marriage as consideration for the marriage but does not include dowar or mahr in the case of person to whom the Muslim Personal Law Shariat appear applies But having regard to the dominant object of the Act which is to stemp out the practice of demanding dowry in any shape or form either before or after the marriage we are of the opinion that the entire definition of word dowry should not be imported into which lays down that if any person after the commencement of this Act demands directly or indirectly from the parents or guardian of a bride or bridegroom as the case may be any dowry he shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or with both If we give this strict meaning of a bride or a bridegroom to the word bride or bridegroom used in of the Act property or valuable security demanded and consented to be given prior to the time when the woman had become a bride or the man had become a bridegroom may not be dowry within the meaning of the Act We are of the opinion that having regard to the object of the Act a liberal construction has to be given to the word dowry used in of the Act to mean that any property or valuable security which if consented to be given on the demand being made would become dowry within the meaning of of the Act There is no warrant for taking the view that the initial demand for giving of property or valuable security would not constitute an offence and that an offence would take place only when the demand was made again after the party on whom the demand was made agreed to comply with it <ORG> we cannot refrain from observing might well have refused to invoke its inherent powers at the very threshold in order to quash the proceedings for these powers are meant to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection when there is reason to believe that the process of law is being misused to harass a citizen Mr <NAME> who appeared for the second respondent State of Maharashtra was not in a position to tell us about what the exact stand of <ORG> in this appeal is as to whether it supports or opposes the contention of the appellant that the allegation made in the complaint constitutes an offence under of the Act For the reasons stated above we allow the appeal and direct the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class to take further proceedings on the complaint and dispose of the case according to law
