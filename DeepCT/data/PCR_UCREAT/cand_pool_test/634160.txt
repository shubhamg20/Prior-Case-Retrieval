As per Regulation the compulsory subjects carry in the aggregate marks and there is also viva voce examination which is compulsory and which carries marks and each optional subject carries marks They filed several writ petitions in the <ORG> of Punjab and Haryana challenging the validity of the selection of the appellants and seeking a writ for quashing and setting aside the same This infirmity had the effect of invaliding the selection made by Haryana <ORG> that the allocation of marks for the viva voce test out of a total of marks for the generality of students and a total of marks for ex servicemen was arbitrary and excessive and it had the effect of distorting the entire process of selection and it was accordingly unconstitutional as involving denial of equal opportunity in public employment and that the viva voce test was not conducted fairly and honestly and the selections made were vitiated on account of nepotism favouritism and casteism and also political motivation The appellants however submitted that the challenge to the validity of selections was unfounded on the grounds i that not only was it not competent to the <ORG> on the existing set of pleadings to examine whether the Chairman and members of the Haryana <ORG> were men of high integrity calibre and qualification but also there was no material at all on the basis of which the <ORG> could possibly come to the conclusion that they were men lacking integrity calibre or qualification ii that the Haryana public Service <ORG> being a constitutional authority it was not necessary for Sh This was in conformity with the principles of fair play and did not affect the validity of the selections iii that under Regulation in Appendix I the Haryana <ORG> was justified in calling for interview all the and odd candidates who qualified by getting more than marks iv that the allocation of marks for the viva voce test was made under the Punjab Civil Service Executive Branch Rules and it had stood the test of time and could not possibly be regarded as arbitrary or excessive and that the selections were made fairly and honestly and they were not tainted by nepotism favouritism casteism or political patronage besides there was nothing to show that any extraneous considerations had influenced the selection process Moreover these observations against the Chairman and members of the Haryana <ORG> were made without any factual basis on the pleadings or the evidence A ii It is difficult to see how on the basis of a mere averment in paragraph of one of the writ petitions which averment was disputed on behalf of the respondents <ORG> of the <ORG> could possibly come to the conclusion that politics had played a major role in appointment of the Chairman and members of the Haryana <ORG> and that they were men lacking in integrity calibre and qualification particularly when no such allegation was made by the petitioners in any of the other writ petitions Therefore <ORG> of the <ORG> was not at all justified in drawing from the facts set out in paragraph of Civil writ Petition No of any inference that the Chairman and members were totally unfit to be appointed on the Haryana <ORG> or that they were not men of integrity calibre and qualification i There was no material whatsoever on record to justify the observations made by <ORG> that high marks were undeservedly given to the three candidates related to Shri <NAME> and Shri <NAME> and low marks were deliberately given to the other meritorious candidates with a view to manipulating the selection of the former at the cost of the latter In fact far from there being any material supportive of such observation there is one circumstance which completely militates against the view taken by <ORG> and that circumstance is that the marks obtained by the candidates at the written examination were not disclosed to the members of the Haryana <ORG> who held the viva voce examination ii It is one of the fundamental principles of jurisprudence that no man can be a judge in his own cause and that if there is a reasonable likelihood of bias it is in accordance with natural justice and common sense that the justice likely to be so biased should be incapacitated from sitting The question is not whether the judge is actually biased or in fact decides partially but whether there is a real likelihood of bias What is objectionable in such a case is not that the decision is actually tainted with bias but that the circumstances are such as to create a reasonable apprehension in the mind of others that there is a likelihood of bias affecting the decision It is appropriately extended to all cases where an independent mind has to be applied to arrive at a fair and just decision between the rival claims of parties The strict standards applied to authorities exercising judicial power are being increasingly applied to administrative bodies for it is vital to the maintenance of the rule of law in a welfare state where the jurisdiction of administrative bodies is increasing at a rapid pace that the instrumentalities of the <ORG> should discharge their functions in a fair and just manner Where reasonable likelihood of bias is alleged on the ground of relationship the question would always be as to how close is the degree of relationship or in other words is the nearness of relationship so great as to give rise to reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the authority making the selection iii The principle which requires that a member of <ORG> whose close relative is appearing for selection should decline to become a member of the selection committee or withdraw from it leaving it to the appointing authority to nominate another person in his place need not be applied in case of a constitutional <ORG> like the <ORG> whether <ORG> or <ORG> Of course it must be made clear that when a close relative of a member of a <ORG> is appearing for interview such member must withdraw from participation in the interview of that candidate and must not take part in any discussion in regard to the merits of that candidate and even the marks or credits given to that candidate should not be disclosed to him There was no infirmity attaching to the selections made by the Haryana <ORG> on the ground that though their close relative were appearing for the interview Shri <NAME> and Shri <NAME> did not withdraw completely from the entire selection process i The Haryana <ORG> was not right in calling for interview all the and odd candidates who secured per cent or more marks in the written examination There is no obligation on the Haryana public Service <ORG> to call for the viva voce test all candidates who satisfy the minimum eligibility requirement Where there is a composite test consisting of a written examination followed by a viva voce test the number of candidates to be called for interview in order of the marks obtained in the written examination should not exceed twice or at the highest thrice the number of vacancies to be filled In the instant case the Haryana <ORG> could not be said to be actuated by any malafide or oblique motive in calling for interview all the candidates because it was common ground between the parties that this was the practice which was being consistently followed by the Haryana <ORG> over the years and what was done in this case was nothing exceptional Therefore the selections made by the Haryana <ORG> could not be said to be vitiated merely on the ground that as many as and more candidates representing more than times the number of available vacancies were called for interview though it is not right course to follow and not more than twice or at the highest thrice the number of candidates should have been called for interview There were of course general allegations of casteism made against the Chairman and the members of the Haryana <ORG> but these allegations were not substantiated by producing any reliable material before the <ORG> While a written examination has certain distinct advantages over the viva voce test there are yet no written tests which can evaluate a candidate initiative alertness resourcefulness dependableness cooperativeness capacity for clear and logical presentation effectiveness in discussion effectiveness in meeting and dealing with others adaptability judgment ability to make decision ability to lead intellectual and moral integrity ii There cannot be any hard and fast rule regarding the precise weight to be given to the viva voce test as against the written examination Whatever selections are made by the Haryana <ORG> in the future shall be on the basis that the marks allocated for the viva voce test shall not exceed in case of candidates belonging to the general category and in case of ex service officers The <ORG> directed that when selections to <ORG> are being made in a <ORG> a sitting Judge of the <ORG> to be nominated by the Chief Justice of the <ORG> should be invited to participate in the interview as an expert who by reason of the fact that he is a sitting <ORG> Judge knows the quality and character of the candidates appearing for the interview and the advice given by him should ordinarily be accepted unless there are strong and cogent reasons for not accepting such advice and such strong and cogent reasons must be recorded in writing by the Chairman and members of the <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> These appeals by special leave are directed against a judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> quashing and setting aside certain selections made by <ORG> to <ORG> Executive and other allied services The judgment in part proceeds on surmises and conjectures and has made certain uncharitable observations against the Chairman and Members of <ORG> without any warrant and hence it is necessary to set out the facts giving rise to the appeals in some detail Rule clause of these Rules provided that a competitive examination shall be held at any place in Haryana in each year in or about the month of January for the purpose of selection by competition of as many candidates for <ORG> Executive and others allied services as the Governor of Haryana may determine and such competitive examination shall be held in accordance with the Regulations contained in Appendix I to the Rules Rule laid down the conditions for eligibility to appear at the competitive examination but we are not concerned with these conditions of eligibility in the present appeals The compulsory subjects included English Essay Hindi Essay and General knowledge carrying in the aggregate marks and there was also viva voce examination which was compulsory and which carried marks and each optional subject carried marks It seems that there were some candidates who had obtained very high marks at the written examination but owing to rather poor marks obtained by them in the viva voce test they could not come within the first candidates and they were consequently not selected They also claimed that the marks given in the viva voce test should be ignored and selections should be made only on the basis of the marks obtained by the candidates at the written examination and they contended that if that was done they would be within first to be selected by <ORG> Since all the writ petitions raised substantially the same issues and the pleadings in the writ petitions also followed substantially the same pattern one writ petition namely Civil Writ Petition of was treated as the main writ petition and the principal arguments were advanced in that writ petition It would therefore be convenient to refer only to Civil Writ Petition of and trace the course followed by it in <ORG> because whatever we say in regard to this writ petition would apply equally to the other writ petitions We do not propose to set out here at this stage the averments made in the writ petition or the answer to those averments made on behalf of the respondents because we shall have to refer to them in some detail when we deal with the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties We may briefly set out the grounds on which the petitioners challenged the validity of the selections made by <ORG> There were several grounds on which the validity of the selections made by <ORG> was assailed on behalf of the petitioners and a declaration was sought that they were entitled to be selected as falling within the first candidates Secondly it was urged on behalf of the petitioners that two of the selected candidates namely Mrs <NAME> and <NAME> were related to one of the members of <ORG> namely <NAME> while the third selected candidate namely <NAME> was related to another member namely <NAME> and though these two members did not participate in the interview of their respective relatives they did participate in the interview of other candidates and the tactics adopted by the Chairman and the members of the <ORG> was to give high marks to the relatives and award low marks to the other candidates so as to ensure the selection of their relatives The number of candidates called for interview was almost times the number of vacancies and this not only imposed an intolerable burden on <ORG> but also widened the scope for arbitrariness in selection by making it possible for <ORG> to boost up or deflate the total marks which might be obtained by a candidate The argument of the petitioners was that the number of candidates to be called for interview should not exceed twice or at the highest thrice the number of vacancies because otherwise the objective test of written examination would be considerably diluted by the subjective assessment made in the vive voce test and there would be considerable scope for arbitrariness in the process of selection The fourth contention urged on behalf of the petitioners was that the allocation of marks for the viva voce test out of a total of marks for the generality of students and a total of marks for ex servicemen was arbitrary and excessive and it had the effect of distorting the entire process of selection by introducting in a preponderant measure subjective element which could facilitate arbitrariness and manipulation and it was accordingly unconstitutional as involving denial of equal opportunity in public employment Lastly it was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the viva voce test was not conducted fairly and honestly and the selections made were vitiated on account of nepotism favouritism and casteism and also political motivation These ground of challenge were sought to be repelled on behalf of the respondents and it was contended that not only was it not competent to the court on the existing set of pleadings to examine whether the Chairman and members of <ORG> were men of high integrity calibre and qualification but also there was no material at all on the basis of which the Court could possibly come to the conclusion that they were men lacking in integrity calibre or qualification It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that <ORG> being a constitutional authority it was not necessary for Sh<NAME> and <NAME> to withdraw altogether from the interviews and they acted correctly in abstaining from participation when their relatives came to be interviewed So far as the allocation of marks for the viva voce test is concerned it was contended that this allocation of marks for the viva voce test was made under the Punjab Civil Service Executive Branch Rules which had been in force since over years and no one had raised any objection to it during this long period of half a century and it had stood the test of time and could not possibly be regarded as arbitrary or excessive The allegation that the selections were not made fairly and honestly and they were tainted by nepotism favouritism casteism or political patronage was vehemently denied on behalf of the respondents and it was contended that there was nothing to show that any extraneous considerations had influenced the selection process <ORG> almost seemed to suggest without there being the slightest warrant for it that it was a familiar and deliberate tactic adopted by the members of the <ORG> to abstain from participating in the interview of their close relatives which in effect made patent to the remaining members about their deep interest in them and further that each member of the <ORG> adjusted the relatives of the other and awarded low marks in interview to other candidates who had secured high marks in the written examination in order to oust the latter and bolster up the former in the merit list The view taken by <ORG> was that the number of candidates to be called for interview should not exceed twice or at the highest thrice the number of vacancies required to be filled up Since disparaging observations were made against the Chairman and members of <ORG> by <ORG> in its judgment three members of <ORG> who were impleaded as respondents No and in the writ petitions also applied for special leave to appeal and on such leave being obtained preferred Civil Appeal No of All these three appeals were heard together since they were directed against the same judgment of <ORG> and we proceed to dispose them of by this common judgment The first question that arises for consideration in these appeals is whether <ORG> of <ORG> was right in condemning the Chairman and members of <ORG> as men lacking in integrity calibre and qualification and alleging corrupt motives against them Secondly these observations against the Chairman and members of <ORG> were made without any factual basis in the pleadings or the evidence There were no averments made in any of the writ petitions save and except Civil Writ petition No of regarding the Chairman or any of the members of <ORG> The relationship alleged in paragraph was not disputed on behalf of the respondents but the inference sought to be drawn there from was stoutly resisted and it was contended that there was no material at all on the basis of which it could be said that the Chairman and members of <ORG> were appointed solely due to political and caste considerations without taking into account calibre competence or integrity Now it is difficult to see how on the basis of a mere averment in paragraph of one of the writ petitions which averment was disputed on behalf of the respondents <ORG> of <ORG> could possibly come to the conclusion that politics had played a major role in appointment of the Chairman and members of <ORG> and that they were men lacking in integrity calibre and qualification particularly when no such allegation was made by the petitioners in any of the other writ petitions We do not think that <ORG> of <ORG> was at all justified in drawing from the facts set out in paragraph of Civil Writ petition No of any inference that the Chairman and members were totally unfit to be appointed on <ORG> or that they were not men of integrity calibre and qualification Article of the Constitution makes provision for appointment and term of office of members of <ORG> Clause of Article declares that a member of <ORG> shall hold office for a term of six years from the date on which he enters upon his office or until he attains the age of sixty two years which ever is earlier If that be so it passes our comprehension as to how the appointments of the Chairman and members of <ORG> could be regarded as suffering from any infirmity or any selections made by them could be said to be vitiated merely on the ground that they were not in the opinion of <ORG> of <ORG> possessed of integrity calibre or qualification Suppose a District Judge is appointed by the Governor of the State in consultation with <ORG> in accordance with the requirements of Article and the appropriate rules made in that behalf Can a judgment delivered by him be assailed as invalid on the ground that he has not the requisite integrity calibre or qualification The judgment may be set aside if it is wrong but not because it is given by a Judge who is lacking in integrity calibre or qualification Lastly we do not think that <ORG> of <ORG> was justified in going into the question whether the Chairman and members of <ORG> were appointed an account of caste considerations and political patronage or were lacking in integrity calibre or qualification when the validity of their appointments was not challenged in the writ petitions nor was any relief claimed for setting aside their appointments This view receives support from the observations of <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> in <NAME> State of Andhra Pradesh There the learned Judge pointed out The defective appointment of a de facto judge may be questioned directly a proceeding to which he be a party but it cannot be permitted to be questioned in a litigation between two private litigants a litigation which is of no concern or consequence to the judge except as a judge That takes us to the next ground of attack which found favour with <ORG> of <ORG> namely that the participation of <NAME> and <NAME> in the process of selection introduced a serious infirmity in the selections It was not disputed and indeed on the record it could not be than when the close relatives of <NAME> and <NAME> came up for interview but according to <ORG> of <ORG> such limited withdrawal from participation was not enough and both the members said <ORG> ought to have withdrawn from the selection process altogether There is nothing to show that these three candidates who happened to be related to <NAME> and <NAME> were not possessed of any requisite calibre or competence or their performance at the viva voce examination did not justify the marks awarded to them There is nothing more sacred than the public interest and the public interest demands that the functioning of the <ORG> should be widely debated through the press and other forums The very fact that Shri <NAME> not only did not register any dissent in regard to the marks awarded at the viva voce examination but actually agreed with the evaluation made by his colleagues shows that there was nothing wrong with the marking nor was there any manipulation of marks indicating nepotism or favouritism In fact Shri <NAME> filed an affidavit in these proceedings where he candidly said that this article written by him was based on his direct experience of working in <ORG> and he proceeded to add boldly and courageously As a member of <ORG> I noticed various forces trying to undermine the independent functioning of the <ORG> But at the same time it served the purpose I had in mind There is no reason why this statement made by Shri <NAME> <NAME> should not be believed We accept what has been stated by Shri <NAME> in his affidavit and disapprove of the observation made by <ORG> that high marks were undeservedly given to the three candidates related to <NAME> and <NAME> and low marks were deliberately given to the meritorious candidates with a view to manipulating the selection of the former at the cost of the latter We are of the view that there was no material whatsoever on record to justify such observation on the part of <ORG> We find that there is one circumstance which in our opinion completely militates against the view taken by <ORG> and that circumstance is that the marks obtained by the candidates at the written examination were not disclosed to the members of <ORG> who held the viva voce examination But according to the petitioners this was not sufficient to wipe out the blemish in the process of selection for two reasons firstly because <NAME> and <NAME> participated in the interviews of the other candidates and that gave rise to a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the candidates that <NAME> and <NAME> might tend to depress the marks of the other candidates with a view to ensuring the selection of the candidates related to them and secondly because there could be reasonable apprehension in the mind of the candidates that the other members of <ORG> interviewing the candidates might out of regard for their colleagues tend to give higher marks to the candidates related to them The argument of the petitioners was that the presence of <NAME> and <NAME> on the interviewing committee gave rise to an impression that there was reasonable likelihood of bias in favour of the three candidates related to <NAME> and <NAME> and this had the effect of vitiating the entire selection process We agree with the petitioners that it is one of the fundamental principles of our jurisprudence that no man can be a Judge in his own cause and that if there is a reasonable likelihood of bias it is in accordance with natural justice and common sense that the justice likely to be so biased should be incapacitated from sitting The question is not whether the judge is actually biased or in fact decides partially but whether there is a real likelihood of bias What is objectionable in such a case is not that the decision is actually tainted with bias but that the circumstances are such as to create a reasonable apprehension in the mind of others that there is a likelihood of bias affecting the decision It is appropriately extended to all cases where an independent mind has to be applied to arrive at a fair and just decision between the rival claims of parties The strict standards applied to authorities exercising judicial power are being increasingly applied to administrative bodies for it is vital to the maintenance of the rule of law in a welfare state where the jurisdiction of administrative bodies in increasing at a rapid pace that the instrumentalities of the <ORG> should discharge their functions in a fair and just manner This <ORG> held that the presence of <NAME> vitiated the selection on the ground that there was reasonable likelihood of bias affecting the process of selection At every stage of his participation in the deliberation of the selection board there was a conflict between his interest and duty Therefore what we have to see is whether there is reasonable ground for believing that he was likely to have been biased There must be a reasonable likelihood of bias In deciding the question of bias we have to take into consideration human probabilities and ordinary course of human conduct This Court emphasised that it was not necessary to establishes as but it was sufficient to invalidate the selection process if it could be shown that there was reasonable likelihood of bias Where reasonable likelihood of basis is alleged on the ground of relationship the question would always be as to how close is the degree of relationship or in other words is the nearness of relationship so great as to give rise to reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the authority making the selection <ORG> observed that the degree of relationship in this case was so close as to reasonably give an impression to the other candidates that there was a real likelihood of the son in law espousing the cause of his father in law as his own The same approach was adopted by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra where one of the members of <ORG> who sat on the <ORG> and participated in the selection for the posts of Professor and Lecturer in <ORG> was a partner with some of the candidates appearing for the selection and it was held that the entire selection process was vitiated because there was clearly reasonable likelihood of bias in favour of those candidates on the part of such member of the <ORG> We would not like to whittle down in the slightest measure the vital principle laid down in this decision which has nourished the roots of the rule of law and injected justice and fair play into legality We do not think that the principle which requires that a member of <ORG> whose close relative is appearing for selection should decline to become a member of the selection committee or withdraw from it leaving it to the appointing authority to nominate another person in his place need be applied in case of <ORG> like <ORG> whether <ORG> or <ORG> <NAME> observed to the same effect in <NAME> <ORG> of and while dealing with a similar question which arose before him for consideration The procedure adopted by <ORG> and the member concerned was in accord with the quite well known and generally accepted procedure adopted by <ORG> everywhere There was no occasion to suspect his bona fides even remotely There was no violation of the principles of natural justice We are therefore of the view that there was no infirmity attaching to the selections made by <ORG> on the ground that though their close relative were appearing for the interview <NAME> and <NAME> did not withdraw completely from the entire selection process This ground urged on behalf of the petitioners must therefore be rejected There was also one other contention which found favour with <ORG> in support of its conclusion that there was reasonable likelihood of bias vitiating the whole gamut of the selection process <ORG> pointed out that in order to have a proper balance between the objective assessment of a written examination and the subjective assessment of personality by a viva voce test the candidates to be called for interview at the viva voce test should not exceed twice or at the highest thrice the number of available vacancies This practice of confining the number of candidates to be called for interview to twice or at the highest thrice the number of vacancies to be filled up was being followed consistently by <ORG> in case of Civil Services Examination but in the present case observed <ORG> a departure was made by <ORG> and candidates numbering more than times the available vacancies were called for interview On the basis of these facts and circumstances <ORG> concluded that the petitioners had discharged the burden of showing that there was reasonable likelihood of bias vitiating the entire selection process We do not think we can agree with this conclusion reached by <ORG> But whilst disagreeing with the conclusion we must admit that <ORG> was not right in calling for interview all the and odd candidates who secure per cent or more marks in the written examination We have already referred to Regulation in an earlier part of the judgment and we need not reproduce it again There is no obligation on <ORG> to call for the viva test all candidates who satisfy the minimum eligibility requirement Only to candidates are called for interview in a day of hours We are therefore of the view that where there is a composite test consisting of a written examination followed by a viva voce test the number of candidates to be called for interview in order of the marks obtained in the written examination should not exceed twice or at the highest thrice the number of vacancies to be filled <ORG> in the present case called for interview all candidates numbering over who satisfied the minimum eligibility requirement by securing a minimum of per cent marks in the written examination and this was certainly not right but we may point out that in doing so <ORG> could not be said to be actuated by any malafide or oblique motive because it was common ground between the parties that this was the practice which was being consistently followed by <ORG> over the years and what was done in this case was nothing exceptional We do not think that the selections made by <ORG> could be said to be vitiated merely on the ground that as many as and more candidates representing more than times the number of available vacancies were called for interview though on the view taken by us that was not the right course to follow and not more than twice or at the highest thrice the number of candidates should have been called for interview That is why <ORG> relied on the comparative figures of marks obtained in the written examination and at the viva voce test by the petitioners the first candidates who topped the list in the written examination and the first candidates who topped the list on the basis of the combined marks obtained in the written examination and the viva voce test and observed that these figures showed that there was reasonable likelihood of arbitrariness and bias having operated in the marking at the viva voce test There were of course general allegations of casteism made against the Chairman and the members of <ORG> but these allegations were not substantiated by producing any reliable material before the <ORG> That takes us to the next ground of challenge which found acceptance with <ORG> It is necessary in order to appreciate this contention and to adjudicate upon its validity to consider the relative weight attached by the relevant rules to the written examination and viva voce test Rule of these rules prescribes that a competitive examination shall be held in accordance with the Regulations set out in Appendix for the purpose of selection by competition of candidates to <ORG> Executive Branch and other allied services and under Regulations and every ex service officer has to appear in a written examination in compulsory subjects carrying in the aggregate marks and a viva voce test carrying marks and likewise every candidate belonging to the general category has to appear in a written examination in subjects carrying in the aggregate marks and for him also there is a viva voce test carrying marks The argument of the petitioners was that in case of ex service officers the marks allocated for the viva voce test were as against allocated for the written examination so that the marks allocated for the viva voce test came to of the total number of taken into account for the purpose of making selection So also in the case of candidates belonging to the general category the marks allocated for the viva voce test were as against allocated for the written examination with the result that the marks allocated for the viva voce test came to of the total number of marks for the competitive examination Selection based on merit tested impartially and objectively is the essential foundation of any useful and efficient public service While a written examination has certain distinct advantages over the viva voce test there are yet no written tests which can evaluate a candidate initiative alertness resourcefulness dependableness cooperativeness capacity for clear and logical presentation effectiveness in discussion effectiveness in meeting and dealing with others adaptability judgment ability to make decision ability to lead intellectual and moral integrity In the case of admission to a college for instance as observed by <NAME> in <NAME> case where the candidate personality is yet to develop and it is too early to identify the personal qualities for which greater importance may have to be attached in later lief greater weight has perforce to be given to performance in the written examination and the importance to be attached to the viva voce test in such a case would therefore necessarily be minimal It was for this reason that in <NAME> case this <ORG> took the view that the allocation of as high a percentage of marks as to the viva voce test was beyond all reasonable proportion and rendered the selection of the candidates arbitrary But as pointed out by <NAME> in the case of services to which recruitment has necessarily to be made from persons of mature personality interview test may be the only way subject to basic and essential academic and professional requirements being satisfied There cannot be any hard and fast rule regarding the precise weight to be given to the viva voce test as against the written examination But while considering what percentage of marks may legitimately be allocated for the viva voce test without incurring the reproach of arbitrariness it must be remembered that ex service officers would ordinarily be middle aged persons of mature personality and it would be hard on them at that age to go through a long written examination involving subjects and hence it would not be unfair to require them to go through a shorter written examination in only subjects and submit to a viva voce test carrying a higher percentage of marks than that might be prescribed in case of younger candidates The position is no different when we examine the question in regard to the percentage of marks allocated for the viva voce test in case of persons belonging to the general category But the question which then arises for consideration is as to what is the effect of allocation of such a high percentage of marks for the viva voce test both in case of ex service officers and in case of other candidates on the selections made by <ORG> Though we have taken the view that the percentage of marks allocated for the viva voce test in both these cases is excessive we do not think we would be justified in the exercise of our discretion in setting aside the selections made by <ORG> after the lapse of almost two years The percentage of marks allocated for the viva voce test case of ex service officers may for reasons we have already discussed be somewhat higher than the percentage for the candidates belonging to the general category We would therefore direct that in case of ex service officers having regard to the fact that they would ordinarily be middle aged persons with personalities fully developed the percentage of marks allocated for the viva voce test may be Whatever selections are made by <ORG> in the future shall be on the basis that the marks allocated for the viva voce test shall not exceed per cent in case of candidates belonging to the general category and per cent in case of ex service officers The selection of candidates for the administrative services must therefore be made strictly on merits keeping in view various factors which go to make up a strong efficient and people oriented administrator It is therefore essential that when selections to <ORG> are being made a sitting Judge of <ORG> to be nominated by the Chief Justice of the State should be invited to participate in the interview as an expert and since such sitting Judge comes as an expert who by reason of the fact that he is a sitting <ORG> Judge knows the quality and character of the candidates appearing for the interview the advice given by him should ordinarily be accepted unless there are strong and cogent reasons for not accepting such advice and such strong and cogent reasons must be recorded in writing by the Chairman and members of <ORG> We are giving this direction to <ORG> in every State because we are anxious that the finest talent should be recruited in <ORG> and that can be secured only by having a real expert whose advice constitutes a determinative factor in the selection process We accordingly allow the appeals set aside the judgment of <ORG> and reject the challenge to the validity of the selections made by <ORG> to <ORG> Executive Branch and other allied services We would therefore direct that all the candidates who secured a minimum of per cent marks in the written examination but who could not find entry in the select list should be given one more opportunity of appearing in the competitive examination which would now have to be held in accordance with the principles laid down in this Judgment and this opportunity should be given to them even though they may have passed the maximum age prescribed by the rules for recruitment to <ORG> Executive Branch and other allied services
