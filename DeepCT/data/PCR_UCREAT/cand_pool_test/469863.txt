When the Writ Petition came up for hearing before <NAME> he noticed that one of the questions that arose in the case was as to whether the widow was competent to transfer the whole of her agricultural holding without the prior permission of the Settlement Officer Consolidation as required by Section ii of the Act He accordingly referred the matter to <ORG> and that is how this petition has come up before us To begin with we might state that although the learned Judge has not indicated as to whether the entire case has to be decided by <ORG> or only the question relating to the interpretation of Section ii of the Act yet having regard to the fact and the circumstances of the case the intention of the learned Judge was to refer only the limited question relating to the interpretation of Section ii and not the whole case because even if the petitioners fail on this ground their alternative pleas will have to be examined Act XXXVIII of and reads as under Notwithstanding anything contained in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act no tenure holder except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall i Use his holdings or any part thereof for purpose not connected with agriculture horticulture or animal husbandry including pisciculture and poultry farming or ii transfer by way of sale gift or exchange any part of his holding in the consolidation area Provided that a tenure holder may continue to use his holding or any part thereof for any purpose for which it was in use prior to the date specified in the notification issued under Sub section of Section The same expression is used in the proviso which in fact is a proviso to Clause i so that ban on the user of agricultural holding for non agricultural purpose extends to the holding as a whole as also to a part thereof Obviously the ban contemplated under Clause i is not co extensive with the ban contained in Clause ii otherwise there is no reason why the expression holding or any part thereof should not have been used in Clause ii also <NAME> AIR All <NAME> when the view taken in the earlier cases was affirmed There is yet another decision of a <ORG> of this court consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> JJ <ORG> agreed with the view taken by the earlier <ORG> in the case of Smt If one has regard to the object underlying the provisions in question it becomes quite clear as to why the ban in Clauses i and ii is not co extensive A different view would not only introduce an element of an uncertainty and confusion it would also have the effect of unsettling transactions which might have been entered on the faith of those decisions There is a lot of force in this contention also but it is not necessary to invoke the doctrine of stare decisis because we are of the firm view that there is no ambiguity whatsoever in the language in which this provision is couched and having regard to all the facts and the circumstances of the case it is not possible to interpret it differently The question arises as to whether in such a situation we should give preference to the English version or to the Hindi version Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the <ORG> of a state has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> of the State or in Ordinances promulgated of the Governor of the state or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in paragraph iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this Article Article makes a provision for official language of a <ORG> and provides that <ORG> may by law adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the <ORG> or the Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the official purposes Article makes a provision about the official language for communication between one <ORG> and another or between a <ORG> and the Union These Articles have no bearing upon the question before us It is thus clear that the provisions contained in Articles and are subject to the provisions contained in Article Thus when there is a conflict between the English version of a Statute of <ORG> and its version in a local language the version in English language will prevail over the version in the local language There is no competition between the two
