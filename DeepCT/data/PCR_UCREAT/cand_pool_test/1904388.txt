DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH PATHAK BENCH PATHAK SARKARIA RANJIT <NAME> CITATION AIR SCR SCC ACT Termination Simpliciter An order terminating the services of a temporary Government servant and ex facie innocuous in that it does not cast any stigma on the Government servant or visits him with penal consequences amounts to termination simpliciter Order does not contravene Article of the Constitution of India At the stage of evidence the Deputy Inspector General of <ORG> Bareilly made an order on March quashing the disciplinary proceedings on the ground that the offence has been committed at Pithoragarh situated in a different police range and therefore the proceedings taken against the appellant were incompetent Inspector General of <ORG> made an order terminating the services of the appellant reciting that the services of the appellant are no more required and that he will be considered to have ceased to be in service The appellant filed a Writ Petition against the order terminating his services and claimed that the order contravened Article of the Constitution inasmuch as it was an order imposing the punishment of dismissal or removal from service without satisfying the conditions prescribed therein It is now settled law that an order terminating the services of a temporary Government servant and ex facie innocuous in that it does not cast any stigma on the Government servant or visits him with penal consequences must be regarded as effecting a termination simpliciter but if it is discovered on the basis of material adduced that although innocent in its terms the order was passed in fact with a view to punishing the Government servant it is a punitive order which can be passed only after complying with Art The function of the <ORG> is to discover the nature of the order by attempting to ascertain what was the motivating consideration in the mind of the authority which prompted the order In the instant case a the appellant was a temporary Government servant and the question whether he should be retained in service was a matter which arose directly during the drive instituted by the Inspector General of <ORG> in March for weeding out <ORG> Officers who were unsuitable or unfit to be continued in service the material which the Superintendent of <ORG> considered was sufficient to lead to the conclusion that the appellant who was a temporary Government servant was not suitable for being retained in service his general character and conduct led to that impression and there was nothing to show that the impugned order was made by way of punishment the circumstance that a disciplinary proceeding had been instituted against him earlier does not in itself lead to the inference that the impugned order was by way of punishment and the impugned order was not intended by way of punishment The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave arises out of a writ petition filed by a police officer aggrieved by the termination of his services But at this stage the Deputy Inspector General of Police <NAME> made an order on March quashing the disciplinary proceedings on the ground that the offence had been committed at Pithoragarh situated in a different police range and therefore the proceedings taken against the appellant were incompetent Meanwhile on March the Inspector General of Police Uttar Pradesh had issued a letter to all Superintendents of Police in the State directing them to submit a list of Sub Inspectors whose reputation and integrity were very low or who were generally involved in scandalous conduct drinking immorality or other acts injurious to the reputation of the Police service or who were involved in encouraging crime On April the Deputy Inspector General of Police made an order terminating the services of the appellant The appellant filed a writ petition against the order terminating his services and claimed that the order contravened Article of the Constitution inasmuch as it was an order imposing the punishment of dismissal or removal from service without satisfying the conditions prescribed in that provision In the appeal before us it is urged for the appellant that <ORG> was wrong in holding that the order terminating the appellant services was not an order imposing a punishment We are referred to the disciplinary proceedings instituted against the appellant in and it is submitted that although the order of termination does not refer to those proceedings and the charge on which they were commenced the appellant services were terminated with a view to punish him for contracting a second marriage without prior permission of the <ORG> It is now settled law that an order terminating the services of a temporary <ORG> servant and ex facie innocuous in that it does not cast my stigma on the <ORG> servant or visits him with penal consequences must be regarded as effecting a termination simpliciter but if it is discovered on the basis of material adduced that although innocent in its terms the order was passed in fact with a view to punishing the <ORG> servant it is a punitive order which can be passed only after complying with Article of the Constitution The function of the court is to discover the nature of the order by attempting to ascertain what was the motivating consideration in the mind of the authority which prompted the order There is nothing to show that the impugned order was made by way of punishment The appeal fails and is dismissed but in the circumstances there is no order as to costs
