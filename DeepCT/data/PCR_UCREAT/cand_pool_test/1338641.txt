This being so there is I think much to be said for the view of the Allahabad and Calcutta <ORG>s recognizing the right of the founder heirs to make fresh arrangements for the devolution of the trust instead of leaving it to devolve as otherwise it must in the family of the founder subject to the difficulties as to its exercise and enjoyment to which I have already alluded The institution of hereditary trusteeship is held to rest on the intention of the donor either expressed in the instrument of trust or to be presumed from usage and the doctrine of reverter to the heirs of the donor on failure of the line of devolution prescribed by him must also it seems to me rest on his presumed intention But in such an event also it seems to me more convenient and more in accordance with the presumed intention of the founder to allow fresh arrangements to be made instead of leaving the office to devolve on the heirs I would answer the question in the affirmative To my mind the question whether the right of nominating a trustee to a Hindu religious endowment vests in the heirs of the founder in the absence or failure of a specific provision in the deed of endowment or where there are No special usages or circumstances indicating a different mode of devolution is concluded by authority and must be answered in the affirmative The statement that it is obvious that in the management of charitable institutions the heirs of the founder can have no legal right to interfere unless under some special powers given to them by the founder should not be given a wider application at was subject to the condition that the devolution in the ordinary line of descent is not inconsistent with or opposed to the purpose the founder had in view in establishing the worship It is contended that the right of the heirs of the founder is limited to their holding the office themselves and does not include the power to nominate or appoint a trustee On referring to the decree passed in accordance with the above direction it is evident that the suggestion made in the Order of Reference that the decree drawn up by <ORG> only declared the right of the heir of the founder to offer advice was based on a clear misapprehension But it does not seem to me that nomination of a trustee by the heirs of the founder who on the failure of the line of trustees indicated by the deed of endowment would themselves be entitled to act as trustees is ipso facto the same thing as alienation of the office of a trustee by the hereditary trustee At the same time I am not convinced that there are really insuperable difficulties in working out the view which upholds the right of the heirs of the founder to nominate and appoint trustees The argument before <ORG> in which however nothing new was said and the further consideration which I have given to this matter have in no way changed the opinion which Mr Justice <NAME> and myself expressed in the referring order I am unable to see why it must in the absence of any person nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees by the deed of endowment and in the absence of a statutory power the <ORG> will appoint a person to carry out the trusts A Hindu who makes a gift to an idol or founds a charity does not resort to the machinery of trusts but makes a direct gift to the charitable object which is conceived of as a juridical person and there is no need of incorporation either In such a case where he does not appoint another person to manage the properties so given or settle a scheme for such management as he is entitled to do at the time of the endowment and as a part of the same transaction the natural presumption or the legal inference is that he intends to manage the property himself on behalf of the charity or reserves the management to himself Such management may pass to his heirs by inheritance just as a legal estate of herit nce may pass in England It seems to me fairly clear from the above observations that whatever other rights the founders heirs may have they had no right of nomination for even if they were incompetent to perform the Sheba or worship they were not incompetent to nominate persons qualified to perform the worship and their Lordships do not appear to contemplate the existence of a power of nomination at all which power is certainly not necessarily appendant to the trusteeship or Shebaitship as is assumed in the Allahabad cases There <NAME> after stating the two propositions both of them well established namely that the devolution of the management of the trust depends upon the terms of its original constitution whether they are proved by direct evidence as for example the production of a deed of endowment or by the proof of usage that the office of <NAME> is held to be vested in the founders heirs in default of evidence that he has disposed of it otherwise proceeded to lay down a third proposition and said that from these propositions it necessarily follows that when a <NAME> appointed by a founder fails to nominate a successor in accordance with the condition or usage of the endowment the management reverts to the representative of the founder Where a founder commits the management of the charity to a trustee the presumption raised or the legal inference drawn in cases where he makes no arrangement for the management does not arise and there is no presumption under the Hindu Law any more than under the English Law that he reserves any right of interference or reversion of management after he has once definitely placed the properties given by him in the possession and management of third parties It appears to me that these cases treat the trusteeship or <NAME>ship as a species of private property which is vested as an absolute estate of inheritance in the founder an estate in fee simple if I may borrow an expresion from the English Law of Real Property from out of which the founder is entitled to carve out a particular estate retaining the reversion which again becomes an estate in possession vesting in him or his heirs as the case may be on the determination of the particular estate the founder or his heirs being entitled either to enjoy it themselves or again to carve out a particular estate therefrom It need scarcely be pointed out that the office of trustee as we have in this case is inalienable and cannot be delegated and any notion of their alienability is contrary to the express decisions of <ORG> as regards the trusteeship of Hindu Religious Endowments and religious offices An appointment of new trustee by the existing trustee or trustees is in effect nothing less than the transfer of the trusteeship and a power to appoint new trustees cannot exist unless given by the founder at the time of foundation see Perry on Trust Section Further though I have no precise notion of the nature of the rights of patronage and visitation vested in the private founder and his heirs so far as I understand it such rights cannot from the nature of the case include a right of nomination of trusteRs The last <NAME> who so succeeded was found guilty of breach of trust and was removed and there was a vacancy which could not be filled in accordance with the prescribed mode At page of the report <ORG>usami Ayyar <NAME> than whom no one knew more of the religious and charitable institutions of this part of the country said that Exhibit I the deed of endowment shows that the land in dispute was given for a specific religious purpose in order that that purpose might be carried out in perpetuity for the benefit of the grantor family and the respondent as the representative of that family for the time being is entitled to step forth when that purpose is neglected and the produce of the land is misapplied and to ask the <ORG> to prevent the misappropriation and to see that the income of the endowment is applied to its legitimate purposes I have dealt with this case at some length as I consider that this decision is authority against the propositions laid down by <NAME> though it is cited by him as supporting those propositions
