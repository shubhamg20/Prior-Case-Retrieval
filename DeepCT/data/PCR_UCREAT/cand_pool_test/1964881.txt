If there are any reservations or restrictions then they should not be arbitrary and must be justifiable on the basis of some policy or valid principles which by themselves are reasonable and not discriminatory The policy of the <ORG> is to promote efficiency in the administration to provide an incentive to the uneconomic units to achieve efficiency to prohibit concentration of economic power and to control monopolies so that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good and to ensure that while promoting industrial growth there is reduction in concentration of wealth and that the economic power is brought about to secure social and economic justice In view of the conditions in the tender notice validity whereof was not questioned the <ORG> had the right to either accept or reject the lowest offer However the determination whether an agreement unrea sonably restrains the trade depends on the nature of the agreement and on the surrounding circumstances that give rise to an inference that the parties intended to restrain the trade and monopolise the same There is not enough material to conclude that in fact there was formation of a cartel the authorities reserved a right to reject a lower price The legitimacy of an expectation can be Inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed in regular and natural sequence A person who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation in the first instance must satisfy that there is a foundation and thus has locus standi to make such a claim The decision taken by the authority must be found to be arbitrary unreasonable and not taken in public interest The concept of legitimate expectation can have no role to plan and the <ORG> must not usurp the discretion of the public authority which is empowered to take the decisions under law and the court is expected to apply an objective standard which leaves to the deciding authority the full range of choice which the legislature is presumed to have intended Even in a case where the decision is left entirely to the discretion of the deciding authority without any such legal bounds and if the decision is taken fairly and objectively the court will not interfere on the ground of procedural fairness to a person whose interest based on legitimate expectation might be affected A A If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary discriminatory unfair or based gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles It can be one of the grounds to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference The concept of legitimate expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasury of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the court out of review on the merits particularly when the element of speculation and uncertainty is inherent in that very concept Otherwise a resourceful litigant having vested interests in contracts licences etc They provide for constitution of <ORG> and the procedure to be followed in the matter of inviting tenders A There is no legally fixed procedure regarding fixation of price and particularly regarding allotment giving scope to a legitimate expectation The modifications In the decision of the <ORG> by way of judicial review are not on the ground of legitimate expectation and violation of principles of natural justice but on the other ground namely the decision of the authorities was based on wrong assumption of formation of <ORG> Therefore these cannot be said to be irrelevant considerations and as a matter of fact they had been duly given effect to and weightage was given accordingly in respect of allotment of quantities to various manufacturers within the four corners of the limited tender The judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> By our order dated th January while disposing of these special leave petitions we gave our conclusions and we proposed to deliver the detailed judgment at a later stage giving all the reasons in support of those conclusions We hereby deliver the detailed judgment In our earlier order we stated the relevant facts and the issues involved in a concised form After the approving authority took these decisions the file went to the Chairman The noted that action will be taken as decided by the <ORG>inister but added that it results in dual pricing namely one to the three manufacturers and the higher one to the others and therefore the <ORG>inister may consider whether they could counter offer the lower price to all the manufacturers as that would result in saving much more In view of this final decision taken by the approving authority a telegram was issued to the three manufacturers giving them a Counter offer of Rs In the course of the judgment <ORG> also made certain observations to the effect that the decision of the approving authority is arbitrary and that the Government has no justification to offer a higher price than the market price to any supplier to rehabilitate it Before <ORG> in the two writ petitions filed by <ORG> and <NAME> the other manufacturers figured as respondents Nos to and <ORG> otherwise known as <ORG> figured as respondent No In our earlier order we have already referred to the various Submissions made by the learned counsel on behalf of <ORG> and on behalf of the respondents particularly <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> and other smaller manufacturers there was scope for enter training suspicion by <ORG> that they formed a cartel since all the three of them quoted identical price and the opinion entertained by the concerned authorities including the Minister that these three big manufacturers formed a cartel was not per se malicious or was actuated by any extraneous considerations and the authorities acted in a bonafide manner in taking the stand that the three big manufacturers formed a cartel Before we proceed to consider each of these issues and give our reasons we shall deal with few general submissions regarding the tender system and the economic policy of the <ORG> in the matter of stopping monopolistic tendencies <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> at the outset submitted that in a case of this nature the <ORG> must either by way of public auction or by way of inviting tenders work out he lowest price and award the contract accordingly as that would safeguard the interests of the public exchequer <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> however contended that it is a matter of policy decision by the <ORG> and that where the <ORG> realises that the lowest rice offered is not reasonable and realistic it may for a variety of good and sufficient reasons reject the same If there are any reservations or restrictions then they should not be arbitrary and must be justifiable on the basis of some policy or valid principles which by themselves are reasonable and not discriminatory Under Clause it is made clear that the <ORG> does not pledge itself to accept the lowest or any tender and reserves to itself the right of acceptance of the whole or any part of the tender It must be mentioned at this stage that the validity of the conditions in the tender as such are not questioned Consequently the Government had the right to either accept or reject the lowest offer but that of course if done on a policy should he on some rational and reasonable grounds In <ORG> State of West Bengal SCR this court observed as under When the Government is trading with the public the democratic form of Government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions The activities of the government have a public element and therefore there should be fairness and equality It must therefore be taken to be the law that where the <ORG> is dealing with the public whether by way of giving job so entering into contracts or issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of largess the <ORG> cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and like a private individual deal with any person it pleases but its action must be in conformity with standard or norms which is not arbitrary irrational or irrelevant SCR an order awarding contract by the <ORG> to a party was questioned on the ground that it was arbitrary malafide and not in public interest and the same created monopoly in favour of that party and that the contract was awarded without affording an opportunity to others to compete and the same is not based on any rational or relevant principle and therefore was violative of Article of the Constitution and also the rule of administrative law which inhibits the arbitrary action by the <ORG> A Bench of this Court while approving the principles laid down in the above cases further observed thus Though ordinarily a private individual would be guided by economic considerations of self gain any action taken by him it is always open to under the law to act contrary to his self interest or to oblige another in entering into a contract or dealing with his property The constitutional power conferred on the <ORG> cannot be exercised by it arbitrarily or capriciously or in an unprincipled manner it has to be exercised for the public good Every activity of the <ORG> has a public element in it and it must therefore be informed with reason and guided by public interest If the <ORG> awards a contract of leases out or otherwise deals with its property or grants any other largess it would be liable to be tested for its validity on the touch stone of reasonableness and public interest and if it fails to satisfy either test it would be unconstitutional and invalid After referring to these decisions it was further held in <NAME> case supra as under Any action taken by the Government with a view to giving effect to any one or more of the Directive Principles would ordinarily subject to any constitutional or legal inhibitions or other over riding consid erations qualify for being regarded as reasonable while an action which is inconsistent with or runs counter to a Directive Principle would incur the reproach of being unreasonable It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the Government cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the <ORG> such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest The <ORG> therefore cannot for example give a contract or sell or lease out its property for a consideration less than the highest that can be obtained for it unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest do so We have referred to these considerations only illustratively for there may be an infinite variety of considerations which may have to be taken into account by the <ORG> in formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of various considerations which have weighed with the <ORG> in taking a particular action that the Court would have to decide whether the action of the <ORG> is reasonable and in public interest emphasis supplied On the question of courts interference in an action taken by the Government it was further observed as under But one basic principle which must guide the <ORG> in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the <ORG>al action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the <ORG> by proper and adequate material The <ORG> cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the <ORG> is unreasonable or without public interest because as we said above there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the <ORG> in taking action and therefore the <ORG> would not strike down government action as invalid on this ground unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest The law is now well established that the <ORG> need not deal with anyone but if it does so it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure There is no reason why the power vested in the <ORG> to refuse to accept the highest bid should be confined to inadequacy of bid only There may be a variety of good and sufficient reasons apart from inadequacy of bids which may impel the <ORG> not to accept the highest bid Again the <ORG> may change or refuse its policy from time to time and we see no reason why change of policy by the Govern ment subsequent to the auction but before its confirmation may not be a sufficient justification for the refusal to accept the highest bid If the government has the power to accept or not to accept the highest hid and if the <ORG> has also the power to change its policy from time to time There is no concluded contract till the bid is accepted Before there was a concluded contract it was open to the bidders to withdraw their bids see Union of India and ors Citizens cannot have any funda mental right to trade or carry on business in the properties or rights belonging to the <ORG> nor can there he any infringement of Art Nor is the test the court own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation SCR it was observed thus We must not forget that in complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore its validity cannot be tested on any rigid a priori considerations or on the application of any straight jacket formula The court must while adjudging the constitutional validity of an executive decision relating to economic matters grant a certain measure of freedom or play in the joints to the executive It is against the back round of these observations and keeping the mind that we must now proceed to deal with the contention of the petitioners based on article of the Constitution hearing in mind the object of supply and equitable distribution of the commodity at a fair price in the best interest of the general public is a matter for decision exclusively within the province of <ORG> and such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review Rejection of the principle of fixation of price unit wise on actual cost basis of each unit was reiterated and it was pointed out that such a policy promotes efficiency and provides and incentive to cut down the cost introducing an element of healthy competition among the units Regarding the differential treatment given to <ORG> this Court held that The only surviving question for consideration is the argument in Civil Appeal No of for a differential treatment to the appellant <ORG> on the anology of <ORG> Kottayam It has been stated that it is a sub standard unit with a capacity of tonnes per annum only without any scope for expansion while the standard capacity for a unit is two lakh tonnes per annum so that this unit is not capable of expanding the capacity and it is on the whole an uneconomic unit deserving a special consideration than laws touching the civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc It has been said by no less a person than <NAME> <NAME> that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or strait jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legisla ion dealing with economic matters where having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with Nowhere has this admonition been more felicitously expressed than in <NAME> <NAME> US where <NAME> said in his inimitable style In the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility the courts have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path of judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers must take care not exceed or abuse its power It must keep within the limits of the authority committed to it It must act in good faith and it must act reasonably It was further observed thus The function of the <ORG> is not to advise in matters relating to financial and economic policies for which bodies like <ORG> are fully competent It is needless to say that such practices must inevitably impede the best utilisation of the nation means of production economic power may also manifest itself in obtaining control of large areas of economic activity by a few industrialists by diverse means Therefore the avowed policy of the <ORG> particularly from the point of view of public interest is to prohibit concentration of economic power and to control monopolies so that the ownership and control of the material resources of the Community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good and to ensure that while promoting industrial growth there is reduction in concentration of wealth and that the economic power is brought about to secure social and economic justice Bearing the above principles in mind we shall now proceed to examine the action taken by the <ORG> in the matter of fixation of the price and distribution of quantities and see whether the same has been done pursuant to a policy and thus reasonable or whether there has been an arbitrary exercise of power As held by the courts change of policy by it self does not affect the pursuant action provided it is rational and reasonable However the submission is that the decision taken pursuant to this policy in the matter of fixation of price and distribution of quantities is based on wrong grounds and suffers from the vice of unreasonableness The further submission is that these manufacturers have a legitimate expectation of being treated in certain ways by the administrative authorities on the basis of practice and policy of the previous years and such a decision which is punitive and which defeats such legitimate expectation and which is taken without affording an opportunity to these manufacturers to explain is violative of principles of natural justice First we shall consider the submissions regarding the formation of cartel by these big manufacturers The word Cartel has a particular meaning with reference to monopolistic control of the market However the determination whether such agreement unreasonably restrains the trade depends on the nature of the agreement and on the surrounding circumstances that give rise to an inference that the parties intended to restrain the trade and monopolise the same On a certiorari <ORG> while considering the standards supplied by <ORG> in evaluating the summary judgment observed thus To survive petitioners motion for summary judgment respondents must establish that there is a genuine issue of material US fact as to whether petitioners entered into an illegal conspiracy that caused respondents to If the losses have been substantial as would likely be necessary US in order to drive out the competition petitioners would most likely have to sustain their cartel for years simply to break even offered by these manufacturers during the post tender stage was not predatory and that the view taken by the authorities that such an offer of lower price was predatory one confirming the formation of a cartel is also unwarranted It was also held therein as under To survive a motion for a summary judgment a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of of the Sherman Act must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently By our earlier order dated th January we directed <ORG> to examine the matter afresh regarding the reasonable price on the basis of the data that may be placed by these big manufacturers in support of their offer of Rs No doubt there was an apprehension that if such predatory price has to be accepted the smaller manufacturers will not be in a position to compete and may result in elimination of free competition But there again the authorities reserved a right to reject such lower price Shri Nariman Venugopal and <ORG> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> respectively contended that the <ORG> were bound to follow the rules and standards pertaining to the tender system and on the basis of these provisions and the course of conduct followed by the <ORG> in the matter of fixation of price and allotment of quota in the past let the manufacturers believe that the same course of conduct would be followed and the manufacturers legitimately expected that they would be treated equally and in a non arbitrary manner and such legitimate expectation is a right guaranteed under Article There is no unfettered discretion in public law A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is fairplay in action The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen in such a situation may not by it self be a distinct enforceable right but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non arbitrariness a necessary concomitant of the rule of law emphasis supplied In <ORG> <ORG> SCALE justice Ray speaking for the Bench observed as under In the aforesaid facts <ORG> were entitled to legitimate expectation of following consistent past practice in the matter of allotment even though they may not have any legal right in private law to receive such treatment In a case of legitimate expectation if the authority proposes to defeat a person legitimate expectation it should afford him an opportunity to make representations in the matter We may also refer to a decision of <ORG> in <ORG> and others versus Minister for Civil Service reported in <ORG> page It has been held in the said decision that an aggrieved person was entitled to judicial review if he could show that a decision of the public authority affected him of some benefit or advantage which in the past he had been permitted to enjoy and which he legitimately expected to be permitted to continue to enjoy either until he was given reasons for withdrawal and the opportunity to comment on such reasons We have not been shown any compelling reasons taken into consideration by <ORG> to make a departure from the existing policy of allotment with reference to seniority in Registration by introducing a new guideline The rules provide for constitution of <ORG> and the Procedure to be followed in the matter of inviting tenders xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx Splitting should not be done merely with a view to utilising developed capacity of the different sources but should be for valid reasons to be recorded in writing for splitting the tendered quantity From these provisions it becomes clear that the tenderer can not expect that his entire tender should be accepted in respect of the quantity and that the <ORG> have a night to accept the tender as a whole or a part of it or portion of the quantity offered It is not in dispute that in the past also there were many instances where the <ORG> as per the procedure followed arrived at decisions in respect of both price and quantity for good and justifiable reasons In the year the quantities of <ORG> and <ORG> were in fact reduce from the allocations made by <ORG> which made its recommendations on the basis of certain data Therefore it is evident that there is no legally fixed procedure regarding fixation of price and particularly regarding allotment giving scope to a legitimate expectation A person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment The expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority including an implied representation or from consistent past prac tice The existence of a legitimate expectation may have a number of different consequences it may give locus standi to seek leave to apply for judicial review it may mean that the authority ought not to act so as to defeat the expectation without some overriding reason of public policy to justify its doing so or it may mean that if the authority proposes to defeat a person legitimate expectations it must afford him an opportunity to make representation on the matter The courts also distinguish for example in licensing cases between original applications to renew and revocations a party who has been granted a licence may have legitimate expectation that it will be renewed unless there is some good reason not to do so and may therefore be entitled to greater procedural protection than a mere applicant for a grant emphasis supplied We find that the concept of legitimate expectation first stepped into the English Law in <NAME> Secretary of State for Home Affairs Ch wherein it was observed that an alien who had been given leave to enter the United Kingdom for a limited period had a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the permitted time and if that permission was revoked before the time expires that alien ought to be given an opportunity of making representations It was contended that the Minister had a duty to consult the staff as per the existing practice and that though the employee did not have a legal right he had a legitimate expectation that the existing practice would be followed The Court held as under An aggrieved person was entitled to invoke judicial review if he showed that a decision of a public authority affected him by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which in the past he had been permitted to enjoy and which he could legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to enjoy either until he was given reasons for its withdrawal and the opportunity to comment on those reasons or because he had received an assurance that it would not be withdrawn before he had been given the opportunity of making representations against the withdrawal SCR <NAME> case and <ORG> case supra and contended that failure to follow the existing procedure resulting in denial of a right directly arising out of legitimate expectation is per se arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore illegal and consequently violative of Article of the constitution Time is a three fold present the present as we experience it the past as a present memory and future as a present expectation The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed in regular and natural sequence It is stated that Legitimate expectation is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative action and this creation takes its place beside such principles as the rules of natural justice unreasonableness the fiduciary duty of local authorities and in future perhaps the principle of proportionality It made its first appearance in a case where alien students of scientology were refused extension of their entry permits as an act of policy by the Home Secretary who had announced that no discretionary benefits would be granted to this Sect <ORG> held that they had no legitimate expectation of extension beyond the permitted time and so no right to a hearing though revocation of their permits within that time would have been contrary to legitimate expectation In a different context where car hire drivers had habitually offended against airport bye laws with many convictions and unpaid fines it was held that they had no legitimate expectation of being heard before being banned by the airport authority There is some ambiguity in the dicta about legitimate expectation which may mean either expectation of a fair hearing or expectation of the licence or other benefit which is being sought emphasis supplied In some cases a question arose whether the concept of legitimate expectation is an impact only on the procedure or whether it also can have a substantive impact and if so to what extent Section of the Act empowered the Governor to appoint any qualified person to be a magistrate in the new <ORG> Mr <NAME> who had been a Stipendiary Magistrate in charge of a Court of petty Sessions under the old system applied for but was refused an appointment under the new system The challenge was upheld by the appellate court on the ground that the selection committee had taken into account an adverse report on him without giving a notice to him of the contents of the same In the appeal by the Attorney General against that order before <ORG> it was argued on behalf of Mr <NAME> that he had a legitimate expectation that he would be treated in the same way as his former colleagues considering his application on its own merits Coming to the nature of the substantive impact of the doctrine <NAME> observed that the doctrine of legitimate expectations ought not to unlock the gate which shuts the court out of review on the merits and that the <ORG> should not trespass into the forbidden field of the merits by striking down administrative acts or decisions which failed to fulfill the expectations Indeed in a case where ex hypothesis there is no right to be heard it may be thought the more important to fair dealing that a promise or undertaking given by a minister as to how he will proceed should be kept I go further If he is a man who has some right or interest or some legitimate expectation of which it would not be fair to deprive him without a hearing or reasons given then these should he afforded hint according as the case may demand It must affect such other person either a by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against him in private law or by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either i he has in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated to him some rational ground for withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment or ii lie has received assurance from the decision maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn In Attorney General for New South Wales case it is observed as under Some advocates of judicial intervention would encourage the courts to expand the scope and purpose of judicial review especially to provide some check on <ORG> which nowadays exercises enormous powers beyond the capacity of the parliament to supervise effectively Moreover the notion of a legitimate expectation falling short a legal right is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise accords with law emphasis supplied In this very case <NAME> after referring to <NAME> case supra observed thus Again when a court is decidsing what must be done in order to accord procedural fairness in a particular case it has regard to precisely the same circumstances as those to which the court might refer in considering whether the applicant entertains a legitimate expectation but the inquiry whether the applicant entertains a legitimate expectation is superfluous It follows that the notion of legitimate expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasury of natural justice and it ought not unlock the gate which shuts the court out of review on the merits There is no doubt that the respondent had a legitimate expectation of continuing in his position as a stipendiary magistrate such that it should apart from statute have been unfair to remove him from that position without according him a hearing Accordingly it made provision for those who where not so appointed Any unfairness was the product of the legislation which conferred no right upon the respondent to a procedure other than that which it laid down But as discussed above a person who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation in the first instance must satisfy that there is a foundation and thus has locus standi to make such a claim In considering the same several factors which give rise to such legitimate expectation must be present The decision taken by the authority must be found to be arbitrary unreasonable and not taken in public interest In a given case whether there are such facts and circumstances giving rise to a legitimate expectation it would primarily be a question of fact If these tests are satisfied and if the court is satisfied that a case of legitimate expectation is made out then the next question Would be whether failure to give an opportunity of hearing before the decision affect such legitimate expectation is taken has resulted in failure of justice and whether on that ground the decision should he quashed We find in Attorney General for New South wales case that the entire case law on the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been considered In Public Law and Politics edited by <NAME> we find an article by <NAME> in which the learned author after examining the views expressed in the cases decided by eminent judges to whom we have referred to above concluded thus The confusion and uncertainty at the heart of the concept stems from its origin But there again the court has to see whether it was done as a policy or in the public interest either by way of rule or by way of a legislation Therefore the limitation is extremely confined and if the according of natural justice does not condition the exercise of the power the concept of legitimate expectation can have no role to play and the court must not usurp the discretion of the public authority which is empowered to take the decisions under law and the court is expected to apply and objective standard which leaves to the decising authority the full range of choice which the legislature is presumed to have intended It can therefore be seen that legitimate expectation can at the most be one of the grounds which may give rise to judicial review but the granting of relief is very much limited It would thus appear that there are stronger reasons as to why the legitimate expectation should not be substantively protected than the reasons as to why it should be protected As observed in Attornry General for New South Wales case To strike down the exercise of administrative power solely on the ground of avoiding the disappointment of the legitimate expectations of an individual would be to set the courts adrift on a featureless sea of pragmatism Moreover the notion of a legitimate expectation falling short of a legal right is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of power when its exercise otherwise accords with law If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary discriminatory unfair or based gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article but a claim biased on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles It can be one of the ground to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference It depends very much on the facts and the recognised general principles of administrative law applicable to such facts and the concept of legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative action must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative power in a particular case It follows that the concept of legitimate expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasury of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the court out of review on the merits particularly when the element of speculation and uncertainty is inherent in that very concept Otherwise a resourceful litigant having vested interests in contracts In view of our conclusions in respect of the quantities allotted and the price fixed it may not be necessary for us to enter into further discussion on this aspect However we considered this aspect to some extent only to show that the decision in respect of price fixation as well as allotment of quantities even though to some extent at variation with the procedure followed during the previous years was not based on any irrelevant consideration Therefore from the point of view of preventing monopoly in the public interest the decision in question was taken in a bonafide manner However we make it clear that the said modifications by way of judicial review is not on the ground of legitimate expectation and violative of principles of natural justice but on the other ground namely the decision of the authorities was based on wrong assumption of formation of a cartel to these three big manufacturers is punitive in nature visiting with civil consequences and such a decision taken without giving an opportunity to these manufacturers is violative of principles of natural justice In view of our above mentioned conclusions resulting in modification of the decision of the authorities both in respect of price fixation and in allotment of quantities there is no necessity to consider this aspect again in detail It was next contended that the consideration that some manufacturers are small and others are BIFR companies taken into account by the approving authority for deviating from the age old practice in allocation of quantities is irrelevant and discriminatory and therefore the decision is bad Therefore these can not be said to be irrelevant considerations and as a matter of fact they had been duly given effect to and weightage was given accordingly in respect of allotment of quantities to various manufacturers within the four corners of the limited tender As no price preferential treatment was given to any one of them In the past also there were such variations based on these circumstances
