DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH BHARUCHA CJI QUADRI SANTOSH HEGDE VARIAVA PATIL JUDGMENT JUDGMENT DELIVERED BY PATIL Finding conflict of views expressed by <NAME> of three learned Judges of this court on the question the Reference is made SCR has expressed the contrary view that non approval of the order of dismissal or failure to make application under Section would not render the order of dismissal inoperative failure to apply for approval under Section would only render the employer liable to punishment under Section of the Act and the remedy of the employee is either by way of a complaint under Section A or by way of a reference under Section of the Act It may be stated here itself that there was no reference in this decision to the two earlier decisions aforementioned Rival submissions were made on behalf of the parties in support of the respective contentions in the light of aforementioned decisions and referring to and relying on the provisions contained in Sections and A of the Act Answer to the question on which conflicting decisions are rendered as noticed above depends on a fair reading and proper interpretation of Section of the Act Prior to the amendment of provision contained in Section corresponded to the present Section only The object behind enacting Section as it stood before it was amended in was to allow continuance of industrial proceedings pending before any authority court tribunal prescribed by the Act in a peaceful atmosphere undisturbed by any other industrial dispute At the same time it seems to have been felt that there was need to provide some safeguards for a workman who may be discharged or dismissed during the pendency of a dispute on account of some matter unconnected with the dispute This position is clear by reading re drafted expanded Section in containing five sub sections For the present purpose we are concerned with the proviso to Section In the <ORG> case supra dealing with the contention that if the employer dismisses or discharges a workman and then applies for approval of the action taken and the tribunal refuses to approve the action the workman would be left with no remedy as there is no provision for reinstatement in Section it is held that if the tribunal does not approve of the action taken by the employer the result would be that the action taken by him would fall and thereupon the workman would be deemed never to have been dismissed or discharged and would remain in the service of the employer In the case of <ORG> supra it is reiterated and stated thus It is now well settled that the requirements of the proviso have to be satisfied by the employer on the basis that they form part of the same transaction and stated generally the employer must either pay or offer the salary for one month to the employee before passing an order of his discharge or dismissal and must apply to the specified authority for approval of his action at the same time or within such reasonably short time thereafter as to form part of the same transaction Per contra in Punjab Beverages supra it is held that an order dismissing the workman contravening Section shall not be void and inoperative and hence the workman was not entitled to maintain the application for determination and payment of wages under Section a workman can proceed under Section only after the tribunal has adjudicated on a complaint under Section A or on a reference under Section that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified and has set aside that order and reinstated the workman rejecting a contention that the workman would be left without any remedy on the interpretation that contravention of Section does not invalidate an order of discharge or dismissal it is stated that if the employer contravenes Section he would be liable to punishment under Section and moreover the aggrieved workman can act under Section or he can make a complaint to the tribunal under Section A it was held that the withdrawal of the application made under Section stands on the same footing as if no application thereunder has been made if there was no decision on merit of the said application it cannot be said that the approval has been refused by the <ORG> The facts of the said case are the workman was dismissed from service holding him guilty after inquiry by an order dated rd December Since an industrial dispute was pending at that time in view of the provisions contained in Section the employer approached <ORG> at Chandigarh before which the industrial dispute was pending for approval of the action taken Since the employer did not respond he made an application to <ORG> under Section for determination and payment of the amount of wages due to him The employer resisted the said application inter alia on the ground that the application under Section having been withdrawn the effect of which was as if no application had been made at all even though there was contravention of Section in not making an application seeking approval it did not render the order of dismissal void ab initio and it was merely illegal and unless it is set aside in an appropriate proceeding taken by the employee under Section A or in a reference under Section <ORG> had no jurisdiction under Section to direct payment of wages to the first respondent on the basis as if he continued in service <ORG> rejected this contention and allowed the application of the workman filed under Section This Court allowing the appeals by special leave held that the employer contravened Section in dismissing the workman but such contravention did not have the effect of rendering the order of dismissal void or inoperative and hence the workman was not entitled to maintain the application under Section The reasons recorded in taking such a view are i Section in both its limbs undoubtedly uses mandatory language and Section makes it penal for the employer to commit a breach of the provisions of Section and therefore if Section stood alone it might lend itself to the construction that any action by way of discharge or dismissal taken against workman would be void if it is in contravention of Section iv The contention of the workman that in the absence of approval for action taken under Section the order of dismissal was inoperative was rejected on the ground that withdrawal of the application made for approval stood on the same footing as if no application under Section has been made at all since there was no application made under Section the <ORG> had no occasion to apply its mind to consider whether the dismissal of workman amounted to victimization or unfair labour practice Further any employer who contravenes the provisions of Section invites a punishment under with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to Rs or with both To put it in other way the said conditions being mandatory are to be satisfied if an order of discharge or dismissal passed under Section is to be operative The protection afforded to a workman under the said provision cannot be taken away If it is to be held that an order of discharge or dismissal passed by the employer without complying with the requirements of the said proviso is not void or inoperative the employer may with impunity discharge or dismiss a workman This being the position there is no need of a separate or specific order for his reinstatement Section A is available only to an employee and is intended to save his time and trouble inasmuch as he can straightaway make a complaint before the very authority where the industrial dispute is already pending between the parties challenging the order of approval instead of making efforts to raise an industrial dispute get a reference and thereafter adjudication In this view it is not correct to say that even though where the order of discharge or dismissal is inoperative for contravention of the mandatory conditions contained in the proviso or where the approval is refused a workman should still make a complaint under Section A and that the order of dismissal or discharge becomes invalid or void only when it is set aside under Section A and that till such time he should suffer misery of unemployment in spite of statutory protection given to him by the proviso to Section The view that when no application is made or the one made is withdrawn there is no order of refusal of such application on merit and as such the order of dismissal or discharge does not become void or inoperative unless such an order is set aside under Section A cannot be accepted Such an approach destroys the protection specifically and expressly given to an employee under the said proviso as against possible victimization unfair labour practice or harassment because of pendency of industrial dispute so that an employee can be saved from hardship of unemployment This provision is not intended to give any remedy to an aggrieved employee The argument that Section provides a remedy to an employee for contravention of Section is unacceptable There is nothing in Sections and A to suggest otherwise even reading them together in the context These Sections are intended to serve different purposes But the view taken in two earlier decisions of <ORG> and <ORG> is followed on the question and rightly so in our opinion In view of what is stated above we respectfully agree with and endorse the view taken in the case of <ORG> and <ORG> and further state that the view expressed in <ORG> on the question is not the correct view He was dismissed from service The appellant challenged the order of the <ORG> before <ORG> in writ petition No of In the view we have taken the contentions raised in these appeals do not help the appellant We find no merit in these appeals
