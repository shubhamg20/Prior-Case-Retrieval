DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> SRIKRISHNA JUDGMENT JUDGMENT SCR The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals arising under different factual background raise the same question of law and can therefore conveniently be disposed of by a common judgment Facts Civil Appeal Nos and of On rd May a winding up petition was filed under Section of the Companies Act seeking to wind up the company known as <ORG> Another petition by another creditor was also filed on On during the pendency of the above petitions before <ORG> the respondent a <ORG> established under the State Financial <ORG> Act On the respondent filed an application under Section read with Section of the Companies Act before <ORG> praying for leave to stand outside the winding up proceedings and realize its securities by selling the assets mortgaged to it The Company Judge disposed of the application holding that in view of the order passed by this Court the application did not survive In the meanwhile the first respondent a creditor of the second respondent had filed a petition under Section of the Companies Act on which <ORG> made an order dated for winding up of the second respondent company The appellant <ORG> appeared before the Company Judge and contended that it was a secured creditor having first charge over the mortgaged property and despite commencement of the winding up proceeding entitled to exercise its powers under Section of the SFC Act to put to sale the mortgaged assets without leave of <ORG> The learned Company Judge rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellant <ORG> and directed winding up of the company Relevant Statutory Provisions Before we address ourselves to the question of law argued it is necessary to refer to some of the relevant statutory provisions The relevant povisions of the SFC Act are Sections and which read as under Section Where any industrial concern which is under a liability to <ORG> under an agreement makes any default in repayment of any loan or advance or any instalment thereof or in meeting its obligations in relation to any guarantee given by the <ORG> or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of its agreement with <ORG> <ORG> shall have the right to take over the management or possession or both of the industrial concerns as well as the right to transfer by way of lease or sale and realize the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to <ORG> <ORG> shall have the same rights and powers with respect to goods manufactured or produced wholly or partly from goods forming part of the security held by it as it had with respect to the original goods Where any action has been taken against an industrial concern under the provisions of subsection all costs charges and expenses which in the opinion of <ORG> have been properly incurred by it as incidental thereto shall be recoverable from the industrial concern and the money which is received by it shall in the absence of any contract to the contrary be held by it in trust to be applied firstly in payment of such costs charges and expenses and secondly in discharge of the debt due to <ORG> and the residue of the money so received shall be paid to the person entitled thereto Where <ORG> has taken any action against an industrial concern under the provisions of sub section <ORG> shall be deemed to be the owner of such concern for the purpose of suits by or against the concern and shall sue and be sued in the name of the concern Section Where an industrial concern in breach of any agreement makes any default in repayment of any loan or advance or any instalment thereof or in meeting its obligations in relation to any guarantee given by the Corporation or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of its agreement with <ORG> or where <ORG> requires an industrial concern to make immediate repayment of any loan or advance under Section the industrial concern fails to make such repayment then without prejudice to the provisions of section of this Act and of section of the Transfer of Property Act any officer of <ORG> generally or specially authorized by the <ORG> in this behalf may apply to the district judge within the limits of whose jurisdiction the industrial concern carries on the whole or a substantial part of its business for one or more of the following reliefs namely a for an order for the sale of the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to <ORG> as security for the loan or advance or aa or enforcing the liability of any surety or for transferring the management of the industrial concern to <ORG> or for an interim injunction restraining the industrial concern from transferring or removing its machinery or plant or equipment from the premises of the industrial concern without the permission of the Board where such removal is apprehended Section empowers the <ORG> to move the District Judge for appropriate ad interim and interim orders in aid of action under Section Section gives an overriding effect to the provisions of the Act and reads as under Section The provision of this Act and of any rule or orders made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the memorandum or articles of associations of an industrial concern or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act but save as aforesaid the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being applicable to an industrial concern Section was inserted by Act of with effect from The relevant provisions of the Companies Act which need to be noticed are Section and A which read as under Section In the winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard to a debts provable the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities and the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons adjudged insolvent Provided that the security if every secured creditor shall be deemed to be subject to a pari passu charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen portion therein and where a secured creditor instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debt opts to realize his security a the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such charge any amount realized by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charges shall be applied ratably for the discharge of workmen dues and so much of the debt due to such secured creditor as could not be realized by him by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this proviso or the amount of the workmen portion in his security whichever is less shall rank pari passu with the workmen dues for the purpose of section Section A Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act or any other law for the time being in force in the winding up of a company a workmen dues and debts due to secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause of the proviso to sub section of Section pari passu with such dues shall be paid in priority to all other debts The Contentions It is contended on behalf of the SFCs that they are secured creditors and as such entitled to exercise their rights under the mortgage as also the statutory rights conferred on them by Section of SFC Act without interference of courts Hence it is urged that the SFCs can sell the mortgaged and charged properties without reference to any court much less <ORG> This <ORG> was required to consider the meaning of the provision any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties used in Section of the Companies Act which rendered such sales void Obviously therefore <NAME> could not have considered the impact of these amendments on the provisions of section of the Companies Act corresponding to Section of the Companies Act As a result of the proviso added in Section the security of every secured creditor is deemed to be subject to a pari passu charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen dues called workmen portion as defined in sub section therein <ORG> shall be entitled to represent the workman and enforce such charge and that any amount realised by enforcement of such charge shall be applied ratably by the Official <ORG> for the discharge of workmen dues It is true that even the amended proviso does not give the <ORG> an independent right of enforcing the charge by selling the security against which such charge is created By reason of Clause of the newly added proviso so much of the debt due to the secured creditor opting to realise security as could not be realize because of the specially created rights in favour of the workmen or the amount of the workmen portion in the security whichever is less shall rank pari passu with the workmen dues under Section A Counsel for the SFCs contended that there is a conflict between the provisions of Section read with Section A of the Companies Act on the one hand and Section of the SFC Act on the other In our view the provisions of the SFC Act were merely intended to give an expeditious remedy to the SFCs without having to go through the procedure of enforcing the mortgage under the Transfer of Properties Act In fact even under Section of the Transfer of Property Act under certain circumstances a mortgagee has the power to sell the mortgaged property in default of payment of mortgaged money without intervention of the court In public interest therefore special provisions were made by Section and enabling the SFCs to take possession of the mortgaged assets and sell them without having to move a court of law However when the debtor is a Company in winding up the rights of the SFCs are affected by the provisions of the Companies Act Looked at from this point of view therefore there is no conflict between the provisions of the SFC Act and the Companies Act Though the Companies Act may be general law the provisions introduced therein in were intended to confer special rights on the workers and pro tanto must be treated as special law made by <ORG> We have already noticed that as a result of the amendment to Section a pari passu charge to the extent of the workmen portion is created on the security of every secured creditor when he opts to realize a security by standing outside winding up <NAME> Law Dictionary th Edition defines it as By an equal progress used especially of creditors who in marshalling assets are entitled to receive out of the same fund without any precedence over each other The Official Liquidator as the representative of the workmen to enforce such pari passu charge would have the right of representing the workmen equally with the rights of the secured creditors Because of the aforesaid statutory intervention the <ORG> must necessarily contend with a pari passu charge holder who has equal rights This is precisely the reason why the judgment of this Court in <ORG> supra holds that the statutory right of the <ORG>s to sell the property under Section of the <ORG> Act is now subject to the provisions of Section and Section A of the Companies Act The statutory right to sell the property under Section of the Act has now to be exercised in tandem with the rights of pari passu charge in favour of the workmen created by the proviso to Section of the Companies Act In other words the statutory right to sell the property under Section of the Act of has to be exercised with the rights of pari passu charge to the workmen created by the proviso to Section of the Companies Act Under the proviso to sub section of Section the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and force sic enforce the above pari passu charge Therefore <ORG> was fully justified in imposing the above conditions to enable the Official Liquidator to discharge his function properly under the supervision of <ORG> as the new Section A of the Companies Act confers upon <ORG> the duty to ensure that the workmen dues are paid in priority to all other debts in accordance with the provisions of the above section If conditions are not imposed to protect the right of the workmen there is every possibility that the secured creditor may frustrate the above pari passu right of the workmen If a sale takes place it can only be simultaneously for recovery of the claim of all pari passu charge holders and sale proceeds are required to be divided proportionately in the same proportion as their dues In either event the <ORG> while granting sanction may impose appropriate conditions and give directions regarding the conduct of the sale the fixing of the reserve bid acceptance of the bid confirmation of sale and distribution of sale proceeds This was possible because the secured creditor had unrestricted right of standing outside the winding up and proceeding against the property mortgaged to him The moment a winding up order is made in respect of a debtor company the provisions of section and A come into play and whatever superior rights had been ensured to SFCs under the provisions of the SFC Act are now subjected to and operate only in conjunction with the special rights given to the workmen who as pari passu charge holders are represented by the official liquidator Even assuming to the contrary if a conflict arises then we respectfully reiterate the view taken by the <ORG> bench of this court in <ORG> case supra In other words the statutory rights to sell the property under Section of the Act of has to be exercised with the rights of pari passu charge to the workmen created by Under the proviso to sub section of Section the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and force sic enforce the above pari passu charge Far from taking a different view of the matter we too are of the same view as has been taken in the judgment of this Court in <ORG> case supra In the words of <ORG> But the fact remains it has yet been left at the option of the secured creditor to realise the security without proving his debt in the winding up proceedings In our view the reasoning of <ORG> that in case secured creditor does not opt to realise the security the liquidator by dint of the proviso to section does not become a charge holder in the estate of the company so as to exercise the right of a simple mortgagee as envisaged under section of the Transfer of Property Act appears to be non sequitur secured creditor does not opt to stand outside the winding up but relinquishes his security and proves his debt in the winding up then there is no doubt that the official liquidator will come into custody of all the assets of the company in liquidation and the distribution of the assets would have to proceed in accordance with the provisions of section A of the Companies Act in which case the secured creditor stands in line as an unsecured creditor The fact that the liquidator or the workmen do not have a right independently to enforce the charge unless the creditor decides to stand outside the winding up does not make any difference to the situation in our view In fact it is their contention that as mortgages they have a right to stand outside the winding up and are not subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of <ORG> They also contend that unlike other mortgagees they have a special right by reason of sections of the <ORG> Act of taking possession of the assets and realising them by sale transfer and so on Finally counsel for the <ORG> urge that the view we are to take would obliterate the difference between a creditor opting to stay outside up and one who opts to prove his debts in winding up This impediment is of a limited nature for the specific purpose of protecting the pari passu charge of the workmen dues and subject thereto <ORG> can continue to exercise their statutory rights as secured creditors without being reduced to the status of unsecured creditors required to prove their debts in insolvency and stand in line with other unsecured creditors The right unilaterally exercisable under section of the SFC Act is available against a debtor if a company only so long as there is no order of winding up
