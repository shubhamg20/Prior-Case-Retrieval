Two main points have been argued before us the first which goes to the root of the whole matter being that this <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain any such petition on the ground that the Chief Judge of the Small Cause <ORG> is not a <ORG> subject to the machinery of the Code of Civil Procedure but a persona designata whose decison is not only not appealable but cannot be called up in revision Section of the Act procides that the Governor in Council may make rules which may provide for the adjudication by the <ORG> of Small Causes of disputes arising out of elections In our opinion elections within the meaning of that section means completed elections which have resulted in the creation of a councillor and does not cover disputes arising before such election but though Rule with which we are primarily concerned purports to be made under Section we are of opinion that it is rendered valid by a generality of the powers conferred on the Governor in Council by Section of the Act and that the rule is not vitiated by its description as having been made under a section which is not applicable Rule gives power to a registered voter to make an objection to the list of candidates and in such a case it is argued that the Chief Judge acting under Rule is in effect <ORG> functioning through him alone and that his decision is therefore subject to revision That rule runs as follows The Judges may sit apart or together at any time and any one or more of the Judges so sitting apart shall have all the judicial authority which is given to the Court by the principal Act or any other enactment for the time being in force except in cases in which by such Act or other enactment or any rule or order having the force of law such powers are exercisable only by two or more Judges of the Court or only by the Chief Judge We are of opinion that this rule only applies to cases where the reference made by the Act or rule in question is clearly to the <ORG> though functioning through the Chief Judge and that it leaves untouched the real question which we have to decide namely whether this power was conferred by Rule made under the Municipal Act upon the Chief Judge as the <ORG> functioning through himself or upon him as persona designata That being so we have no jurisdiction to entertain this revision petition and it must be dismissed with costs
