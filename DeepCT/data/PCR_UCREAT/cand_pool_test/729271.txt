Any welfare legislation when enforced strictly is likely to cause some hardship to one person or the other having interest in the property sought to be subjected to the rigour of such legislation Against the said order the th respondent filed A No of before the Chief Judge <ORG> and sought interim orders suspending the order of restoration but the same was dismissed In the rejoinder it is also stated that respondents to filed declarations and <ORG> <ORG> rd respondent sent up a report and entertaining the application for exemption the <ORG> exercising its powers under section a and of the Act granted permission for alienating the land in favour of the th respondents should construct a Nursing Home However after coming to know of the same from the rejoinders filed by the respondents the petitioner has filed this writ petition In the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition it is also further alleged that the respondents have obtained the exemption by making misrepresentation and playing fraud on the <ORG> <NAME> towards advance for the purchase of her house at Padmarao Nagar for the purpose of the present transaction and made the <ORG> believe that there is an oral agreement dated Accordingly they played fraud on the <ORG> and other concerned authorities in making them believe that there was an agreement on and therefore the order itself is a nullity In its counter affidavit it is mainly stated that the petitioner has no locus standi to question the granting exemption and that even assuming that the petitioner is a tenant he is not entitled to hold the excess land Coming to the allegation of fraud it is stated by the th respondent that the advance of Rs It is also further alleged that there were two transactions between the th respondent and respondents to and it is open to them to adjust money from one transaction to the other and therefore the writ petition is liable to be dismissed The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has locus standi to question the inasmuch as he has an interest as a person holding the land and the petitioner being a company promoting industry can have a reasonable expectation of the same land being allotted to it by the <ORG> at the stage of distribution of the excess The further submission is that as the petitioner would be prejudicially affected inasmuch as it is thrown to the jeopardy of being evicted from the premises and that it also should have been heard by the <ORG> before granting exemption and that therefore there is violation of principles of natural justice The learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submits that the petitioner has no locus standi even to file a writ petition questioning the and therefore there is no question of giving any opportunity of being heard and there is no violation of principles of natural justice We shall first consider the question of locus standi both from the point of view of moving the <ORG> and the right of being heard A preliminary objection was taken that he had no locus standi to file the writ petition because his rights in any manner were not affected by the granting of the no objection certificate Considering the same <ORG> held thus According to most English decisions in order to have the locus standi to invoke certiorari jurisdiction the petitioner should be an aggrieved person and in a case of defect of jurisdiction such a petitioner will be entitled to a writ of certiorari as a matter of course but if he does not fulfil that character and is a stranger the <ORG> will in its discretion deny him this extraordinary remedy save in very special circumstances This takes us to the further question who is an aggrieved person And what are the qualifications requisite for such a status The expression aggrieved person denotes an elastic and to an extent an elusive concept It cannot be confined within the bounds of a rigid exact and comprehensive definition At best its features can be described in a broad tentative manner Its scope and meaning depends on diverse variable factors such as the content and intent of the statute of which contravention is alleged the specific circumstances of the case the nature and extent of the petitioner interest and the nature and extent of the prejudice or injury suffered by him To distinguish such applicants from strangers among them some broad tests may be deduced from the conspectus made above Their efficacy varies according to the circumstances of the case including the statutory context in which the matter falls to be considered These are Whether the applicant is a person whose legal right has been infringed Has he suffered a legal wrong or injury in the sense that his interest recognised by law has been prejudicially and directly affected by the act or omission of the authority complained of Is he a person who has suffered a legal grievance a person against whom a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him of something or wrongfully refused him something or wrongfully affected his title to something Has he a special and substantial grievance of his own beyond some grievance or inconvenience suffered by him in common with the rest of the public Was he entitled to object and be heard by the authority before it took the impugned action If so was he prejudicially affected in the exercise of that right by the act of usurpation of jurisdiction on the part of the authority Is the statute in the context of which the scope of the words person aggrieved is being considered a social welfare measure designed to lay down ethical or professional standards of conduct for the community Or is it a statute dealing with private rights of particular individuals Applying these tests their Lordships dismissed the writ petition holding that the stand taken by the petitioners viz the cinema theatre owner that the setting up of a rival cinema house in the town will adversely affect his monopolistic commercial interest cannot be countenanced as granting such a licence is not wrongful inasmuch as it does not result in injury to a legal right or a legally protected interest the business competition causing it being a lawful activity There is now a clear trend on the part of the <ORG> enlarging the scope of rule of locus standi In <ORG> <NAME> their Lordships held that the workers of a company are entitled to appear at the hearing of the winding up petition whether to support or to oppose it so long as no winding up order is made by the <ORG> and that the workers have a locus to appear and be heard in the winding up petition both before the winding up petition is admitted and an order for advertisement is made as also after the admission and advertisement of the winding up petition until an order is made for winding up the company It is true that there are rules made by this <ORG> prescribing the procedure for moving this <ORG> for relief under Art As already mentioned he has also filed a suit in <ORG> in which he can urge all his rights and he can also raise all his defences in the rent control proceedings The learned counsel submits that the petitioner is a tenant and he by virtue of this is thrown open to the jeopardy of eviction Further there are certain other circumstances also which would show that the petitioner does not come under that category of persons who can be said to have suffered some civil consequences so as to hold that he is a really aggrieved person and therefore he must be heard by the Government There are two pending proceedings in <ORG> No of is a suit filed by <ORG> for an injunction restraining the th respondent herein from trespassing the suit premises and for a mandatory injunction for removing the construction already made The record shows that the petitioner had full knowledge of the exemption by the date these proceedings are initiated The present writ petition is filed in the year though the petitioner had full knowledge about the exemption even in the year reads thus For the purposes of this section and sections and a person shall be deemed to hold any land on which there is a building whether or not with a dwelling unit therein if he i owns such land or the building or ii owns such land but possesses the building or possesses such land and the building the possession in either case being as a tenant under a lease the unexpired period of which is not less than ten years at the commencement of this Act or as a mortgagee or under an irrevocable power of attorney or a hire purchase agreement or partly in one of the said capacities and partly in other of the said capacity or capacities or iii xxx xxx xxx xxx A careful reading of this provision shows that a person shall be deemed to hold any land on which there is a building and the land referred to in clause ii of the explanation applies to a land on which there is a building and the adjacent land Therefore the contention that the Act does not apply to a land on which there is a building and a vacant site in the possession of a tenant is untenable By a letter dated the petitioner company informed <NAME> that they had no objection to his enclosing sq Under these circumstances the petitioner cannot as a matter of right claim that he has suffered a legal injury and consequently he has a right of being heard even at the time of passing the more so when his rights as a tenant if any are not taken away by the impugned Hitherto the view was that only an aggrieved person alone is entitled to a writ of certiorari and if he is a stranger the <ORG> will in its discretion deny the remedy In the real sense an aggrieved person is understood to be one who has a grievance because an order been made prejudicial to his interest and locus standi is generally understood to mean legal capacity to challenge an act or decision The Supreme <ORG> hitherto laid down in many cases that in order to have the locus standi to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article an applicant should ordinarily be one who has a personal or individual right in the subject matter of the application though in the case of some of the writs like habeas corpus or quo warranto this rule is relaxed or modified But it is also pointed out that this rule is flexible enough to take in those cases where the applicant has been prejudicially affected by an act or omission of an authority even though he has no proprietary or even a fiduciary interest in the subject matter The learned Judge however observed thus The first category has as it were two concentric zones a solid central zone of certainty and a grey outer circle of lessening certainty in a sliding centrifugal scale with an outermost nebulous fringe of uncertainty Applicants falling within the central zone are those whose legal rights have been infringed Such applicants undoubtedly stand in the category of persons aggrieved In the grey outer circle the bounds which separate the first category from the second intermix interfuse and overlap increasingly in a centrifugal direction This category of persons falling under the grey outer circle may have the locus standi to move the <ORG> but it cannot be held that they have also a right to be heard before the authority passes the order In <NAME> case Judges transfer case supra their Lordships held that the practising lawyers have a vital interest in the independence of judiciary and if any unconstitutional or illegal action is taken by the <ORG> or any public authority which has the effect of impairing the independence of the judiciary they would certainly be interested in challenging the constitutionality or legality of such action the legal capacity to challenge the act or order but he may not have the right to be heard by the authority at the time of passing the impugned order For the purpose of principles of natural justice the question that matters is whether any legal power has been exercised over the person affecting his legal rights and not whether he has some legal right to move the <ORG> No doubt there is a clear discernible trend enlarging the rule of locus standi But their Lordships did not go to the extent of laying down that every member of the public who is competent to move the <ORG> also automatically has a right to be heard by the decision making authority before doing the act or passing the impugned order It is pertinent to note that the counsel in the Judges transfer case supra also did not go to the extent of seriously contending that they had also a right to be heard by the authority before any transfer of a Judge is made If the tenant or any other member of the public has locus standi to question the action of the <ORG> on the ground that there is a specific legal injury suffered by a person or a class or group of persons for whose benefit the Act is intended then they fall in the grey outer circle the bounds of which separate the first category viz The grievance of the persons aggrieved whose interests are substantially affected is not the same as that of the members of the public who can maintain a legal action Their Lordships noted that there is no provision for inviting objections before the grant of permanent or a quasi permanent cinema licence and there is no provision in the Madhya Pradesh Act or rules which requires advertisement of such an application inviting objections and consideration of the objections before grant of a cinema licence On the question whether any member of the public objecting to such a licence would also be heard at the time of granting licence their Lordships observed thus When the present appellants objected to the renewal of a quasi permanent cinema licence it was not the stage for grant of no objection certificate but it was the stage of renewal of quasi permanent licence subsequent to the stage of granting of a no objection certificate when there was no statutory obligation on the licensing authority to invite objections nor were the appellants entitled to file objections and nor were they entitled to be heard Therefore at that stage there is no question of giving a notice to the petitioner by the Government As discussed earlier he may have locus standi to question the by filing this writ petition as a person having interest in the matter but that locus standi by itself does not give him a right to be heard by the Government before passing the Yet another submission on the same lines is that the petitioner is thrown to the jeopardy of eviction and therefore he is prejudicially affected and that he has a legitimate interest in the vacant land because he has a reasonable expectation of the excess land being allotted to the petitioner company which is promoting trade and industry which also subserve the common good Re <ORG> All ER is yet another case wherein it is held that hearing should be given to all those affected by granting or refusing applications for licences These are all cases where persons have direct and substantial interest in the matter and are affected by the act of the authority For all these reasons we are not able to agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner that there is violation of the principles of natural justice In the preamble it is noted thus A large number of cases have been brought to the notice of State Government where some persons have entered into agreements to sell their urban lands to certain Housing Co operative Societies individuals etc after taking considerable amounts as advances and also obtained permission under the Andhra Pradesh Vacant Lands in Urban Areas Prohibition of Alienation Act to alienate the land but could not register the sale deeds as the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act came into force in the meanwhile With a view to avoid hardship and civil litigation in recovery of the amounts advanced if transactions are not finalised many requests have been made by the transferors as well as transferees that such land may be exempted from the provisions of Chapter III of Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act so that the sale deeds for the lands so transferred may be registered in favour of the transferees in accordance with the agreement already entered into Merely because there is a reference to the cheque in the agreement it does not matter at all when once both parties have agreed that the particular advance is made through that cheque Therefore the purchase of the stamps on which the agreement was engrossed cannot be doubted and when there is a mention about the cheque in that and when in fact the cheque has been encashed by the owners that is sufficient proof so far as the <ORG> is concerned Further there is a report of the Special Officer in this regard Therefore it cannot be said that there is no enquiry at all and that the <ORG> arbitrarily granted the exemption The object underlying the Act viz But at the same time it has also kept in view the object of the Act in granting exemption Therefore according to the learned counsel with a view to make it appear that the agreement dated regarding the sale of the vacant land in question is a genuine one and to satisfy the requirements of Ms Before we take up the plea of the respondents we shall consider the principles of law governing a case of fraud In his classic book Administrative Law Fifth Edition <NAME> referred to <NAME> <NAME> observations in <NAME> Estates case supra and at page noted thus In administrative law which was not the context of this statement there is only scanty material to illustrate it although in principle it ought to be correct The only field in which there are examples is immigration law where it is held that leave to enter given by an immigration officer is vitiated if it has been obtained by any kind of fraud deception or mis representation on the part of the immigrant <ORG> has gone so far as to hold in an exceptional decision that an immigrant has a positive duty to disclose all material facts even if he is not asked about them and that if he fails to volunteer relevant information he is guilty of deception and his leave to enter is nullity Fraud and perjury An order of certiorari may be made to quash an order which has been obtained by fraud as where an untrue charge has been knowingly made by the prosecutor or by means of collusion between the parties and it seems where the decision was made on the strength of perjured evidence but it appears that the court will not quash the order unless it is satisfied that the person in whose favour the order was made could have been convicted of the fraud or perjury whereby the decision was procured In <NAME> Judicial Review of Administrative Action Fourth Edition at page the paragraph dealing with Fraud or Collusion is in the following terms The superior courts have an inherent jurisdiction to set aside order and convictions made by inferior tribunals if they have been procured by fraud or collusion The Home Officer refused extension and he appealed to an adjudicator who formed the view that the leave was granted to the appellant due to his deception and therefore he was an illegal entrant and should be removed from the United Kingdom And in the ultimate appeal to the Court Lord <NAME> while allowing the appeal observed thus Coming back to what I said at the beginning the deception must be of decisive character The allegations made by the petitioner regarding the alleged fraud are contradicted When there are two transactions between the same parties it is open to them to adjust the money from one transaction to the other provided the entire consideration under both the transactions is received by the owners In the registered sale deed dated under which the th respondent sold the Padmaraonagar house property it is mentioned that the vendee agrees to purchase the property by virtue of an agreement of sale dated whereupon he paid by a cheque an advance amount of Rs In the agreement of sale dated regarding the sale of the vacant land in question it is mentioned that the purchasers have offered to purchase building No along with appurtenant land admeasuring about sq In the agreement of sale dated referred to above there is a reference to the cheque No dated for Rs It is stated that there were two oral agreements entered into on one for the Sangeet Theatre property i the building and land under the possession of the tenant through cheque No dated for Rs dated was issued that as there was not enough money in the bank a request was made to the owner not to present the cheque and in the meanwhile the purchasers paid Rs The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the explanation is belated and it does not fit in with the averments made in the earlier counter affidavit It must be pointed out at this stage that the fraud alleged must be proved positively That there are two transactions is not in dispute The parties have agreed before the <ORG> that there was such a transaction It is on the same stamp papers that the agreement in question was engrossed and there is a reference to cheque No Even in the original counter there is no reference to a particular cheque No When there are two transactions as to how the parties adjusted the advances in respect of them is not a matter concerned with third parties <NAME> and there is a reference to this cheque in the agreement It may be as explained by the respondents that this cheque was used towards advance of sale consideration of the land in question and by way of an adjustment and accommodation another cheque bearing No was issued with a request not to present the same for encashment and with a promise to pay the cash as against the cheque soon and on according to the respondents they paid Rs But the two sons and the wife of late Sri <NAME> who had a major interest in the property in question and who had entered into an agreement to sell the land had every right to apply for exemption Wherein it is held that opportunity of being heard should be given to a claimant before rejecting an application under section of the Act That does not in any way affect the interests of the th respondent petitioner herein nor restrict her rights to deal with her property as she likes
