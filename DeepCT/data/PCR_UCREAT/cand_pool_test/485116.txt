Seniority and promotion Direct recruits and promotees interse seniority To be counted from date of appointment not confirmation Ad hoc appointment Officia tion in such post Cannot be taken into account for consid ering seniority In Rules were made for regulating the methods of recruitment to the said services which directed the recruit ment to be made either by nomination from amongst the stu dents of <ORG> Pune or by promotion of officers holding inferior posts Rule thereof was to the effect that in case of officers promoted to substantive vacancies the seniority would be determined with reference to the date of their promotion to the substantive vacancies These appointments were made after following the procedure applicable to regular promo tions including consultation with the Public Service Com mission The strength of the permanent Deputy Engineers was fixed at the total number of a the Deputy Engineers con firmed up to the date of commencement of the Rules direct recruits to the posts of Deputy Engineers appointed till the date of commencement of the Rules and the Deputy Engineers officiating on and it was pro vided that no fresh appointments in future would be made to this cadre and the vacancies arising would be transferred to the officers holding subordinate posts detailed in the sub rule in proportions indicated Since the direct recruits were all appointed against the permanent posts they were reckoned to be senior to the officiating Deputy Engineers irrespective of the period for which they had been working continuously on the Deputy Engineer posts Though the Rules were amend ed in there was no departure from the main scheme especially the principle governing seniority For the purpose of fixing the seniority of Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers for the period commencing from separate rules were framed under Article of the Constitution and are called the Executive Engi neers and Assistant Engineers belonging to the Maharashtra Service of Engineers Class I and the Maharashtra Service of Engineers Class II Regulation of Seniority and Preparation and Revision of Seniority Lists Rules But if the appointment is made after considering the claims of all eligible candidates and the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules made for regular substantive appointments there is no reason to exclude the officiating service for purpose of seniority The expression has been used in the sense of confirmation Rules and of the Rules mention only cadres in Class II namely those of Sub Divisional Officers Sub Divisional Engineers Assistant Engineers Class II and Deputy Engineers and there was no separate cadre of officiating Deputy Engi neers There is no reason to so restrict the scope and meaning of the expression as far as practicable If appointments from one source are made in excess of the quota but in a regular manner and after following the prescribed procedure there is no reason to push down the appointees below the recruits from the other source who are inducted in the Service subsequently Avoiding the details the position may be briefly stated by dividing the entire period into sub periods and mentioning the scope of such of the provisions of the rules which have direct bear ing on the questions involved in the present cases In Rules were made for regulating the methods of recruit ment to the said Services which directed the recruitment to be made either by nomination from amongst the students of <ORG> Pune or by promotion of officers holding inferior posts Rule said that in case of officers promoted to substantive vacancies the seniority would be determined with reference to the date of their promotion to the substantive vacancies These appointments were made after following the procedure applicable to regular promo tions including consultation with the Public Service Com mission By the strength of the permanent Deputy Engineers was fixed at the total number of a the Deputy Engineers confirmed up to the date of commencement of the Rules direct recruits to the posts of Deputy Engineers appointed till the date of commencement of the Rules and the Deputy Engi neers officiating on and it was provided that no fresh appointments in future would be made to this cadre and the vacancies arising would be transferred to the officers holding subordinate posts detailed in the sub rule in pro portions indicated It said that the seniority list in each cadre in Class I and Class II shall be prepared in two parts one for the confirmed officers and other for those who were not confirmed and that the confirmed officers would be treated as senior to the unconfirmed officers Since the direct recruits were all appointed against the permanent posts they were reckoned to be senior to the officiating Deputy Engineers irrespective of the period for which they had been working continuously on the Deputy Engineer posts These Rules were amended in but there was no departure from the main scheme and the princi ple governing seniority In view of the judgment in <NAME> case it became necessary to prepare fresh seniority lists and since the re organised states of Bombay and Gujarat were formed on under the provisions of the State Re organisation Act it was considered expedient to make rules for preparing seniority lists of Deputy Engineers in respect of the period to that is the date immediately after coming into force of the Rules One of the direct recruits <NAME> who was admittedly represented by the petitioner in No of filed an application under Article of the Con stitution before this Court on that is after the dismissal of No of which has been regis tered as No of and is being disposed of by the present judgment In further rules called Re organised Bombay State Assistant Engineers and Executive Engineers Seniority Lists Rules described by the parties as the Rules were flamed laying down the rule of determination of seniority of the Assistant Engineers and the Executive Engineers for the period to The number of vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Engineers in every year during the specified period and in the fractional year shall be deemed to be equal to the number of vacancies actually filled in that year or as the case may be fractional year and the first three fourths of such vacancies in each year or in the fractional year shall be deemed to be allocated for persons recruited directly as Deputy Engineers and the subsequent remaining vacancies in that year or in the fractional year shall be deemed to be allocated for filling by promotions from amongst Overseers who may be eligible for such promo tions in accordance with rules or orders made by <ORG> from time to time during the specified period For the purpose of fixing the seniority of Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers for the period commencing on separate rules were framed under Article of the Constitution and are called the Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers belonging to the Maharashtra Service of Engineers Class I and the Maharashtra Service of Engi neers Class II Regulation of Seniority and Preparation and Revision of Seniority Lists Rules and will be re ferred to hereafter as the Rules When the cases were taken up for hearing before us it was faintly suggested that the principle laid down in <NAME> case was unsound and fit to be over ruled but no attempt was made to substantiate the plea We were taken through the judgment by the learned counsel for the parties more than once and we are in complete agreement with the ratio decidendi that the period of continuous officiation by a government servant after his appointment by following the rules applicable for substantive appointments has to be taken into account for determining his seniority and seniority cannot be determined on the sole test of confirmation for as was pointed out confirmation is one of the inglorious uncer tainties of government service depending neither on effi ciency of the incumbant nor on the availability of substan tive vacancies The principle for deciding inter se seniori ty has to conform to the principles of equality spelt out by articles and But if the appointment is made after considering the claims of all eligible candidates and the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules made for regular substantive appointments there is no reason to exclude the officiating service for purpose of seniority Same will be the position if the initial appointment itself is made in accordance with the rules applicable to substantive appointments as in the present case There is considerable force in this view also It is claimed that if the relevant position is correctly appreciated there is no escape but to hold that the Rules excepting iii and the Rules except were perfectly legal and the declaration about their invalidity was erroneous Rule according to the appel lants therefore makes a clear distinction between the two groups which could not be lumped together Reliance was also placed on the language of rr The expression there has been used in the sense of confir mation Rules and of the Rules mention only cadres in Class II namely those of Sub Divisional Officers Sub Divisional Engineers Assistant Engineers Class II and Deputy Engineers and there was no separate cadre of officiating Deputy Engineers This question was considered in <NAME> case at considerable length and a categorical finding against the direct recruits was arrived at which has been followed for the last more than a decade in many cases arising between members of Maharashtra and <ORG> Their contention was that under the rules in force the respond ents who were in substantive rank of Overseers were only officiating Deputy Engineers and that as they did not belong to the cadre of Deputy Engineers they were not entitled to promotion inasmuch as they had to put in after confirmation as Deputy Engineers years of actual service before being eligible for promotion as officiating Executive Engineers This decision was challenged before this Court and it was held by the judgment in the reported case that the respondent was not entitled to count his experience as officiating Deputy Engineer before his selection as a direct entrant in the Service In this set up and for the purpose of construing and considering the necessary qualification for promotion as an Executive Engineer it was observed that the direct recruits and the promotees in Class II constituted two groups or classes and it was pointed out that unless the pre selection service as officiating Deputy Engineer of direct recruits was excluded for reckoning the years experience it would create two classes amongst the same group of direct recruits and result in discrimination against those direct recruits who had no such pre selection service to their credit Even on an independent consideration of the provi sions of the Rules the relevant materials and the arguments addressed on behalf of the parties we are of the view that the temporary posts of Deputy Engineers against which promo tees officiated did not form a separate cadre and were additions to the main cadre Mr <NAME> on the other hand argued that some fresh materials have come to light since after the judgment in <NAME> case which had not been made available by the <ORG> earlier There is serious controversy as to the interpretation of these documents alleged to have been later discovered by the direct recruits and in our opinion they do not furnish any evidence of substantial nature to outweigh the materials produced by the <ORG> in <NAME> case including the aforementioned resolutions About the rule applying at the stage of appointment and not at the stage of confirmation as was held in the said judgment it was suggested that the observations cannot be legitimately interpreted as setting the officiating Deputy Engineers free of the principle of quota The statutory rules which were holding the field earlier did not fix any ratio between the direct recruits and the promotees The case of the appellants is that the said ex pression was inserted in the Proviso with the object of avoiding fractions in arithmetical calculations of number of posts available to the two groups and for no other purpose We do not see any reason to so restrict the scope and mean ing of the expression as far as practicable It will bear repetition that the promotees were not appointed in a casual manner the Rules applicable for substantive appointments were meticulously followed and eligible officers were subjected to all the tests including scrutiny by <ORG> before they were promoted Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondents argued that having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances there is no escape from the conclu sion that the quota rule spelt out by the executive instruc tions in the Rules had in fact collapsed and that this fact can be recognised even without issuing a formal amend ing instruction It is permissible to draw an inference to that effect by the steps taken by the <ORG> <ORG> repeatedly and for a considerable period in disregard of such a rule and specially so where the quota is not fixed in imperative terms The question however is as to what is the conclusion if the quota rule is not followed at all continuously for a number of years after it becomes impossible to adhere to the same There is no sense in asking the perform ance of something which has become impossible The unavoidable situation brings about its natural demise and there is no meaning in pretending that it is still vibrant with life In such a situation if appointments from one source are made in excess of the quota but in a regular manner and after following the prescribed procedure there is no reason to push down the appointees below the recruits from the other source who are inducted in the Service subse quently The later appointees may have been young students still prosecuting their studies when the appointments from the other source take place and it is claimed on behalf of the respondents that this is the position with respect to many of the direct recruits in the present case and it will be highly inequitable and arbitrary to treat them as senior Mr <NAME> contended that many important observations in those cases also support the respondents on several relevant aspects as for example the statement at pages in the judgment in <NAME> case as reported in SCR to the following effect It is submitted by the respondents that one third quota cannot be filled unless the two third quota was ex hausted That being the situation of all these officers they could hardly contend that the dates of appointments will not be altered for the purposes of determining seniority It has also been alternatively argued on behalf of the appellants that by the statement in the judgment in <NAME> case that the quota rule applied at the stage of appointment and not at the stage of confirmation this Court did not mean to say that those who were promoted in an officiating capacity were not subject to the quota rule Relying upon the observations in the <NAME> case that the quota system was an important feature of the Rules it was contended by Mr <NAME> that it is not permissible to hold that the rule in this regard had been relaxed by the Govern ment or that it had at any point of time broken down This argument as has been addressed before us on the basis of the quota rule as an additional contention was not pressed in <NAME> case and so there was no occasion for this Court to deal with the same The observations referred to by Mr <NAME> were made in a different context altogether The appellants by trying to interpret a part of the observation made in the judgment in a different context in an artificial and uncalled for manner are suggesting that the judgment is self contradic tory but we do not find any justification for such an inference and undone the inequality inequity and illegality which were the products of the offending provisions of the earlier Rules and there is no reason whatsoever to doubt their validity So far Mr <NAME> who appeared on behalf of the <ORG> of Maharashtra is concerned he faintly de fended all the steps of the <ORG> taken from time to time and made certain statements which were criticised on behalf of the appellants in the Civil Appeals as amounting to Unjustified concessions in favour of the promotees Since we have not gone by the stand taken on behalf of the <ORG> of Maharashtra before us during the argument and our decision is based on a consideration of the merits of the different questions argued by the parties and not on any concession we do not consider it necessary to deal with Mr <NAME> argument at any length He prayed for a direction to the authorities to frame fresh rules including appropriate provisions on the lines suggested by him In view of our finding that the Rules as amended by the Rules do not suffer from any infirmity there is no occasion for issuing any further direction He has of course challenged the Rules as they stood before the amendment in but did not after amendment make any prayer for modification of his writ petition It has been stated in his petition that although some junior officers were promoted as Executive Engineers earli er his promotion was delayed and took place in October We do not find any merit in either of the two writ petitions No of and No of pressed by Mr <NAME> These facts were not denied by the petitioner before us and it was therefore contended on behalf of the respondents that so far the validity of the Rules is concerned it must be held to be binding on the petitioner in respect of iden tical relief now pressed by him in the present writ case <NAME> and Others SCC further clarified the position by holding that an adjudica tion is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had decided as incidental to or essentially connected with subject matter of the litigation and every matter coming into the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim and defence We have considered the arguments carefully and do not find any substance in the claim of the petitioner and we proceed to indicate our reasons briefly It has been con tended by him that he was entitled to the benefit of either the Rules or the provision relating to quota in Rules and in either event he Reliance was placed on the observations in <NAME> SCR This argument precisely was rejected in <NAME> case and we are in complete agreement with the same We also do not accept the argument of the petitioner that the judg ment did not deal with the Rules It has to be remembered that the Rules made under an executive instruction do not stand on a stronger footing than the provisions of the subsequent similar Rules which have been struck down on the ground of illegal discrimina tion and as in the case of the and the Rules the Rules also were framed under Article of the Consti tution We do not find any merit in any of the submissions addressed by the petitioner At the same examination <NAME> respondent No who was an officiating Deputy Engineer also appeared and was appointed a Deputy Engineer as a direct recruit and his name appeared in the list below the petitioners It is stated in paragraph of the writ petition that the petitioner No was temporarily dropped in this promotion order on administrative grounds It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that these lists correctly placed the respondent No below the peti tioners but the subsequent lists prepared in pursuance of the Rules wrongly show him as senior We do not find any merit in the challenge to the Rules as indicated earlier and in that view these writ petitions are fit to be rejected specially as the respondent No has already retired The corollary of the above rule is that where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stop gap arrangement the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for considering the seniority When appointments are made from more than one source it is permissible to fix the ratio for recruitment from the different sources and if rules are framed in this regard they must ordinarily be followed strictly In case however the quota rule is not followed continuously for a number of years because it was impossible to do so the inference is irresistible that the quota rule had broken down Where the quota rule has broken down and the appoint ments are made from one source in excess of the quota but are made after following the procedure prescribed by the rules for the appointment the appointees should not be pushed down below the appointees from the other source inducted in the service at a later date Where the rules permit the authorities to relax the provisions relating to the quota ordinarily a presumption should be raised that there was such relaxation when there is a deviation from the quota rule In view of the above and the other findings recorded earli er we do not find any merit in any of the civil appeals writ petitions and special leave petitions which are accord ingly dismissed
