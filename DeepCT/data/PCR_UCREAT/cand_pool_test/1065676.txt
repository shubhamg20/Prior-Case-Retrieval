The first relates to the true meaning of the word information in section of the Income Tax Act hereinafter called the Act in short The petition raising these questions is filed by the petitioner who belonged to the former <ORG> was a former Chief Justice of <ORG> and is now a retired Judge of <ORG> on the following facts The petitioner took a loan of Rs He sold the said house in for Rs As the petitioner parted with the possession of the house contrary to rule of the Indian Civil Service Provident Fund Rules hereafter called the Rules in short the sum withdrawn by him became payable together with interest thereon amounting to Rs The petitioner paid the amount with interest to his Fund accordingly as expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with the transfer of the house in addition to the cost of acquisition of the said house is expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively in connection with the transfer of the house because under the terms of the advance from the Government this interest was compulsorily payable on the sale of the house so that the capital gain by selling the house could not possibly be earned without making this payment to the Government The Income Tax Officer assessed the income tax on capital gains solely on the basis of the representation made by the petitioner on March however a notice under section of the Act was issued to the petitioner by <ORG> staling that the latter had reason to believe that the petitioner income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment within the meaning of section of the Act His learned counsel <NAME> assisted by <NAME> supported the petition on the following grounds No income has escaped assessment within the meaning of section of the Act because the interest paid by the petitioner on the loan taken from his Provident Fund was paid to the Government It became a part of <ORG> of India that is the property of the Government it was therefore expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with the transfer of the house within the meaning of section It did not therefore amount to any expenditure by him muchless expenditure incurred in connection with the transfer of the house and On the return and the representation made by the petitioner it was not apparent that the interest which had been paid by the petitioner was in fact credited to his account and the true and correct interpretation of rule was brought to the notice of the I by the Revenue Audit authorities as well as by <ORG> that the petitioner was in law not entitled to deduction of the amount of interest paid The first question is whether the notice under section read with section was issued with jurisdiction This averment is substantiated by the representation made by the petitioner at the time of the original assessment Neither in the petition nor in the argument was any explanation given as to why the petitioner told the Income Tax Officer that the interest was paid to the Government when under rule it was paid to the Fund The representation by the petitioner that it was paid to the Government was not correct As required by rule it was paid to the Fund It is also necessary to ensure that the Income Tax Officer is not able to ascribe the information about the law given to him subsequent to the assessment to any person whatever It would then be difficult to know whether it was his own re thinking or it really came to him from some person who either had the power or the duty to give such information in the form of an opinion to the Income Tax Officer The question was answered in the negative by <ORG> of <ORG> in the following words at page of the report THE audit department is not an authority competent and authorised to declare the correct state of the law or to pronounce upon it If by the words declare the correct state of the law or to pronounce upon it is meant the authoritative decision of law which is binding on parties courts and other authorities then such authority is possessed only by the courts or other statutory authorities empowered to decide questions of law This raises the question whether the test of the externality of the source of information laid down by <ORG> in <ORG> referred to above is not being unduly circumscribed by these words Under Article the President has made rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of <ORG> and for the allocation among Ministers of the said business Under the said rule the function of advising the <ORG> on all questions of law is given to <ORG> On the first question therefore our finding is that the Income Tax Officer received information within the meaning of section of the Act when subsequent to the assessment <ORG> and the Revenue Audit pointed out that as a question of fact the payment of interest by the petitioner was made to his own account in the Provident Fund and as a question of law the money so paid did not vest in the Government but continued to belong to the petitioner and therefore the income of the petitioner had escaped assess ment which was made on the basis that such payment of interest had amounted to an expenditure incurred by the petitioner in connection with the transfer of his house The Income Tax Officer had therefore jurisdiction to issue the impugned notice under section read with section of the Act Under Article all moneys received by or deposited with a any officer connected with the affairs of the <ORG> or of a <ORG> in his capacity as such other than revenues or public moneys raised or received by <ORG> or the Government of the <ORG> as the case may be or any court within the territory of India to the credit of any cause matter account of persons shall be paid into the public account of India or the public account of the <ORG> as the case may be There is no such requirement for payment of the moneys from the public account There was thus no expenditure at all incurred by him in making the said payment The finding of law is that the payment into the petitioner account in <ORG> does not amount to a payment to the Government and is not an expenditure incurred in connection with the transfer of his house within the meaning of section of the Act The finding on this second question means that even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that our finding on the first question is incorrect and section does not cover the proposed reassessment still the <ORG> would have the discretion to refuse relief to the petitioner The deduction was allowed to the petitioner without further inquiry because of his statement that the interest was paid to the <ORG> while in fact it was paid to his account in the Fund On the facts stated there was a prima facie case to show that the said order might not be supported by section of the Minimum Wages Act But their lordships observed in paragraph of the judgment WE do not propose to decide this question of jurisdiction Their Lordships further observed in paragraph THERE are moreover special reasons why we should not interfere with the orders of the Deputy Commissioner Sibsagar <ORG> had the power to refuse the writs if is was satisfied that there was no failure of justice and in these appeals which are directed against the orders of <ORG> in applications under Article we could refuse to interfere unless we are satisfied that the justice of the case requires it <NAME> State oi Bihar Civil Appeal No of decided on September as follows IT is well settled that under Article the power of <ORG> to issue an appropriate writ is discretionary There can be no doubt that if a citizen moves <ORG> under Article and contends that his fundamental rights have been contravened by any executive action <ORG> would naturally like to give relief to him but even in such a case if the petitioner has been guilty of laches and there are other relevant circumstances which indicate that it would be inappropriate for <ORG> to exercise its high prerogative jurisdiction in favor of the petitioner ends of justice may require that <ORG> should refuse to issue a writ There can be little doubt that if it is shown that a party moving <ORG> under Article for a writ is in substance claiming a relief which under the law of limitation was barred at the time when the writ petition was filed <ORG> would refuse to grant any relief in its writ jurisdiction No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to when <ORG> should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction in favor of a party who moves it after considerable delay and is otherwise guilty of laches That is a matter left to the discretion of the <ORG> in this matter too discretion must be exercised judiciously and reasonably He relies on the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> I There is nothing surprising in the doctrine For the above reasons we dismiss the writ petition with costs
