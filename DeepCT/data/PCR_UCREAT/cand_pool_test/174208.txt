was applicable and if there was any material irregularity in the and if it caused a substantial injury to the judgment debtor aside Where a court mechanically conducts the sale not bothering conduct of the sale the sale could be set to see if the offer is too low and a better price could have been obtained and if in factthe price is substantially inadequate there is both irregularity and injury There is always con siderable difference between the court sale price and market price Further if court sales are too frequently adjourned with a view to obtaining a still higher price prospective bidders will lose faith in the actual sale taking place and may not attend at the auction Nor is it right to judge the unfairness of the price in the light of the subsequentevents which were not within the knowledge of the executing court at the time ofthe sale If the court has fairly applied its mind to the relevant considerations while accepting the final bid it is not necessary to give a speaking order nor can its order be exa mined meticulously All interested parties were present at the auction and no one raised any objection regarding the conduct of the sale The appeal is not against the approval of the sale by the executing court but against <ORG> order in appeal against an order refusing to set aside the sale under Therefore the question of the appellate court power to review the discretion exercised by the trial court does not arise The first respondent which had taken the loan for an industrial purpose defaulted in making repayment and so a notice was issued to it by the fourth respondent the <ORG> under of the State Financial <ORG> Act hereinafter referred to as the Act demanding prompt discharge of the liability under the mortgage and indicating that in default of payment legal proceedings under of the Act to realise the dues would be undertaken No fruitful response was forthcoming and the <ORG> therefore made an application Miscellaneous Application No of in <ORG> against respondents and under of the Act seeking to levy by attachment and sale of the properties covered by the mortgage the amounts due to it There is no doubt that the items sold are of considerable value land in that in dustrial area escalating in price as time passed the machinery being imported and costly and the industry for which they were needed being of growing importance for the country However the judgment debtor moved <ORG> and obtained stay of sale and the appeal was withdrawn by him on February whereupon he filed a suit for declaration that the order for sale was without jurisdiction If court sales are too frequently adjourned with a view to obtaining a still higher price it may prove a self defeating exercise for industrialists will lose faith in the actual sale taking place and may not care to travel up to the place of auction being uncertain that the sale would at all go through On both occasions there were about or bidders lakhs and finalised it taking no chances by adjourning the auction In short was there any material irregularity in the conduct of the sale and did it cause substantial injury to the debtor The first respondent counsel <NAME> drew our attention to condition No in the present proclamation of sale which is as follows The highest bidders for the two lots shall be declared to be the purchasers of the respective lots the sale papers not bothering to see if the offer is too low and a better price could have been obtained and in fact the price is substantially inadequate there is the presence of both the elements of irregularity and injury If the court has fairly even if silently applied its mind to the relevant considerations before him while accepting the final bid no probe in retrospect is permissible However we do not wish to express any opinion because we have no material before us as to what were the circumstances in which <ORG> advanced the loan what were the other securities given by the <ORG> and what was the then worth of the guarantors Nor need we consider the ambit of appellate power to review discretion exercised by the trial court vide <NAME> <NAME> since here we are concerned with no appeal against the approval of the sale by the executing court but with an order refusing to set aside the sale under Order XXI and an appeal therefrom We see no merit in the application to set aside the sale and are constrained to allow the appeal Liberty is given to the <ORG> to withdraw to the extent of its dues with up to date interest We think that the circumstances of the case warrant the direction that parties will bear their costs throughout
