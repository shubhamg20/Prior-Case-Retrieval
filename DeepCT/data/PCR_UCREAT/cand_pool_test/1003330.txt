These appeals are directed against the common judgment and order dated passed by a Division Bench of <ORG> in a batch of writ petitions preferred before it in the years and excepting one in the year whereby declaration under Section of the Land Acquisition Act the Act dated was quashed and the case remitted to <ORG> for further proceedings under two heads After some steps <ORG> issued a notification under Section of the Act on inviting interested persons to file their objections received from interested persons and disposed of by the Additional Land Collector and on report submitted declaration under Section of the Act was made to acquire land to the extent aforementioned except acres which were set apart for allotment to persons likely to be disturbed by the acquisition Section of the Land Acquisition Act as applicable to Bihar provides as follows Sub section Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government or the Collector that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose a notification to that effect shall be published at the office of the Collector at the office of the sub divisional officer at the offices of the smallest revenue administrative unit and <ORG> if any constituted under the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act Bihar Act VII of and at some conspicuous place in the village in which the land is situated and the Collector shall cause copies of the notification to be served on all persons known or believed to be interested in the land Sub section Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer either generally or specially authorised by such Government or the Collector in this behalf and for his servants and workmen to enter upon and survey and take lands of any land in such locality By virtue of Clause of Section the expression Collector means the Collector of a district and includes a Deputy Commissioner Additional Collector Additional Deputy Commissioner and any officer specially appointed by the appropriate Government to perform the functions of a Collector under this Act except the functions under Sections A and Sub section of Section A as in Bihar provides that any person interested in any land which has been notified under Section Sub section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a Company may within thirty days from the date of the publication of the notification referred to in the said sub section at some conspicuous place in the village in which the land is situated or of the service of the copy thereof on him whichever is later object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Sub section substituted in Bihar provides that every objection under Sub section shall be made in writing to the Collector who shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and making such further enquiry if any as he thinks necessary decide the objection Provided that the appropriate Government may either of its own motion or on the application of any person interested in the land call for the record of the proceedings held by the Collector and pass such order as it thinks fit and further that the order of the appropriate Government and subject to such order the decision of the Collector under Clause i shall be final At the pre Section stage besides the mode of publications at various places where the land is situated personal service of the copy of the notification is prominently required to be made oil the person interested so that he can make objections in writing to the Collector and on objections being made the Collector is obliged to give to the objector opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader These requirements obviously lead to the positive conclusion that the proceeding before the Collector is a blend of public and individual enquiry The person interested or known to be interested in the land is to be served personally of the notification giving him the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition and awakening him to such right That the objection is to be in writing is indicative of the fact that the enquiry into the objection is to focus his individual cause as well as public cause That at the time of the enquiry for which prior notice shall be essential the objector has the right to appear in person or through pleader and substantiate his objection by evidence and argument But once Section A is kept applicable there is no cause to treat its provisions lightly or casually The other count on which <ORG> made the remand was the supposal violation of Section of the Act and Rule of the Land Acquisition Companies Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules framed by <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred by Section of the Act It provides that the expression company means a company registered under the Indian Companies Act or under the English Companies Act to or incorporated by an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom or by an Indian law or by Royal Charter or Letters Patent and includes a society registered under the Societies Registration Act and a registered society within the meaning of the Cooperative Societies Act or any other law relating to cooperative societies for the time being in force in any <ORG> Proceedings up to the conclusion of the result of objections under Section A could all the same go on with the <ORG> <ORG> cooperating but the provisions of Section onwards till Section both inclusive can only be deployed in order to acquire land for any company on the satisfaction of two conditions that is i the previous consent of the appropriate <ORG> for the purpose and ii the company having executed the agreement of the kind mentioned in the succeeding Sections Either of the two reports that is one made by the Collector under Sub section of Section A and the other as a result of the deliberations under Section are at par for adoption by the appropriate <ORG> to give consent under Section Thereupon Section mentions that if the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report if any of the Collector under Section A Sub section and there may be none in an urgent acquisition or on the report of the officer making an inquiry under Section that the proposed acquisition is for any of the purposes referred to in Clauses a aa or of Sub section of Section it shall require the company to enter into an agreement with the appropriate <ORG> providing to the satisfaction of the appropriate <ORG> for the following matters namely the payment to the appropriate Government of the cost of the acquisition the transfer on such payment of the land to the company the terms on which the land shall be held by the company where the acquisition is for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses or the provision of amenities connected therewith the time within which the condition on which and the manner in which the dwelling houses or amenities shall be erected or provided A where the acquisition is for the construction of any building or work for a company which is engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work which is for public purpose the time within which and the condition on which the building or work shall be constructed or executed where the acquisition is for the construction of any other work the time within which and the conditions on which the company shall be entitled to use the work And finally Section distinguishes between a private company and a <ORG> company providing that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act no land shall be acquired under this Part except for the purpose mentioned in Clause a of Sub section of Section for a private company which is not a <ORG> company Section defines company to be company formed and registered under the Companies Act or an existing company as defined therein Appropriate Government to be satisfied with regard to certain matters before initiating acquisition proceedings Whenever a Company makes an application to the appropriate Government for acquisition of any land that Government shall direct the Collector to submit a report to it on the following matters namely i that the company has made its best endeavour to find lands in the locality suitable for the purpose of acquisition ii that the company has made all reasonable efforts to get such lands by negotiations with the persons interested therein on payment of reasonable price and such efforts have failed iii that the land proposed to be acquired is suitable for the purpose iv that the area of land proposed to be acquired is not excessive that the company is in a position to utilise the land expeditiously and vi where the land proposed to be acquired is good agricultural land that no alternative suitable site can be found so as to avoid acquisition of the land The Collector shall after giving the company a reasonable opportunity to make any representation in this behalf hold an enquiry into the matters referred to in Sub rule and while holding such enquiry he shall i in any case where the land proposed to be acquired is agricultural and consult the Senior Agricultural Officer of the district whether or not such land is good agricultural land ii determine having regard to the provisions of Sections and of the Act the approximate amount of compensation likely to be payable in respect of the land which in the opinion of the Collector should be acquired for the Company and iii ascertain whether the company offered a reasonable price not being less than the compensation so determined to the persons interested in the land proposed to be acquired No declaration shall be made by the appropriate Government under Section of the Act unless i the appropriate Government has consulted the <ORG> and has considered the report submitted under this rule and the report if any submitted under Section A of the Act and ii the agreement under Section of the Act has been executed by the company Under Rule <ORG> is constituted for the purpose of advising the appropriate <ORG> in relation to acquisition of land under Part VII of the Act which is required to tender its advice within one month from the date of which it is constituted though the time can be extended by two months And lastly <ORG> has concluded that enquiry under Section A was vitiated inasmuch as interested persons were not sent personal notices of the notification as required under the law those who received such notices and had objected were not given proper opportunity of being heard the file of objection summoned revealed a casual observance of the procedure no proper opportunity was given to the objectors to place material before the officer and that when the officer had himself obtained a report of spot inspection he did not given opportunity to the objectors to dispel his impressions thereon The society claims that the possession of the land was given to it on and many plots stood distributed amongst its members by proper registered documents On the latter aspect there was a dispute of fact And delay if any in the facts and circumstances of each case in approaching <ORG> could have had a determinative effect Instantly the Notification under Section is couched in terms that land is required to be taken over by the <ORG> for a public purpose that is for <ORG> on the cost of <ORG> Though Section above quoted requires the appropriate government to notify its intention to acquire land which is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose it nowhere makes it incumbent at that stage to specify as to whether the public purpose would be achieved by some activity of the government or would it be passed over to a company This declaration was in consonance with Sub section of Section as substitutedly applicable in Bihar which is as follows Subject to the provisions of Part VII of the Act where the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied after considering the Collector report if any under the proviso to Sub section of Section A or the Collector is satisfied after hearing the objection if any under Section A particular land is needed for a public purpose or for Company a declaration shall be made by the appropriate <ORG> or the Collector as the case may be to that effect in writing Provided that no such declaration shall be made unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by the <ORG> or wholly or partly out of <ORG> or some fund controlled or managed by a local authority In <NAME> case supra too this Court has taken the view that as provided in Section the machinery of the Land Acquisition Act beginning with Section and ending with Section shall not be put into operation unless two conditions precedent are fulfilled namely i the previous consent of the appropriate government has been obtained and ii an agreement in terms of Section has been executed by the Company Such consent could be given if it was satisfied on the report of the enquiry envisaged by Section A or enquiry held under Section itself that the purpose of the acquisition is for purposes as envisaged in Section As observed earlier we are of the view that <ORG> should not have upset the notification under Section of the Act as a whole and should have individualised justice vis a vis each writ petitioner before it having regard to the equities interplaying in each case and to the regulation of its discretion keeping in view host of other factors which weigh with <ORG> to deny grant or mould relief even when illegalities in procedure keep staring Thus for the view afore expressed we allow these appeals set aside the impugned orders of <ORG> and remit all these matters back to it with the request that though it may take them up as a batch it may give individual attention to each case view the illegalities pointed by the writ petitioner in its right perspective having regard to the time factor and confine the relief if due to him separately We thus remit the matters to <ORG> without any order as to costs
