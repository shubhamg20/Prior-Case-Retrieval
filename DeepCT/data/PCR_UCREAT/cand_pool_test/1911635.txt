This appeal under Clause of the Letters Patent is directed against the order dated December passed by a learned Judge of this Court issuing a Rule Nisi and an interim injunction on a petition under Article of the Constitution of India filed by <ORG> Association for short and its five members Though the Junior Management Staff were kept outside the purview of the lock out the Company did not pay their salaries from November onwards on the plea that there was acute shortage of funds though earlier assurances were given that salaries would be paid soon Thereafter when the petition came up for hearing preliminary objections as to its maintainability were raised on behalf of the <ORG> on the grounds that no writ lay against the <ORG> and even if such writ lay the reliefs sought for in the petition could not be granted as they were for enforcement of a contract of employment First it was contended on behalf of the appellant that by no stretch of imagination could it be said that the Company answered to the definition of State within the meaning of Article of the Constitution of India so as to make it amenable to the writ jurisdiction of <ORG> In elaborating the first contention it was submitted on behalf of the <ORG> that <ORG> through its various decisions had laid down the tests for ascertaining whether a <ORG> was an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> so as to answer to the description of other authorities and for that matter State within the meaning of the Article of the Constitution of India and if the status of the <ORG> was scrutinised in the light of the above tests it would be found that none of them stood satisfied It was pointed out by <ORG> that the finale was reached when their cumulative effect was assessed and once the body was found to be an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> the further conclusion emerged that it was State and subject to the same constituional limitations as <ORG> In <NAME> case supra it was similarly observed that it was not necessary that all the tests should be satisfied for reaching the conclusion either for or against holding an institution to be State and in a given case some of the features might emerge so boldly and prominently that a second view might not be possible but there might be other cases where the matter would be on the border line and it might be difficult to take one view or the other outright When judged in the light of the above tests keeping in view the observation made by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra in the passage quoted earlier that the tests were neither clinching nor conclusive but they were merely indicative indicia which have to be used with care and caution because while stressing the necessity of a wide meaning to be placed on the expression other authorities it must be realised that it should not be stretched so far as to bring in every autonomous body which had some nexus with the <ORG> within the sweep of the expression exphasis supplied the conclusion is inevitable that the appellant Company cannot be brought within the meaning of State under Article of the Constitution As there is no material on record to even indicate far less prove the above ingredient the contention of Mr <NAME> in this regard must be negatived Applications were thereafter filed by <ORG> and <ORG> in <ORG> for award of compensation to the persons who had suffered harm on account of escape of oleum gas One of the questions which arose for consideration at the time of hearing was whether Article of the Constitution was available against <ORG> declared industrial policies was ultimately intended to be carried out by shares and which was engaged in an industry vital to public interest and with potential to affect the life and health of the people Taking aid of the American <ORG> Action doctrine it was also argued on behalf of the applicants that private activity if supported controlled or regulated by the <ORG> might get so entwined with <ORG>al activity as to be termed <ORG> action and it would then be subject to the same constitutional restraints on the exercise of power as the <ORG> In controverting the above contentions it was submitted on behalf of Shriram that control or regulation of a private corporation functions by the <ORG> under general statutory Law such as the Industries Development and Regulation Act was only in exercise of police power of regulation by the <ORG> and such regulation did not convert the activity of the private corporation into that of the <ORG> The <ORG> also took notice of the fact that <ORG> was required to obtain licences under the Factories Act and Delhi Municipal Act and was subject to extensive environment regulation under the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act and Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act that is all such activities which could jeopardise public interest But we do not propose to decide this question and make any definite pronouncement upon it for reasons which we shall point out later in the course of this judgment The <ORG> then proceeded to deal with the other question raised in the case and after answering the same observed in paragraph that since it was not deciding the question as to whether <ORG> was an authority within the meaning of Article so as to be subjected to the I discipline of the fundamental right under Article it did not think it would be justified in setting up a special machinery for investigation of the claims for compensation made by those who alleged that they had been victims of oleum gas escape It is of course true that the appellant Compahy like <ORG> is engaged in an industry which comes under the purview of the first schedule to the Industries Development and Regulation Act and as such the <ORG> has powers to assume management and control of the Company if it is found that its affairs are being managed in a manner detrimental to public interest While on this point we may even at the risk of repetition remind ourselves of the observation made in the case of <NAME> supra that the six tests were to be used with care and caution because while stressing the necessity of a wide meaning to be placed on the expression other authorities it must be realised that it could not be stressed so far as to bring other autonomous body which has some nexus with the <ORG> within the sweep of the expression a wide enlargement of the meaning must be tempered by a wise limitation If merely on the basis of the facts that a Company incorporated under the Companies Act is running a business in any of the industries appearing in the first schedule of the Industries Development and Regulation Act and that for running its business it has obtained loans from financial institution for which such institution has placed a Director in <ORG> an inference that it is an instrumentality or agency of the Government has to be drawn then in that case a private limited company carrying on business in cigarettes which also finds place in the first Schedule of the above Act with <ORG> loan would have to be called an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> The first point raised on behalf of the appellant must therefore succeed In view of that success the other point raised on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal need not be gone into
