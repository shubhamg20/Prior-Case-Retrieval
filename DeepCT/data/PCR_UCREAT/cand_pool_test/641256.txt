Held that according to the course of business usage in general the parties must have intended that cheques should be sent by post and therefore the posting of cheques in Delhi amounted to payment in Delhi to the post office which was constituted the agent of the assesses Being aggrieved by the order of the <ORG> the assessee applied for a reference of the case to <ORG> for the determination of the question of law which arose out of the <ORG> order and the <ORG> agreeing that a question of law did arise out of its order referred the following question to <ORG> along with a statement of the case whether on the facts of the case income profits and gains in respect of sales made to <ORG> was received in British India within the meaning of section a of the Act <ORG> felt that in order to determine this contention it would be necessary for the <ORG> to find certain further facts and accordingly <ORG> remanded the reference back to the <ORG> with a request to submit a supplementary statement of the case on the lines indicated in the order dated the th September That clause also provided Unless otherwise agreed between the parties payment for the delivery of the stores will be made on submission of bills in the prescribed form in accordance with instructions given in the Acceptance of Tender by cheque on <ORG> in India or on a branch of <ORG> or <ORG> transacting Government business On the top of the memo there was a direction that it be immediately returned to the Controller of Supply Accounts with the acknowledgement form on the reverse duly signed and stamped when necessary The conclusion pressed upon us is that as the cheques were received at <ORG> the payment was received there and consequently the assessee which is a non resident company did not receive any income profits or gains in British India within the meaning of section a of the Indian Income tax Act and the referred question should be answered in the negative The passage from paragraph of the supplementary statement of the case and sub paragraphs and of paragraph do tend to suggest that in the view of the <ORG> no payment was made by the <ORG> by merely issuing the cheques that when the assessee received the cheques it did not receive the sale proceeds that it received the sale proceeds subject to the encashment of the cheques that the bank collected the cheques in Bombay as the agent of the assessee and that the sale proceeds were therefore received in cash in Bombay But in view of the language used in the supplementary statement of the case there is ample scope for the view that the portion referred to above do not amount to findings of fact by the <ORG> but on the contrary are only inferences drawn by it from facts found by it Indeed <ORG> was of the opinion that the <ORG> had not in terms come to a finding of fact that the assessee accepted the cheques in complete discharge of its claim for the price of goods supplied by it but on a consideration of the facts actually found by the <ORG> <ORG> came to the conclusion that the necessary inference to be drawn from those facts was that there was an arrangement between the assessee and the <ORG> from which it could be said that the acceptance by the assessee of the cheques from the <ORG> resulted in an uncon ditional discharge of the debt In the circumstances we have to examine the facts found by the <ORG> which have a bearing on this point The assessee contends that on the facts found by the <ORG> it must be held that it received the cheques in full and unconditional discharge of its claims for the price of goods sold and delivered by it to the <ORG> and not conditionally subject to realisation Learned Solicitor General does not dispute this proposition but he argues that in the absence of any agreement express or implied to the contrary a payment by a negotiable instrument is always understood to be conditional He refers us to Benjamin on Sale th Edition page in support of the proposition that the intention to take a bill in absolute payment for goods sold must be clearly shown and not deduced from ambiguous expressions such as that the bill was taken in payment for the goods <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Duke of Argyle or in discharge <NAME> <NAME> or in settlement of the price Re <NAME> and <NAME> Sri <NAME> on the other hand relied on the following facts in answer to the contentions of the learned Solicitor General i that there was an arrangement by the contract itself for payment by cheque clause ii that in the bills submitted by him the assessee expressly asked for payment by cheque iii that the Government sent cheques in payment of the bills iv that on receipt of the cheques the assessee returned the acknowledgement form duly signed and stamped as a formal receipt that the drawer of the cheques was <ORG> and the drawee was <ORG> for whose solvency there could be no apprehension at all in the mind of the assessee Therefore we have in this case according to the learned Solicitor General nothing more than a term in the contract for payment by cheques and the status of the drawer and drawee of the cheques He points out that in this case there is no finding of any special agreement in this behalf and therefore submits the learned Solicitor General the assessee must be taken to have received the cheques conditionally i subject to realisation We find ourselves substantially in agreement with this conclusion It is to be remembered that there are four modes in which a contract may be discharged namely by agreement by performance by being excused by law from performing it and by breach Finally there is no suggestion that any of the cheques was dishonoured on presentation the several facts relied on by him and alluded to above taken cumulatively must lead us to the conclusion that the cheques were received in complete discharge of the claim for the price of the goods Even if we accept his contention that the facts referred to above are not sufficient to raise the implication that the cheques were accepted as payment and even if the sending of the cheques in terms of clause or at the special request of the assessee did not operate as an unconditional discharge of the Government liability even then the assessee position will be no better It is said in Benjamin on Sale th Edition page The payment takes effect from the delivery of the bill but is defeated by the happening of the condition i non payment at maturity <NAME> <NAME> expressed the same idea in the following passage in his judgment at page In this case I think what took place amounted to a conditional payment of the debt the condition Bom The position therefore is that in one view of the matter there was in the circumstances of this case an implied agreement under which the cheques were accepted unconditionally as payment and on another view even if the cheques were taken conditionally the cheques not having been dishonoured but having been cashed the payment related back to the dates of the receipt of the cheques and in law the dates of payments were the dates of the delivery of the cheques On the footing then that the assessee received payment as soon as the cheques were delivered to it the question still remains as to when and where the assessee received such payment In the first place it is said that this is an entirely new question of law which was never raised or argued before the <ORG> and was not dealt with by it and therefore cannot be said to arise out of the <ORG> Order and consequently the Court has no jurisdiction while exercising its advisory jurisdiction under section of the Indian Income tax Act to permit such anew question of law to be raised at this stage In the view we have taken it is not necessary for us on this occasion to express any opinion on the larger question as to the scope meaning and import of the words any question of law arising out of the <ORG> order on the interpretation of which there exists a wide divergence of judicial opinion conditionally and therefore there was no payment until the cheques had been cashed and the cheques having been cashed in Bombay the payment must be regarded as having been received in Bombay That argument did not find favour with <ORG> and that being the position the <ORG> sought to raise before <ORG> as it does before us an alternative argument also based on facts that the cheques having at the request of the assessee been posted at Delhi the mere posting of the cheques in such circumstances operated as payment in Delhi This suggestion means that the question must be read as limited only to those facts on which alone reliance was placed in support of the argument actually advanced before the <ORG> and on which then <ORG> decision was founded leaving out all other facts appearing on the record and even referred to in the <ORG> order and the statements of the case There is no warrant for such suggestion The language of the question clearly indicates that the question of law has to be determined on the facts of this case <ORG> however held that there was no finding by the <ORG> that it point of fact the assessee had ever requested the <ORG> to send the cheques by post and that that being the position it could not be said that the cheques had been delivered to the assessee in Delhi The question for our consideration is as to what on the legal principles laid down in judicial decisions these findings of fact amount to If what the plaintiffs said amounted to a request to send the cheque by the post then there was payment If according to the ordinary course of delivery the carrier would be the person who would receive it that would be just as good for the purpose of the argument as if the carrier had been actually named but we have not to consider that question here because the carrier is named Then for what reason am I to depart from the well known and recog nised principle of law that under these circumstances when goods are delivered by the order of the buyer to a named carrier from that moment the goods vest in the buyer The decision in <NAME> Leyland is very important for our purpose in that it explains the meaning and implication of the word remit which is the word used by the assessee when it requested <ORG> to remit the amount by cheque I think it is impossible on these words to maintain that there was an obligation and a liability incumbent upon him until those bank post bills had reached the hands of the plaintiffs in England We may however point out that this right of the sender on which so much stress and importance are laid by the learned advocate is by no means an absolute right for it is left entirely to the authorities to decide whether a letter once posted should be returned to the sender There can be no doubt that as between the sender and the addressee it is the request of the addressee that the cheque be sent by post that makes the post office the agent of the addressee Apart from this principle of agency there is another principle which makes the delivery of the cheque to the post office at the request of the addressee a delivery to him and that is that by posting the cheque in pursuance of the request of the creditor the debtor performs his obligation in the manner prescribed and sanctioned by the creditor and thereby discharges the contract by such performance see section of the Indian Contract Act and illustration thereto We do not think that there is any basic difference between the two Acts in respect of the matter under discussion According to the course of business usage in general to which as part of the surrounding circumstances attention has to be paid under the authorities cited above the parties must have intended that the cheques should be sent by post which is the usual and normal agency for trans mission of such articles and according to the <ORG> findings they were in fact received by the assessee by post This on the authorities cited above clearly amounted in effect to an express request by the assessee to send the cheques by post We therefore allow the appeal and answer the question accordingly
