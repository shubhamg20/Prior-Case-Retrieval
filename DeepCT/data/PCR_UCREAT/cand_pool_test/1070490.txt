<NAME> I am unable to share the view expressed by him on some points and must respectfully dissent Though the facts and provisions of the relevant law have been set out in the judgment prepared by <NAME> keeping in view of the importance in the matter I propose to refer all the details and deliver a separate judgment in the following terms Leave granted There was no sufficient time given to <ORG> to read the draft On the <ORG> copy was made available to <ORG> for the first time On the <ORG> communicated to the <ORG> its refusal to approve the price of gas agreed between the <ORG> and the <ORG> under the <ORG> However <ORG> would still have to pay the transportation cost for supply to the West Coast even if the facility is not used but will have the right to deal with the capacity as it deems fit and to sell or assign the same to another party In relation to applicable governmental and statutory approvals without in any manner mitigating <ORG> responsibility <ORG> and Reliance <ORG> give an irrevocable Power of Attorney to the Reliance <ORG> to apply for and obtain all such governmental and regulatory approvals as are necessary on its behalf On the second issue <ORG> held as follows i The suitable arrangement was required to be made by engrafting the <ORG> on the <ORG> ii As far as the fixation of price is concerned the <ORG> has the power to fix the price but only for its take of the gas and iii Although the <ORG> could lay down the <ORG> such Utilization Policy would apply only to the gas available for allocation after certain quantity of gas which according to <ORG> stood allocated to <ORG> as per the <ORG> iv There was nothing in the <ORG> that prevented the Contractor from selling gas at a price lower than the price approved by the <ORG> and <ORG> could fulfill its obligation of supply of gas at a price of US per mmbtu Heard M<ORG>s <NAME> and Mr <NAME> Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> M<ORG>s <NAME> and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> and Mr <NAME> learned Solicitor General M<ORG>s <NAME> and Mr <NAME> Additional Solicitor General for <ORG> Historical background Up to the early prior to the <ORG> and pre <ORG> years natural gas was being produced only from the fields operated by the <ORG> companies namely <ORG> in short <ORG> and <ORG> in short <ORG> out of blocks which were given to these companies by the <ORG> on nomination basis this <ORG> affirmed the views expressed in the above cases in the context of electricity supply and also affirmed the <ORG> role in the securing and distributing of the resources of the community that best sub serves the common good There is no unfettered discretion in public law A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is fairplay in action Under the Companies Act there are no provisions except Sections to which deal with the procedure and power of <ORG> to sanction the <ORG> which falls within the ambit of requirements as contemplated under these sections Since the <ORG> Judge as well as <ORG> of <ORG> proceeded on the basis that it has ample power and jurisdiction to supervise the <ORG> as sanctioned under Sections to of the Companies Act it is but proper to refer those sections which are as under Power to compromise or make arrangements with creditors and members

section or to the Central <ORG> and shall take into consideration the representations if any made to it by that <ORG> before passing any order under any of these sections ISSUES ARISING IN THE PRESENT APPEALS a Whether the <ORG> Petition filed by <ORG> under Section of the Companies Act was maintainable Even if the <ORG> Petition was maintainable whether the challenge raised by <ORG> to the <ORG> that it is not a suitable arrangement was maintainable particularly in view of the fact that on merits the <ORG> Judge had found these objections to be unsustainable Whether the <ORG> entered into amongst the family members of the Promoter was binding upon the corporate entity <ORG> Whether the terms of the <ORG> are required to be incorporated in the <ORG> as held by <ORG> Whether the provisions in the <ORG> requiring <ORG> approval for supply of gas to <ORG> is unreasonable and that its inclusion renders the <ORG> as not a suitable arrangement as contended by <ORG> Having insisted upon a Gas Sale and Purchase <ORG> <ORG> in conformity with the <ORG> draft <ORG> dated th May which contained an unequivocal stipulation for <ORG> approval for quantity tenure and price whether it is open to <ORG> to now contend that the <ORG> approval for supply of gas is not required and further that the provision requiring <ORG> approvals should be deleted from the <ORG><ORG><ORG> Whether it is necessary for this <ORG> to go into the interpretation of the provisions of the <ORG> i Whether the approval of the <ORG> is required to the price at which gas is sold by the contractor under the <ORG> ii Whether the <ORG> has the right to regulate the distribution of gas produced which it has exercised by putting in place the <ORG> under which sectoral and consumer wise priorities to the quantities specified have been identified and notified to <ORG> iii <ORG> has argued this because the wording of both the provisions suggests that Section provides much wider power to the <ORG> with respect to making additions in the <ORG> Section applies only to Companies which are re constructing and or amalgamating involving the transfer of assets and liabilities to another <ORG> Section sub section specifically gives <ORG> the power not merely to sanction the compromise or arrangement but also gives <ORG> the power by a subsequent order to make provisions for such incidental consequential and supplemental matters as are necessary to secure that the re construction or amalgamation shall be fully and effectively carried out Section vi Hence the power under Section has to be understood in the above context and is of the same quality as the power expressly given to <ORG> post sanction under Section iii The learned Single Judge founded his power to give relief in the <ORG> Application filed by <ORG> in Section on the ground that the applicants cannot be rendered remediless For this Mr <NAME> pointed out that the <ORG> Judge was not correct for the simple reason that the remedy lies in Section sub clause vi which gives ample power to <ORG> to fully and effectively carry out the scheme governed by the provisions of Section iv It is the claim of the <ORG> that the power to enforce the compromise or arrangement includes the power to make such modifications in the compromise or arrangement as the <ORG> may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or arrangement There is also the question whether the proposals of a person who is not one of those recognised by Section of the Act could be accepted by <ORG> while approving a scheme It was argued on behalf of the respondents that under Section of the Act the court has the power to make modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary and this power would include the power to approve what has been put forward by <ORG> who has come forward to discharge the liabilities of the <ORG> on the rights in the properties of the <ORG> other than in the office building and in the godown being given to it for development and sale As we read Section of the Act it only gives power to the court to make such modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or arrangement We must also remember that at least before us there are serious objections to the modifications by one of the Somanis who are the promoters of the <ORG> in liquidation and the sponsors of the arrangement and that objection cannot be brushed aside We have no hesitation in holding that in any event <ORG> of <ORG> ought to have directed a reconvening of the meeting of the members of the <ORG> in terms of Section of the Act to consider the modifications and ensured that the approval thereof by the requisite majority existed vii Mr <NAME> has submitted that the <ORG> Judge in the present case referred to <NAME> supra case and finally held that since Sections to are interconnected it would be able to grant relief asked for in a <ORG> Application filed under Section For this purpose the <ORG> has the jurisdiction and power to direct modification of the <ORG> which was required to be executed pursuant to clause of the <ORG> In the light of the stand taken by both parties this <ORG> analyzed the relief sought for in the <ORG> Application and the relevant materials placed before the <ORG> Judge However it is made clear that the power of the <ORG> does not extend to re writing the <ORG> in any manner xii Furthermore in the Companies Act there is no provision except Section to Section which deal with the procedure and power of <ORG> to sanction the <ORG> which fall within the ambit of the requirements as contemplated under these sections Therefore the application filed by <ORG> under Section is maintainable iii Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the <ORG> strongly relied on the following decisions of this <ORG> with reference to the importance of family arrangement <ORG> and its effect and value Thus it would appear from a review of the decisions analysed above that the courts have taken a very liberal and broad view of the validity of the family settlement and have always tried to uphold it and maintain it The central idea in the approach made by the courts is that if by consent of parties a matter has been settled it should not be allowed to be reopened by the parties to the agreement on frivolous or untenable grounds As observed by this <ORG> in <NAME> Family Charities case that if a person having full knowledge of his right as a possible reversioner enters into a transaction which settles his claim as well as the claim of the opponents at the relevant time he cannot be permitted to go back on that agreement when reversion actually falls open It essentially records a settlement arrived at regarding disputes and differences between the two groups which belong to the same family <ORG> contends that there is no merit in the challenge to the decision of the Chairman of <ORG> which has been made binding under the Memorandum of Understanding the private agreement which is lied upon by the plaitniffs whereunder there is a restriction on a living member to transfer his shareholding only to the branch of family to which he belongs in terms imposes two restrictions which are not stipulated in the Article Firstly it imposes a restriction on a living member to transfer the shares only to the existing members and secondly the transfer has to be only to a member belonging to the same branch of family They are therefore not binding either on the shareholders or on the company It is seen from the above decision that the agreement between the two groups of shareholders which impose certain restrictions on the transferability of the shares held by them was not binding either on the company or its shareholders because the restrictions so imposed by the agreement were contrary to the provisions of the Articles sale of shares held by one of the two groups in breach of the agreement could not therefore be held to be valid He also pointed out that the agreement between the shareholders is not binding on the company unless the company adopts it and it is incorporated in the Articles of Association It is clear that both parties acted upon the said family arrangement<ORG><ORG> dated The above referred letters and mails further confirmed that there is an arrangement made and agreed between the <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> it is also clear and show that the discussion between the group of officials was intended to expedite the implementation of the <ORG> by producing a suitable arrangement In fact the <ORG> Judge has pointed out that a specific reference was made in the <ORG> Application No of and there is no specific denial by the <ORG> Further it was demonstrated that after execution of MOU both the parties have been entering into contracts and agreements as an independent entity Apart from this it was pointed out that the <ORG> of <ORG> made a public announcement on i soon after the execution of <ORG> on the same day publicly acknowledging with gratitude to their mother Smt Nevertheless there is no specific requirement that the <ORG> must confirm completely with the <ORG> In this background it was contended by learned senior counsel appearing for <ORG> that it was necessary that <ORG> should have given full and proper opportunity to the <ORG> before passing such resolution hurriedly on and before executing such <ORG> and <ORG> in question On final copy of <ORG> was made available by nominee of <ORG> to nominee of <NAME> Group It was pointed out by the learned senior counsel for the <ORG> that pending the decisions and discussion on various aspects of gas supply agreement hurriedly in spite of objection by them the <ORG> on took a decision by majority and approved the <ORG> and <ORG> This shall not make a difference to the price for the gas supplied by <ORG> to <ORG> However <ORG> would still have to pay the transportation cost for supply to the West Coast even if the facility is not used but will have the right to deal with the capacity as it deems fit and to sell or assign the same to another party on the West Coast or otherwise viii <NAME> recognizes that a long terms stable source of gas from <ORG> which has the largest find of gas was absolutely essential for the growth plans of the <NAME> Group and in order to enable <NAME> to carry <ORG> to even greater heights If there is any action taken in bad faith for not obtaining<ORG>scuttling the obtaining of such approvals <NAME> reserves her ability to intervene again and the <NAME> Group would also have a claim for damages <ORG> also held that there is no absolute freedom to market the gas as argued by <ORG> But at the same time <ORG> held that there is nothing in the <ORG> to restrict the sale of gas by the contractor at a price lesser than that approved by the <ORG> On the other hand it is the claim of <ORG> that since the <ORG> is not a binding document there is no requirement that the <ORG> must replicate the <ORG> In other words it has a broader meaning There is a need to construct a suitable arrangement under Clause Supply of gas is a matter of national interest and in the present case due to the very nature of the companies involved there are huge number of shareholders and people who will be indirectly affected by the policies of the companies There is no duly constituted proceeding where any challenge has been laid to <ORG> Policy price fixation grant or refusal of approval <ORG> and <ORG> out of blocks which were given to these companies by the <ORG> on nomination basis There was however the problem of augmenting the production The relevant <ORG> provisions in <ORG> I which guide the pricing of KG gas are as follows Article The Contractor shall endeavour to sell all Natural Gas produced and saved from the Contract Area at arms length prices to the benefits of Parties to the Contract Article Notwithstanding the provision of Article Natural Gas produced from the Contract Area shall be valued for the purposes of this Contract as follows a Gas which is used as per Article or flared with the approval of the <ORG> or re injected or sold to the <ORG> pursuant to Article shall be ascribed a zero value Gas which is sold to the <ORG> or any other <ORG> nominee shall be valued at the prices actually obtained and Gas which is sold or disposed of otherwise than in accordance with paragraph a or shall be valued on the basis of competitive arms length sales in the region for similar sales under similar conditions For granting this approval <ORG> shall take into account the prevailing policy if any on pricing of Natural Gas including any linkages with traded liquid fuels and it may delegate or assign this function to a regulatory authority as and when such an authority is in existence The price formula approved by the <ORG> which is to be applicable uniformly to all sectors is as follows Price in US per mmbtu Crude Price It is further pointed out that the said exercise was undertaken by the government on an independent application of mind and government differed from the Contractor and the contractor relented leading to a lower price being fixed at instead of claimed by the contractor It is also brought to the notice of this <ORG> that <ORG> consisted of the Chairman External Affairs Minister who was a very senior Minister in <ORG> Ministers of the consuming sectors such as Fertilizer and Power the Minister from producing Sector i Petroleum Natural Gas and the Ministers in charge of <ORG> Law and Corporate Affairs besides <ORG> Due to this the price was determined to be on the basis of the formula price equivalent to Crude Price Another important consideration to be kept in mind is that the <ORG> overrides any other contract which may be entered into for the supply for gas Though there is freedom of trade within the <ORG> but this freedom is exercised by the contractor through a transparent bidding process and non interference of the <ORG> in the administration of gas supply <ORG> of <ORG> has held that even if the price is to be determined by the <ORG> there is no reason why <ORG> cannot sell the gas to <ORG> at a lower price than that It is also the grievance of <ORG> that the <ORG> must take into account the fact that the <ORG> provides for the legitimate rights of the Contractor to earn certain profits If these profits are reduced to such a degree it would affect the interest of the shareholders of <ORG> The question remains whether the <ORG> is unsuitable due to it not being a bankable contract or it reducing <ORG> to a shell company There is no evidence whatsoever to show that financing of any power project was declined because gas supply arrangement was considered to be non bankable There is no such understanding either in the <ORG> or in the <ORG> There are two ways to determine this namely a by way of fact evidence showing that banks<ORG>financial institutions<ORG>Funding agencies had rejected the project on account of unsuitability of certain clause of <ORG> or expert evidence suggesting that on the basis of such <ORG> it could not be possible for <ORG> to raise funds for the gas based power project This freedom is not absolute and certain restrictions have been imposed upon viz the prices at which the sale takes place have to be arms length prices and are subject to approval by the government <ORG> has made it clear that there is no specific provision under the production sharing contract to prevent the contractor to sell the gas at lesser price than what is fixed by the government for valuation of gas to the extent of its share and further observed that that the contractor has freedom to sell gas at arm length prices to the benefit of the parties to the production sharing contract out of their share of Profit gas to which art Even though this doctrine has been applied in cases dealing with environmental jurisprudence it has its broader application As pointed out earlier the proper interpretation of <ORG> gives the power to the <ORG> not only to determine the basis of valuation of gas but also its price But once it is determined that the <ORG> does have the power to determine the price of gas <ORG> decision regarding the price would be applicable Therefore <ORG> enjoys jurisdiction to entertain the application under Sections and of the Companies Act It has a broader meaning We grant special leave and proceed to dispose of all the appeals To this effect the <ORG> has been given the powers to place reasonable restrictions even on the Fundamental Rights of the individuals for the achievement of broader good for all the powers to enact socio economic legislation to effectuate re distribution of wealth and ensure equitable access to material resources and to frame policies that ameliorate the harsh consequences of the civil and the market spheres of social action that people participate in We draw attention to this problem because even though it is often associated with those countries that depend mostly on earnings from export of natural resources similar effects can also arise from activities within the domestic economy We hasten to add that we are The word political is being used in a technical sense to denote the state and all of its institutions rather than merely political parties or to denounce the normative desirability of democratic political processes Ultimately the residual owners of a company are its shareholders and they have a right to know what is happening to the company and its assets including assets by way of contractual rights so that they can take an informed decision about a proposal that is put up for their consideration For the past three hundred years of evolution of corporate law the principal theme has been the protection of those who give their wealth and resources in trust to a company It is with the above observations we shall now proceed to consider the facts and the issues that arise for our consideration On July in a <ORG> Meeting of RIL it was decided that in light of the fast emerging opportunities and exigencies and to facilitate quick response all the powers of the <ORG> be vested in <ORG> except those powers that the <ORG> was required by the Companies Act and the Articles of Association to retain It was also provided that <ORG> would be given an irrevocable power of attorney to be able to independently pursue the same though that was not to mitigate the burden to be borne by <ORG> <ORG> reserved the right to intervene and it was stated that <ORG> would have a right to damages in the event that <ORG> did not act in good faith It is clear from the correspondence that even until end of February there was no controversy that was raised regarding the requirement of governmental approvals In its statements made with respect to issuance of Global Depository Receipts in Luxembourg <ORG> specifically stated that gas supply agreements including price formula basis would be subject to governmental approvals and if approved it would then be able to sell it to end customers at market prices <ORG> disposed off the appeals of <ORG> and <ORG> by its order and judgment dated The decision at the level of <ORG> turned it seems on the fact that a portion of the MoU was jointly tendered by <ORG> and <ORG> and apperception of <ORG> that under the <ORG> <ORG> is entitled to a physical share of natural gas as a part of cost gas and profit gas The price of supply was to be in accordance with the <ORG> but as there was no clause in the <ORG> prohibiting <ORG> from selling it at a price lower than that arising from the price formula approved by the <ORG> natural gas up to the first MMSCMD at a well head price of USD mmBtu of natural gas stands allocated to <ORG> as <ORG> would still make profits at that price point There is considerable confusion as to what <ORG> ordered with respect to Utilisation Policy and its applicability with respect to the Option Volumes of natural gas provided for in the MoU Further in as much as on the face of the record it would appear that the <ORG> to which the <ORG> is a party has been interpreted without the <ORG> having had an opportunity to be properly impleaded and present its case and the potentially serious public interest implications that arise therefrom leave has been granted to the <ORG> Now we shall proceed to summarise the contentions of the parties made during the oral hearings spanning days and in the many thousands of pages of written documents The line of argument that <ORG> has taken in the course of these proceedings can be gleaned from the Six Protested Points they have raised about the underlying gas supply agreements We note each one of them below as substantively argued by <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> It is argued that by restricting its nominees to only those companies in which <ORG> owns at least the freedom of <ORG> to set up gas based energy producing companies is automatically restricted and in as much such a restriction was not placed on <ORG> it should be accordingly changed Limitation of Liability The promise made to <ORG> was that gas would be supplied to it from any of the gas fields given to <ORG> by <ORG> and consequently it should be possible to draft a liability clause that becomes operative in the event that there is no gas available at any of the gas fields or for reasons beyond the control of <ORG> of the GSMA and Clauses and of Schedule of the GSPA which substantively deal with the issue of approval of the price formula basis and also of applicability of governmental utilization policy or any other powers of the <ORG> to curtail production or otherwise prevent <ORG> from supplying natural gas <NAME> that even if one were to assume that the title does not pass through to the Contractor and that the <ORG> did have such rights when the binding commitments were made by <ORG> to <ORG> there was no utilization policy in place consequently <ORG> was free to find its own buyers under the marketing freedom promised by <ORG> the only policy in place Even if one were to consider <ORG> decisions as policy it cannot have retrospective effect and to this effect they placed reliance on <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> Moreover in as much as in the <ORG> minutes it is clearly recorded that their decisions are without prejudice to the rights of <ORG> in the court cases <ORG> rights were beyond the pale of <ORG> decision It was argued that the terms of gas supply which are in the nature of day to day agreements entered into by the Management and hence need not have been placed before the shareholders for approval and that the powers of a Director to enter into contracts are very wide and reliance is placed on <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> Maintainability It was also argued by the Learned Senior Counsel for <ORG> that the power of <ORG> is of the widest amplitude and that in fact it is the duty of the court to ensure that the Scheme is fully implemented and the only limitation on the powers of the court is that it cannot change the character purpose or basic structure of the Scheme Under the <ORG> <ORG> would have the right to nominate affiliates to whom gas is required to be supplied under different <ORG>s The minutes of the <ORG> meetings and the discussions recorded clearly show that the <ORG> sought the opinion of <ORG> and outside professionals in deciding whether to go with the reorganization or not and also the nature of the Scheme that was to be put together <NAME> Sections and of the Companies Act raise the presumption that the record of the proceedings of the meetings of the <ORG> are accurate The minutes of the <ORG> were never challenged and were never put in issue in any proceeding With respect to the Doctrine of Identification <NAME> argues that it has no relevance in the context of the facts of these cases Hence the Doctrine of Identification which arises in cases involving torts and criminal liability has no application here According to <ORG> there is nothing unconscionable in the six clauses that have been protested and hence also the application by <ORG> was not maintainable <NAME> also argued that what is contemplated in Sections of the Companies Act is an arrangement between the company and a class of shareholders <NAME> there are two kinds of Production Sharing Contracts one in which physical produce is shared and the other in which revenue is shared To this effect he also drew our attention to the fact that the <ORG> considered by this Court in <ORG> <ORG> supra is different from the <ORG> in hand and hence that case is not applicable Shorn of all the details and lengthy submissions and contentions we shall now proceed to consider the relevant and substantive issues that are required to be dealt with However because it is also an exhaustible and non renewable resource there is an imperative need to conserve it We have referred to a number of journals articles and books in this regard too numerous to all be cited and one Ibid <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Regulating Public Utilities A Constitutional Approach <ORG> Competition in Energy Markets thing stands out there are no completely unregulated free markets for natural gas anywhere in the world There are of course many more articles in the public domain regarding this There are of course industry experts who do not agree <NAME> and <NAME> point out there are four basic arrangements between host countries and multinational oil companies the concession the production sharing agreement the participation agreement and the service contract Thus it is a resource that falls squarely within the purview of Article of the Constitution of India and is explicitly noted so in the <ORG> emphasis supplied Consequently we have to hold that it is the people of India the true owners who have vested the inclusive set of potential resources in a particular class of geographic zones in the <ORG> and that it is an act of trust and of faith with a specific set of instructions The core and pure purport of the word hold is to conserve to preserve and to keep in place and it only secondarily means use or disposal Within the context of international law there has emerged a body of thought under the broad rubric of Human Rights that the people as the true owners of natural wealth and resources ought to exercise a permanent sovereignty i the power to make laws over such resources to ensure national development and well being of the people Consequently Article of the Constitution should be construed in light of Article of the Constitution and be understood as placing an affirmative obligation upon the <ORG> to ensure that distribution of material resources of the community does not result in heightening of inequalities amongst people and amongst regions As we have noted above Article of the Constitution is a special provision which leads us to conclude that the powers granted to the <ORG> to hold the resources for purposes of the <ORG> casts special obligations over and above what are normally affixed with respect of all other resources that the <ORG> may be permitted to act upon pursuant to Article sectors could potentially be deprived of access to such resources allow the extraction of such resources without a clear policy statement of conservation which takes into account total domestic availability the requisite balancing of current needs with those of future generations and also India security requirements allow the extraction and distribution without periodic evaluation of the current distribution and making an assessment of how greater equity can be achieved as between sectors and also between regions allow a contractor or any other agency to extract and distribute the resources without the explicit permission of <ORG> which permission can be granted only pursuant to a rationally framed utilization policy and no end user may be given any guarantee for continued access and of use beyond a period to be specified by the <ORG> The word <ORG> referring to crude oil or natural gas as the case may be is used in two senses in different parts of the <ORG> as a physical product and also in terms of the monetized value International Accounting Whereas Value is said to be The expression VALUE in relation to any goods shall be deemed to be the wholesale cash price for which such goods of the like kind and quality are sold or are capable of being sold for delivery at the place of manufacture and at the time of their removal therefrom Also according to Black Law Dictionary Value is said to be In as much as the words volume and value have different connotations and meanings though occasionally they may have some overlap the fact that one was replaced by the other implies that the meaning ascribable in the context of this <ORG> should eliminate the overlap Further Article specifically states that the Contractor shall endeavour to sell all Natural Gas produced and saved This indicates that the entire set of all Petroleum Operations are to end in a sale at the Delivery Point so it has to be concluded that the phrase produced and saved in the <ORG> encompasses the activity of sale of natural gas Consequently under this <ORG> <ORG> has no rights whatsoever to take physical quantities volume of natural gas as a part of <ORG> or <ORG> in as much as the contractor right to take anything under the <ORG> can only be from the total value i total revenue received from sale of natural gas We have verified that contract also which was placed before us and we do find the difference as submitted by <NAME> It should be noted that in as much as title passes only upon sale at the Delivery Point the true owner the people of India acting through <ORG> have a sovereign right that is tempered by public law in determining the manner in which that sale is effectuated The sale at the Delivery Point takes place when the people of India are still the owners of the natural gas and consequently they have the responsibility of ensuring that they exercise their permanent sovereignty through their elected government in order to achieve a broad set of goals that constitute national development Article clearly contemplates that the pool of eligible buyers of natural gas extends to the whole of Indian Article gives the right to the Contractor to use a small part of the Natural Gas produced from the Contract Area for purposes of Petroleum Operations such as reinjection for pressure maintenance in Oil Fields gas lifting and captive power generation required for Petroleum Operations i for technical purposes of extraction and saving of natural gas It does not speak of <ORG> having a right to unilaterally decide who to sell to We note that it does not say that the Contractor take into account a government utilization policy only if there is one In such circumstances one cannot imagine how the <ORG> could have framed a Utilisation Policy with respect to inter sectoral needs the requirements arising from strategic considerations or some other necessary factor that would be needed to be taken into consideration so many years ahead of actual production It was also argued by the learned senior counsel for <ORG> that various utterances by senior officials and replies by some Ministers in the <ORG> indicate that the Government knew that the <ORG> provided the kinds of rights to <ORG> that <ORG> claims in order to sustain its demands The answers at the most may reflect the opinion of an individual minister and they would have no bearing on the interpretations to be placed by the courts Is the Price Formula Basis For Valuation to determine government Share or For Sale of All Natural Gas It was argued on behalf of <ORG> that the provisions of Article titled Valuation can be read to mean that the right of the <ORG> to approve a price formula basis is only to enable it to place a value on natural gas to be able to determine its own physical share of the natural gas and that consequently <ORG> was free to sell it at whatever price it may to sell it at so long as the price is an arms length price In a seller market i where natural gas is in acute shortage the options given to a buyer can have a huge bearing on the price There is a reason for such a requirement <ORG> is taking a clause that is provided to protect the <ORG> in the event that <ORG> is unable to determine whether it can assure to itself that the Contractor has sold or is selling at the stated price and conflating it to a right of <ORG> At any rate as there is no provision for sharing physical quantities the question of <ORG> fixing the price for its share of gas does not arise It is needless to state that under Article of the Constitution the powers of the <ORG> executive do extend to matters upon which the <ORG> is competent to legislate and are not confined to matters over which the legislation has been passed already There is no need to dilate further on this issue since there is no independent challenge questioning the validity of <ORG> decisions Be that as it may we now turn to some of the issues that come up for our consideration with respect to matters internal to <ORG> We have already expressed our view about that set of questions Does that mean then that the Scheme with respect to the Gas Based Energy Business which is now <ORG> has become unworkable We hold that it has not become unworkable but only that one part of the Scheme which was in any case in the nature of a contingent and a highly uncertain event has not come to pass for now on account of events and powers beyond the capacity of those who proposed the Scheme First and foremost it would seem extremely unlikely that bankers do not understand that there are always supply risks associated with natural gas in a country like India whether that be on account of <ORG> policies or otherwise We see no reason to conflate that general condition which affects everyone in the Indian economy to an issue of workability of the Scheme itself There is not even a whisper of protection of a broader class of shareholders in the <ORG> If there is any action taken in bad faith for not obtaining scuttling the obtaining of such approvals <ORG> reserves her ability to intervene again and <ORG> would also have a claim for damages At first we heard an argument by <ORG> that the said paragraphs do not relate to gas supply as such but general governmental and statutory approvals with respect to reorganization When pointed out that general approvals were provided for separately in the section of the <ORG> dealing with Manner of Business Segregation we next heard the arguments from <ORG> counsel that these relate to laying of pipes and make other arrangements for transport of natural gas from Kakinada The first one relates to <ORG> total failure to rebut the inferences drawn by <NAME> from the fact that <ORG> and <ORG> executives had accepted that <ORG> draft agreements from May were to be the basis for gas supply agreements and those draft <ORG> agreements specifically provided for governmental approvals To this effect he pointed out to the differences between Section which he stated was a complete code because it included powers of supervision in the post sanction scenario and Section which does not have similar provisions In this regard he also argued that the ratio of <ORG> supra should be construed to be that courts have the power to modify terms of the scheme to remove impediments and the like to make the scheme function properly so long as the basic fabric of the scheme is not affected According to Shri <NAME> the judgment of this Court in <ORG> supra sets out the correct position in which it was stated in para that Section of the Act only gives power to the <ORG> to make such modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or arrangement it cannot be understood as a power to make substantial modifications in the scheme approved by the members in a meeting called in terms of Section of the Act Further while the <ORG> does state that the powers of the court are of the widest amplitude including the power to modify a provision of the scheme it also does hold that the same can only be exercised so as to ensue the proper working of the Scheme and further that such powers may not be exercised in a manner that would alter the basic fabric of the scheme That understanding would certainly not have comprehended the claims that <ORG> is putting forward in these proceedings i that the intent was to actually share the benefits of the production and exploration activities including the benefit of internal use of natural gas ii that because the same was not possible on account of statutory and contractual problems the gas supply agreement was a way out iii that the gas be supplied in accordance with the commercial terms regarding quantity price and tenure in the MoU which were never revealed to them iv that the burden of gas supply would involve the transgression of the boundaries of the <ORG> from which the value flows to RIL and that the burden would extend to <ORG> subsidizing <ORG> if it were required to pay a much higher value to <ORG> than what it receives from <ORG> In contrast to the foregoing all that the class of members who approved the scheme and the court which sanctioned it would have understood was that normal commercial agreements of supply that would protect the interests of both parties and also including the clauses of governmental agreements would be put in place The parties are bound by the governmental policy and approvals regarding price quantity and tenure for supply of gas iv under the <ORG> in issue the Contractor RIL does not become the owner of natural gas and there is nothing like specified physical quantities of natural gas to be shared by the <ORG> and the Contractor we accordingly direct the parties to renegotiate as to the suitable arrangements for supply of gas de hors the MoU What remains for us is to place our appreciation on record of the invaluable assistance rendered by <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> all learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the parties
