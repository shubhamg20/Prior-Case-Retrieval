On the other side of the road there was another tea shop owned by one <NAME> Investigation was taken up by Sub Inspector <NAME> and he set out at A He first went to the hospital and having learned that Nepal condition was so serious that he could not be interrogated he came to the place where the occurrence of stabbing had taken place and made seizures of a yellow chaddar and a kantha which he had found spread on two benches in a tin shed having no wall Dr A Chakraborty who had examined and treated Nepal in the hospital found the following injuries on the person of Nepal Injuries One incised wound cutting the muscles rios and intercostal spaces on left side of the chest away from the mid sternal line on rd and th ribs mid clavicular line with beveling inwards towards sternum direction long axis of the chest Before us Mr <NAME> learned Advocate who has appeared on behalf of the condemned prisoner <NAME> has drawn our attention to the representations before <ORG> for raising two points From these features appearing in the order sheet of the trial and the records Mr <NAME> has contended that there was practically no defence of the accused at the trial because the learned defence lawyer <NAME> had not been put in possession of any brief when he was asked to cross examine the two important witnesses the doctors he got the possession of the brief he had no opportunity at all to study the brief for conducting effective cross examination of those important witnesses By raising these contentions Mr <NAME> has emphasised that though he is raising the point regarding representation of parties at the trial in <ORG> as a point of law sufficiently strong in itself to vitiate the trial as a matter of law he is not urging it as a mere technicality only but also as a point of substance on the merits of the case because the materials brought in evidence show according to him that prosecution was not only not producing all the witnesses and materials before the <ORG> but also prosecution was not eliciting materials and essential information from important witnesses who had been examined so much so that this was a case where for any effective defence the lawyer representing the accused needed sufficient opportunity and time to study the brief for not only exposing the contradictions and incongruities appearing in the prosecution evidence but also for eliciting essential information by effective cross examination of the several important witnesses examined in the case He has referred to the definition of public prosecutor given in Section Sub section Clause or the Code and also to Section of that Code for showing howsoever appointed or engaged the designation in either of these two provisions in the Code is public prosecutor In neither of those provisions can be found any authority given either to the State Government or the District Magistrate or for the matter of that the Additional District Magistrate acting under Sub section of Section Cr Such rate shall not exceed tho rate payable to the Public Prosecutor In that amended form para of Chapter II of Part VI of the Manual makes it possible to adhere to Rule in Chap XI of the Manual that provides that <ORG> should provide advocates or pleaders for defence when necessary It has no validity or force in <ORG> and must be rejected as an authority for any lawyer to act as a Public Prosecutor in <NAME> trial We notice with great concern that although law on this subject was clearly <ORG>d in the decisions of this Court which we have mentioned above the illegal practice has continued to be indulged in not only in the present case but also in many cases that have come to our notice in recent past In the present trial it was much more important that the person on trial facing a capital charge should have the assistance of a lawyer who had opportunity to prepare the brief for proper defence by effective cross examination than the trouble and cost to which <ORG> would have been subjected by an adjournment of the trial In that case the Supreme <ORG> while laying down that it cannot be laid down as a rule of law that in every capital case where the accused is unrepresented the trial should be held to be vitiated also laid down that a <ORG> of Appeal or Revision is not powerless to interfere if it is found that the accused was so handicapped for want of legal aid that the proceedings against him may be said to amount to negation of a fair trial and who testified to the nature of the injuries found on the victim and the investigating Police officer It has been contended in some cases that in such situation it is much safer and better for the accused to go undefended at the trial because it may be expected that he then may draw the active watchful and energetic attention of the presiding Judge to test prosecution witnesses by questions and check prosecution counsel against any unfairness or over zealousness to introduce inadmissible or prejudicial evidence There is much force and cogency in that argument because a show of defence is not a substitute for effective defence and it is much worse than none as it may turn out to be a false show and in effect tend to neutralise a stronger force that an alert Judge is expected to be This Court had occasion to pronounce a judgment upon consideration of such situation in the case of We respectfully agree with the view of law expressed in that passage occurring in the judgment delivered by <NAME> in that case in these words Before we part with the case we have to strike a note of warning against the practice of some of the Sessions Judges appointing raw and inexperienced juniors to defend the accused in capital cases If however such inexperienced advocates alone are available to defend such unfortunate accused the <ORG> has a primary duty to come to the aid of the accused by putting timely and useful questions and warning the advocates from treading on dangerous grounds Those will be revealed presently when we will discuss evidence as it appears in the records in this case The fact that there was a lawyer engaged by the <ORG> to defend the accused at the trial does not relieve the Appellate <ORG> of the duty to examine if there was real prejudice to the accused To that we may add that the loud feature in the manner of continuing the trial in the absence of the defence lawyer who had the brief by setting up another defence lawyer who had not the brief and the characteristic appearing in the record of the depositions of witnesses examined for prosecution heightened by omission of the trial Judge to expose by timely and proper questions the mysteries of carefully chosen technical language in totality appears to be a negation of a fair trial For ascertaining whether there is sufficient material to justify a retrial and what should be the proper order examination of evidence given in the case is necessary We notice with regret that these features appearing in the evidence given by prosecution and revealed by little cross examination that could be made by the defence lawyer who had no opportunity to study the brief did not attract die notice of the learned Additional Sessions Judge for asking any timely question during examination of the witnesses in box and the paucity of material information on crucial points thereby appearing have been turned by the learned Judge against the accused in his judgment by which he has assigned the unfortunate man to the hangman rope The Jury should be told that it is their duty to consider carefully and to say whether they are convinced by the prosecution evidence and that if they arc not convinced there is no law which obliges them to convict But he said that it has been so because there was not effective cross examination on very material points and the learned trial Judge had not before him any definite defence case or criticism of prosecution evidence But no information has been vouchsafed to enable the <ORG> to ascertain if there was any element of cadaveric rigidity or spasm present in what was being described as rigor mortis Indeed we have no material in evidence if Dr <NAME> was qualified in medical science to distinguish cadaveric spasm which is not rigor mortis Those astonishing details of parentage and native address of the cobbler <NAME> do not at all fit with the prosecution version that this I was lodged and recorded at a on the information of <NAME> because it is not at all probable that he could havo had ready all those informations about the accused <NAME> at that hour immediately after the occurrence This state of evidence has led us to the conclusion that upon the evidence produced by prosecution at the trial despite the handicap to which defence had been subjected at the trial not only the prosecution has failed to prove the offence against <NAME> by any reliable evidence but also there are materials in the evidence which very strongly point to his innocence In such circumstances there is no reason for sending the case back for retrial because that would only open the door for the possibility of prosecution endeavouring to brush up the defects so loudly appearing in the evidence given in this trial We therefore allow the appeal set aside the order of conviction and sentence and acquit <NAME> I entirely agree with the judgment rendered by my Lord in the case under appeal and with the order passed in the Death Sentence reference case rejecting the reference acquitting the accused <NAME> of the charge under Section of the Indian Penal Code upon setting aside his conviction under that section I would however add a few words of my own to follow up the points upon which my Lord has given judgment In the present case we take judicial notice of the fact that in and even to this day there has been for the district of Parganas a Public Prosecutor appointed generally by <ORG> under Section of the Code The A <NAME> without being appointed a Public Prosecutor by the Additional District Magistrate under Section of the Code could have functioned as Public Prosecutor as defined under Section of the Code in the case if only he was directed by the Public Prosecutor appointed generally for Parganas by <ORG> under Section of the Code to act in the case in question as prosecutor for the <ORG> put as <NAME> was engaged as public prosecutor in the case by the Additional District Magistrate under Section of the Code the Public Prosecutor for Parganas appointed generally by <ORG> must have had been either away from the local area or had been so circumstanced that even being physically present in the local area had neither the physical ability nor the mental capacity and alertness to direct any person to act as prosecutor for the <ORG> in the case necessitating thereby for the appointment of <NAME> as a Public Prosecutor in the case by the Additional District Magistrate under Section of the Code So if <NAME> was at the time of his engagement in the category of any person within Section of the Code naving had been enlisted administratively in the panel of eligible lawyers he could be engaged for acting in the case as Public Prosecutor within the provisions of Section of the Code it and when he was so directed by the Public Prosecutor to act as such for the <ORG> in the case before the learned Additional Sessions Judge Parganas In the revisional proceedings before this Court the Division Bench had to set aside the order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate observing that the Sub Divisional Magistrate had no jurisdiction to ignore the order of appointment of public prosecutor in the case made by the Additional District Magistrate under Section of the Code It does not also appear from the judgment that there was either no public prosecutor appointed under Section of the Code or if appointed was absent in the sense I have already explained in this judgment within the scope and content of the expression in The Division Bench in <NAME> case had not to consider such situation as has arisen in the present case within the scope and contents of the provisions of Section of the Code My Lord as Judge in Charge of the English Department of the High <ORG> would be pleased to draw the attention of the inferior criminal <ORG>s in the <ORG> as to the desirability of placing facts in the record of a case indicating the legal authority of any person other than the public prosecutor appointed under Section of the Code appearing as public prosecutor in the ease representing the <ORG> so that in this <ORG> in a situation as has arisen in this case and had arisen in several other cases in one of which I had the pleasure of associating myself with the judgment rendered by my Lord much of the arguments of lawyers could be spared economising time and labour and the matter could be adequately deall with from the materials appearing in the record of the cases A person accused of an offence under Article of the Constitution of India has a right to be defended by a lawyer of his choice There was in fact denial of proper and effective representation the accused at the murder trial before the learned Additional Sessions Judge The learned Judge expressed himself in the words which I cannot help quoting here Every procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice clear and true between the <ORG> and the accused denies the latter duo process of law In such a context as that appearing in this case their Lordships in <NAME> case Supra laid down that it would be proper for the appellate <ORG> not to rely upon the oral evidence of eye witnesses implicating the particular accused unless there is some circumstantial evidence to support it We respectfully accept such principle which should have been followed by the learned trial Judge in this case So there is a reasonable doubt as to spot wherefrom the chisel was recovered How he was material In the first information it was stated by <NAME> though he did not speak it out in evidence that <NAME> name was first called out and he was recognised by <NAME> who shouted Look here <NAME> was teasing the puppies thereby revealing in that statement that one <NAME> was the first man who identified the man who is now the condemned prisoner <NAME> before us
