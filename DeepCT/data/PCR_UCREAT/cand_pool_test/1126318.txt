It is incorrect to say that income cannot signify Capital gains and it is equally an incorrect approach to hold that there is a legislative practice which recognises a clear line of demarcation between income and capital What is relied on here as a legislative practice is nothing but the judicial interpretation given to the word income as used in the income tax and fiscal statutes The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS DAS This appeal is directed against the judgment pronounced on the th September by <ORG> at Bombay on a reference made at the instance of the appellant under section of the Indian Income tax Act The assessee had a half share in certain immovable properties situate in Bombay which were sold by the assessee and his coowners during the relevant accounting year which was the calendar year ending on the st December to a private limited company known as <ORG> The profits on the sale of the said properties amounted to Rs In April the appellant appealed from the said order to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner contending that section of the Act authorising the levy of tax on capital gains was ultra vires <ORG> A further appeal to <ORG> was dismissed by its order dated the th June <ORG> agreeing that certain questions of law did arise out of its order drew up a statement of the case which was agreed to by the parties and referred to <ORG> the following questions Whether the imposition of a tax under the head capital gains by <ORG> was ultra vires Whether the imposition was in any way invalid on the ground that it was done by amending the Indian Income tax Act After hearing the reference <ORG> following its judgment in Income tax Reference No In that reference the two learned Judges gave the same answer to the first question but on different grounds as elaborated in their respective judgments Under section of the Government of India Act <ORG> was empowered to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to that Act <NAME> held that the enactment of Act XXII of which inserted section was well within the scope of the legislative powers of <ORG> as it fell within entry and was valid either as a whole or in any case to the extent that it applied to individuals and companies <NAME> on the other hand held that Act XXII of was wholly intra vires <ORG> as it fell within entry and in this view of the matter he did not consider it necessary to discuss whether the legislation was covered by entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule He submitted that the learned Chief Justice was entirely right in the view that there was a clear line of demarcation that had always been observed by English lawyers and English jurists between income and capital that the English legislative practice had always recognised this difference and that as the word had come to acquire a certain meaning and a certain connotation by reason of such legislative practice in England the British <ORG> which enacted the Government of India Act must be regarded as having understood and used that word income in entry in that sense There is no warrant for saying that these observations out down the natural meaning of the ordinary English word income in any way The truth of the matter is that while Income tax legislation adopts an inclusive definition of the word income the scheme of such legislation is to bring to charge only such income as falls under certain specified heads the Schedules of the English Act of and our section read with the following sections and as arises or accrues or is received or is deemed to arise or accrue or to be received as mentioned in the statute There is no reason to suppose that the interpretation placed by the <ORG>s on the word in question was intended to be exhaustive of the connotation of the word income outside the particular statute The problem there was whether the foreign income of an English company which was a partner in a firm carrying on business in Bombay and whose Indian income was greater than its foreign income could be treated as a resident within the meaning of section A It was in that context said in that case that in determining the scope and meaning of the legislative power regard was to be had to what was ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in the legislative practice of the United Kingdom The same remarks apply to the case of <NAME> Dunphy referred to by Lord <NAME> in delivering the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra VI sections and capital gains have been included as taxable income In should be remembered that the question before us relates to the correct interpretation of a word appearing in a Constitution Act which as has been said must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense Itis therefore clear anditisacknowledged by Chief Justice <NAME> that in construing an entry in a List conferring legislative powers the widest possible construction according to their ordinary meaning must be put upon the words used therein construing words in a constitutional enactment conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude Mr <NAME> concedes that the word income is understood in the United States and Australia in the wide sense contended for by the learned Attorney General but he maintains that the law in England is different and therefore entry which occurs in a Parliamentary statute should be construed according to the law of England The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
