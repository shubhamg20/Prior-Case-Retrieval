Ultimately on November the plaintiffs filed the present suit against both the defendants for recovery of the said claim of Rs It might be mentioned here that the claim in the suit is jointly against both the defendants and it is not against either of the defendants in the first instance and against the other in the alternative arbitration proceedings against defendants No and the suit which would have to proceed in any case against defendants No Section of the Arbitration Act provides that the <ORG> may make an order staying the proceedings Once the party moving for a stay has shown that the dispute is within a valid and subsisting arbitration clause the burden of showing why effect should not be given to the agreement to submit is upon the party opposing the application for stay They however submit to the orders of the <ORG> with regard to the stay of the suit against defendants No decided by <NAME> as he then was and <NAME> In that case the suit was filed by the plaintiff for recovery of Rs On the allegations that the defendants who were not parties to the arbitration agreement were benamidars and were not persons of substance the <ORG> thought that there was sufficient reason for refusing stay The suit was filed by the owner of a vessel on <ORG> between the plaintiffs and defendant No And as the same issue as regards the liability of the principal debtor will have to be gone into both in the suit and in the arbitration proceedings there is every likelihood of conflicting findings and hence the suit could not be stayed I am afraid I prefer to follow the Indian decisions Bench it is observed that where a certain party who is a stranger to the arbitration agreement is joined as co defendant and the <ORG> finds that the said party was made a co defendant in the suit only for the purpose of escaping from the arbitration agreement the <ORG> would hold that the suit as against the co defendant was frivolous and vexatious and that the <ORG> would not reject the application for stay It is further observed in the said judgment that in that case defendants No had been joined mala fide for the purpose of escaping from the arbitration agreement and further that there was no possibility of conflicting decisions in the arbitration proceedings and in the <ORG> The plaintiffs have a bona fide claim against defendants No either jointly with defendants No or in the alternative If the suit is stayed as against defendants No and decided by arbitration and proceeded with against defendants No in <ORG> in my opinion there is every likelihood of conflicting findings in the award and the judgment of the <ORG>
