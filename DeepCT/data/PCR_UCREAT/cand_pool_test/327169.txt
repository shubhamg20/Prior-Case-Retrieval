These persons filed suits in <ORG> praying for perpetual injunction restraining the <ORG> from interfering with their business and or removing or demolishing any temporary structures put up by them for plying their trade He however held that by virtue of the <ORG> licence granted in their favour the plaintiffs had acquired the right to occupy and carry on business at the suit sites till their licence was not terminated by the <ORG> according to the procedure laid down in proviso a ii of Sub Section of Section of the Act Two of the squatters namely <NAME> and his brother filed writ petitions in this <ORG> seeking a writ of mandamus ordaining the Municipal <ORG> to allot each of them a suitable site on pavement in front of the main gate of the hospital The respondent who was one of the plaintiffs who had filed suits in the court of Subordinate Judge moved the <ORG> under Article of the Constitution for a writ and direction restraining the <ORG> from evicting her without the due process of law It expressed no opinion on the question whether there was any statutory obligation cast on the Municipal <ORG> to provide alternative site to a person making illegal encroachment on a public place like any public street etc That apart the <ORG> could not have made the impugned direction contrary to the provisions contained in ss and of the Act With all respect to the learned Judge who passed the order in <NAME> case and to the learned Judge who agreed with him we cannot concede that this <ORG> is bound to follow it It was delivered without argument without reference to the relevant provisions of the Act conferring express power on the Municipal <ORG> to direct removal of encroachments from any public place like pavements or public streets and without any citation of authority Accordingly we do not propose to uphold the decision of the <ORG> because it seems to us that it is wrong in principle and cannot be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a statute Mere casual expressions carry no weight at all The Judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by SEN The main question involved in this appeal from a judgment and order of <ORG> of <ORG> dated March is whether <ORG> was justified in the facts and circumstances of the case in issuing a direction to the appellant <ORG> to construct a stall or a kiosk on the pavement near the OPD gate of <ORG> Delhi within two months from the date of its order or in the alternative to furnish a plan with requisite sanction to the respondent <NAME> to enable her to construct a stall of her own On February eight of these pavement squatters instituted separate suits in <ORG> II Class Delhi against <ORG> seeking the relief of perpetual injunction restraining the appellant its officers and servants from interfering with their business of hawking on the pavements out side the main gate of the hospital and or from demolishing or removing any temporary structures put up by them for plying their trade The <ORG> accordingly under of the Delhi <ORG> Act had the right and authority to remove such encroachment without notice and ii that the plaintiffs had no legally enforceable right under the terms of the tehbazari licence they having committed violation of the terms and conditions there of besides being in arrears of licence fee The contention of the plaintiffs was that <ORG> having itself allotted the plaintiffs licence under of the Act on tehbazari basis to use the pavement in front of the main gate of <ORG> for carrying on their business on specific terms and conditions such grant of licence or permission gave to them a right under of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act which could not be terminated unilaterally without affording them an opportunity of a hearing under proviso a to sub of of the Act On February <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs in all the suits made a statement to the effect The plaintiffs shall occupy only ft In this light the plaintiffs have no right to claim an injunction against demolition or removal of any stall or other structure if posted or placed or affat the same time defendant <ORG> cannot remove the plaintiffs nor interfere with their business at the suit site in any other manner without terminating their licence to occupy the said sites in accordance with the procedure contained in sec It therefore follows that the learned Subordinate Judge accordingly disallowed the plaintiffs main claim seeking a declaration that <ORG> had no right or authority to remove the stalls built up by them on the pavement in front of the main gate of the Irwin Hospital He however held that by virtue of the tehbazari licence granted in their favour the plaintiffs had acquired the right to occupy and carry on business at the suit site each admeasuring ft It had no power to remove the plaintiffs nor interfere with their business at the suit sites There was a further development It was averred that <ORG> could not take recourse to its power of eviction under a of the Act without terminating the tehbazari licence in their favour and without following the procedure prescribed by proviso a to of the Act It expressed no opinion on the question whether there was any statutory obligation cast on <ORG> to provide alternative site to a person making illegal encroachment on a public place like any public street etc That apart <ORG> could not have made the impugned direction contrary to the provisions contained in ss and of the Act Having regard to this express provision <ORG> failed to see that the respondent <NAME> had no legally enforceable right to the grant of a writ or direction in the nature of mandamus Furthermore <ORG> could not also make the impugned direction in view of the provision contained in a of the Act which expressly confers power on the Commissioner to cause the removal of any structure which constitutes an encroachment on a public place like a street which is meant for the use of the pedestrains With all respect to the learned Judge who passed the order in <NAME> case and to the learned Judge who agreed with him we cannot concede that this <ORG> is bound to follow it It was delivered without argument without reference to the relevant provisions of the Act conferring express power on <ORG> to direct removal of encroachments from any public place like pavement or public streets and without any citation of authority Accordingly we do not propose to uphold the decision of <ORG> because it seems to us that it is wrong in principle and cannot be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a statute explains the concept of sub silentio at in these words A decision passes sub silentio in the technical sense that has come to be attached to that phrase when the particular point of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the court or present to its mind The <ORG> may consciously decide in favour of one party because of point A which it considers and pronounces upon It may be shown however that logically the court should not have decided in favour of the particular party unless it also decided point in his favour but point was not argued or considered by the court In such circumstances although point was logically involved in the facts and although the case had a specific outcome the decision is not an authority on point Point is said to pass sub silentio No consideration was given to the question whether a garnishee order could properly be made on an account standing in the name of the liquidator Mere casual expressions carry no weight at all of the Constitution or that the right to life includes a right to livelihood The learned Chief Justice however said that the section conferred a discretionary power which like all power must be exercised reasonably and in conformity with the provisions of our Constitution speaking for himself and one of us Sen held that the impugned provision was in the nature of a reasonable restriction in the interests of the general public on the exercise of the right of hawkers to carry on their trade or business The learned Chief Justice added No one has any right to do his or her trade or business so as to cause nuisance annoyance or inconvenience to the other members of the public The judgment and order passed by <ORG> are set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondent in <ORG> is dismissed
