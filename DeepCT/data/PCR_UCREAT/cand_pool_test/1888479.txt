It also decided to withdraw the case under Section Criminal to itself and added a direction under Section that the case be tried by warrant procedure but without a jury The facts giving rise to these appeals are these <ORG> was incorporated in Tanjore in with an authorized capital of Rs An application was made in <ORG> on to wind up the bank and a winding up order was made on and <ORG> were appointed official liquidators The charge sheet is a bald one in that it does not make mention of many of such facts and acts It is therefore necessary before proceeding further with the case that the prosecution should place before the Court in writing briefly a summary of its case as has been disclosed by the evidence against the accused individually or jointly and the section of law under which such acts constitute an offence We can find nothing whatsoever wrong or mala fide in the accusation of conspiracy to falsify accounts from December but everything wrong with the way in which books documents and papers of this bank under liquidation have been flung into this case without any attempt at selection or crystallising specific charges on which the prosecution sought to bring home the guilt to offenders We have no hesitation in quashing all the charges framed not on the legal ground of misjoinder but for the other reasons we have given We find no justification in <ORG> judgment for ordering a de novo trial in the situation that had arisen All these persons had stood a protracted trial for two and a half years which according to <ORG> resulted in charges which were impossible to be tried at a single trial We have further not been able to follow why it was necessary to transfer the case to <ORG> and to deny the accused persons the right of trial by jury under Section Criminal We think that <ORG> overstepped the limits of its jurisdiction inasmuch as it exercised it in an arbitrary manner without keeping in mind the prejudice it would cause to the accused The appeals are therefore allowed the order of <ORG> directing a de novo trial of the appellants before itself is set aside and the order quashing the charges is upheld
