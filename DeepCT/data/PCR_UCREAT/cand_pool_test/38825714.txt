At the foot of the said notices it was stated that failure on the part of the Official Liquidator to comply with the terms of those notices would not only result in ex parte assessment against the <ORG> but might also entail penalty under Section of the Income tax Act Certain negotiations followed between the Official Liquidator and the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income tax but they were infructuous On an application made by the Official Liquidator in <ORG> questioning the jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue the said notices or to proceed with the re assessment of the <ORG> without the leave of <ORG> winding up the <ORG> <ORG> on th September held that the income tax authorities were not entitled to commence the assessment or reassessment proceedings contemplated against <ORG> or to continue the same without obtaining leave of the <ORG> under Section of the Companies Act Act No of hereinafter called the Act The learned Judge on this view granted an injunction restraining <ORG> from assessing or re assessing the said <ORG> for the assessment years to Before the appellate bench two contentions were raised on behalf of <ORG> that notices for reassessment issued under Section were not legal proceedings within the meaning of that phrase as used in Section of the Act and that assuming the re assessment proceedings started under the said notices to be legal proceedings leave of <ORG> under Section of the Act was not necessary because the Income tax Officer had exclusive jurisdiction to make re assessment and to determine the tax liability The proceedings by way of assessment before the Income tax Officer according to the contention were outside the pale of jurisdiction of all civil courts including <ORG> The Official Liquidator after securing a certificate of fitness from <ORG> under Article of the Constitution has appealed to this Court and the only question which requires consideration here is if it is necessary for the Income tax Officer to obtain leave of the liquidation court when he wants to re assess the company for escaped income in respect of past years The Court which is winding up the company shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force have jurisdiction to entertain or dispose of a any suit or proceeding by or against the company any claim made by or against the company including claims by or against any of its branches in India any question of priorities or any other question whatsoever whether of law or fact which may relate to or arise in course of the winding up of the company whether such suit or proceeding has been instituted or is instituted or such claim or question has arisen or arises or such application has been made or is made before or after the order for the winding up of the company or before or after the commencement of the Companies Amendment Act Any suit or proceeding by or against the company which is pending in any Court other than that in which the winding up of the company is proceeding may notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be transferred to and disposed of by that Court Nothing in Sub section or Sub section shall apply to any proceeding pending in appeal before <ORG> or <ORG> Section provides for applications for winding up and Section tells us when the winding up of a company is to be deemed to commence Section which confers power on courts to stay or restrain proceedings against the company reads At any time after the presentation of a winding up petition and before a winding up order has been made the company or any creditor or contributory may a where any suit or proceeding against the company is pending in <ORG> or in <ORG> apply to the Court in which the suit or proceeding is pending for a stay of proceedings therein and where any suit or proceeding is pending against the company in any other Court apply to the Court having jurisdiction to wind up the company to restrain further proceedings in the suit or proceeding and the <ORG> to which application is so made may stay or restrain the proceedings accordingly on such terms as it thinks fit The object of this sub section appears to be to empower the court as in exercise of insolvency jurisdiction to decide all claims made by or against any company and other questions whatsoever so that winding up proceedings might be expedited Sub sections and both seem to have been inserted to give effect to the recommendation of the Company Law Committee Report contained in para namely that all suits by or against a company in winding up should notwithstanding any provisions in any law for the time being in force be instituted in the court in which the winding up proceedings are pending When a winding up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed no suit or other legal proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the <ORG> and subject to such terms as the <ORG> may impose In particular we would refer to Section In that case a company was ordered to be wound up in April and an order of assessment to income tax of the profits made by the company in the year ending May was made in and the Income tax Officer without obtaining leave of the winding up court commenced proceedings for recovery of tax as if it were an arrear of land revenue This expression was not held to cover assessment proceedings to which apparently no objection was raised by the parties though they were represented by eminent counsel The head note which gives a clear idea of the ratio of this decision is in these words The secured creditor is outside the winding up and can realise his security without the leave of the winding up <ORG> though if he files a suit or takes other legal proceedings for the realisation of his security he is bound under Section of the Indian Companies Act to obtain the leave of the winding up <ORG> before he can do so although such leave would almost automatically be granted Held therefore that having regard to the context in which the words any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties added in Section by the amending Act XXII of have been used in juxtaposition with any attachment distress or execution put into force without leave of the <ORG> against the estate or effects it would be a legitimate construction to be put upon them that they refer only to sales held through the intervention of the <ORG> and not to sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the <ORG> and that the amendment was not intended to bring within the sweep of the general words sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up In December the respondent was assessed to tax amounting to Rs In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that Section gave statutory power to Income Tax Officer to set off a refundable amount against any tax remaining payable and that this power was not subject to any provision of any other law The effect of Sections and of the Companies Act is inter alia that an unsecured creditor must prove his debts and all unsecured debts are to be paid pan passu Furthermore if there is an apparent conflict between two independent provisions of law the special provision must prevail It may be recalled that in <ORG> case supra the assessment made after the winding up order was not challenged though on the argument addressed by <NAME> before us it could have been challenged The ratio decidendi or the principle accepted and applied in none of the decisions cited supports the appellant contention on the precise point of assessment of tax There is no justification for extending the scope of this decision beyond its own facts The decisions of <ORG> and of this <ORG> already cited by <NAME> it may be recalled do not support this view We do not think this decision is of any assistance for considering the question whether assessment or re assessment proceedings can be considered to be legal proceedings as contemplated by Section of the Act It may here be pointed out that in that case it was while dealing with Section of the Income tax Act that this Court observed that the revenue could not by exercising the right under that section get priority over other unsecured creditors and it was in this context that it was said that there being apparent conflict between two independent provisions of law the special provision must prevail Turning now to the Income tax Act it is noteworthy that Section occurs in Chapter XIV which beginning with Section prescribes the procedure for assessment and Section provides for assessment or re assessment of income escaping assessment This section empowers the Income tax Officer concerned subject to the provisions of Sections to to assess or re assess escaped income There are also provisions for reference to <ORG> and for appeals from the decisions of <ORG> to <ORG> and then there are provisions for revision by the Commissioner of Income tax Incidentally it may be pointed out that at the bar no English decision was brought to our notice under which the assessment proceedings were held to be controlled by the winding up court For the foregoing reasons we have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal with costs
