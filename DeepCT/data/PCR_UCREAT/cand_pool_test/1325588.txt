In this case at the instance of the assessee the following two questions have been referred to us for our opinion Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case conclusion reached by the <ORG> in holding that the assessee did not commence its business prior to June and consequently not entitled to expenditure incurred by it amounting to Rs For assessment year it submitted its return for the period November to December showing a loss of Rs The assessee took the matter in appeal but the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the view of the Income tax Officer and dismissed the appeal The matter was taken in further appeal before the <ORG> According to the <ORG> the point which required decision in this case was whether the assessee company could be said to have commenced its business activities from the beginning of the accounting period viz The <ORG> held that the decision of the Income tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was correct namely that the assessee did not commence its business prior to June and hence there was no necessity to change that conclusion Thereafter at the instance of the assessee the questions set out hereinabove have been referred to us for our opinion In this connection there are several decisions specifying what can be said to be the date of setting up of the business ITR SC <ORG> referred to the decision of Chagla in <ORG> case ITR Bom ITR Guj a Division Bench of this High Court has held there is a clear distinction between commencing a business and setting it up The business would commence when the activity which is first in point of time and which must necessarily precede all other activities is started It claimed the expenditure incurred for the purpose of extracting limestone as also depreciation and development rebate for the machinery installed for that purpose for assessment years and The expenditure incurred by the assessee in carrying on the activity of extraction of limestone as also depreciation allowance and development rebate in respect of machinery employed in extracting limestone were deductible in computing the trading profits of the assessee for assessment years and The business would commence when the activity which is first in point of time and which must necessarily precede the other activities is started Can it be said in such a case that when the assessee purchases goods for the purpose of sale he does not commence his business Is it necessary that he must start the activity of selling goods before he can be said to have commenced his business We have to consider the question as to when an assessee can be said to have commenced business from a common sense point of view We have to ask ourselves the question as to when a businessman would regard a business as being commenced Would he not consider a business as having commenced when an assential activity of that business is started The argument of the revenue seeks to confound the commencement of a business with the estabment of the business as a whole and carrying on of all the activities of the business In the instant case we find from the memorandum and articles of association of the company that under the objects clause of the company the object of the company is to carry on the business of manufacture buy or otherwise acquire sell import export distribute deal in and dispose of and turn to account produce ACSR all aluminium and copper conductors aluminium and copper binding wires strips covered conductor and all types of wires cables telephonic and telegraphic cables and underground cables and all other materials used in the manufacture of the above items as dealers in or manufacturers of any other articles or things of a character similar or analogous to the foregoing or any of them or connected therewith Article of the articles of association is included in the articles dealing with capital and the marginal note is Taking over a concern The balance sheet disclosed that the company had given a counter guarantee to <ORG> for guarantee given by bank for Rs for purchase of two cars and a further counter guarantee to Central <ORG> for guarantee given to various <ORG> of Rs It is true that in the auditors report it was stated that depreciation was not claimed but as Mr <NAME> explained since there was no production depreciation could not be claimed Over and above these contracts other contracts were also secured by the company before it actually started production as shown in annexure to the statement of the case and by the time it was ready to commence the business it had already secured orders worth Rs In the instant case the company has started securing orders well in advance of the date on which it actually started production of aluminium conductors All the time we have to bear in mind that the test is of commonsense and what in the eye of a businessman can be said to be the commencement of the business was being attended to and when the company was ready to go into production it actually started production and supplied goods against the orders which it had already booked The <ORG> was therefore in error in not analysing the activities of the assessee company in the instant case into the essential components of that business activity and ascertaining whether one or the other of those component activities had commenced before the actual date of going into production
