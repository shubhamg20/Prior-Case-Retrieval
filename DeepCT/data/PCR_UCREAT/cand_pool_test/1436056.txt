Section created a liability irrespective of the considerations arising from the general provisions of the income tax law Appeal from the judgment and order dated August of <ORG> in Income tax Reference No of No appeal has been filed on behalf of the <ORG> and the second of the two questions must be taken to be finally settled in this case It was said nextly that <ORG> was in error in construing of the Finance Act as a provision which created a liability proprio vigore as if it was a charging section It was contended that the repayment was not within the taxable territory and in view of the answer to the second question as to the applicability of A there could be no tax upon it Where any person has paid excess profits duty the amount so paid shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits or gains of the year which included the end of the accounting period in respect of which the excess profits duty has been paid but where any person has received repayment of any amount previously paid by him by way of excess profits duty the amount repaid shall be treated as profit for the year in which the repayment is received The problem which arose in the case of repayment of Excess Profits Duty was different However belated his fruition of them they have not lost their original character as trading profits The Master of the Rolls described the amount received as repayment in these words But in respect of what is that payment made It is not a legacy it is not a sum which has fallen from the skies it is a sum which is repaid because there was too large a sum paid by the <ORG> to the Revenue Authorities over the whole period during which Excess Profits Duty was paid and that sum means and is intended to represent a repayment of a sum which was paid by them in respect of the duty charged upon the excess profits of their trading Dealing with the rule the Master of the Rolls observed I have pointed out this is a case where the Company has received payment of an amount previously paid by way of Excess Profits Duty and having that characteristic attaching to it and we are told by the Statute that when such a sum is repaid it is to be treated as a profit for the year in which the repayment is received The answer to my mind is that it is paid back not by way of a sum which has no origin or ancestry it is a sum which represents a repayment of the amount previously paid by that company in the form of Excess profits duty upon their trading The following passage in the speech of Lord <NAME> explaining the extent of the fiction in the latter part of the Rule is extremely instructive The express mandatory terms of the sentence show in carefully chosen language that he is to submit to something by reason of his having previously enjoyed this advantage in the shape of repayment of an amount previously paid by way of Excess Profits Duty Something which is not a profit but is only a money repayment something which may not result in a profit because although trading goes on there is so great a loss on the year that this repayment does not make up the deficit something which may not be a trading profit because trading has ceased altogether nevertheless is to be treated as profit and as profit for the year These cases were relied on by <NAME> and <NAME> in the judgment under appeal and the learned Judges pointed out that the addition of the words for the purposes of assessment to income tax and super tax rather strengthen the reasoning in its application to the words of the Indian Statute By the first fiction it makes the amount of any repayment income for the purposes of the Indian Income tax Act and goes on to say that that income shall be treated for purposes of assessment to income tax and super tax as the income of the previous year Mr <NAME> for the <ORG> contends that no doubt the amount may be treated as income for the purposes of the Indian Income tax Act but the <ORG> is still under a duty to prove that the <ORG> is liable to tax at all incomes within and without taxable territories is made unnecessary by demanding that this amount by way of repayment shall be brought to tax and treated as income within the previous year
