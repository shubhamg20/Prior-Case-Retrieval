DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> CJ BENCH <NAME> CJ SHELAT BHARGAVA VISHISHTHA HEGDE GROVER A CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO SC RF SC SC RF SC RF SC RF SC SC RF SC RF SC SC SC SC SC RF SC SC RF SC SC SC ACT Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act Levy of rate on tax and buildings Rate held not to include tax on capital value or percentage of capital value Defect sought to be removed by Gujarat Imposition of Taxes by Municipalities Validation Act Enactment of of Gujarat Municipalities Act to give power to municipalities to levy tax on capital value or percentage of capital value of lands and buildings Power of State Legislature under item List II of Seventh Schedule to Constitution levy tax on capital value of buildings Efficacy of Validating Act Principles on which retrospective validation can be upheld HEADNOTE Section of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act allows the municipality to levy a rate on building or lands or both situate within the municipality It filed writ petitions in <ORG> challenging the said assessments The most important condition is that the legislature must possess the power to impose the tax for if it does not the action must ever remain ineffective and illegal A <ORG> decision must always bind unless the conditions on which it is based are so fundamentally altered that the decision could not have been given in the altered circumstances If the legislature has the power over the subject matter and competence to make a valid law it can at ii After this <ORG> decision in <NAME> case it could no longer be questioned that <ORG> had power under entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution to levy a tax on the capital value of lands and buildings Next it provided that the tax must be deemed to be validly assessed imposed collected or recovered and the imposition must be deemed to be always so authorised The legislature by this enactment retrospectively imposed the tax on lands and buildings based on their capital value and as the tax was already imposed levied and collected on that basis made the imposition levy collection and recovery of the tax valid notwithstanding the declaration by the court that as rate the levy was incompetent The legislature not only equated the tax collected to a tax on lands and buildings which it had the power to levy but also to a rate giving a new meaning to the word rate Sup I and while doing so it put out of action the effect of the decisions of the courts to the contrary The exercise of power by the legislature was valid because the legislature does possesses the power to levy a tax on lands and buildings based on capital value thereof and in validating the levy on that basis the implication of the word rate could be effectively removed and the tax on lands and buildings imposed instead During the pendency of the writ petitions the legislature of Gujarat passed the Gujarat Imposition of Taxes by Municipalities Validation Act The appellants also filed a second writ petition questioning the validity of the Validation Act under Arts Dealing with the word rate as used in these statutes it was held by this Court that the word rate had acquired a special meaning in English legislative history and practice and also in Indian legislation and it meant a tax for local purposes imposed by local authorities It was discussed in the case that there were three methods by which the rates could be imposed the first was to take into account the actual rent fetched by the land or building where it was actually let the second was The Act came into force on January Notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment decree or order of a Court or <ORG> or any other authority no tax or rate assessed or purporting to have been assessed by a municipality under the relevant municipal law or any rules made thereunder on the basis of the capital value of a building or land as the case may be or on the basis of a percentage of such capital value or recovered by the municipality commencement of this Act shall be deemed to invalidly assessed imposed collected or recovered by reason of the assessment being based on the capital value or the percentage of the capital value and not being based on the annual letting value of the building or land as the case may be and the imposition collection and recovery of the tax or rate so assessed and the provisions of the rules made under the relevant municipal law under which the tax or rate was so assessed shall be valid and shall be deemed always to have been valid and shall not be called in question merely on the ground that the assessment of the tax or rate on the basis of the capital value of the building or land as the case may be or on the basis of a percentage of such capital value was not authorised by law and accord ingly any tax or rate so assessed before the commencement of this Act and leviable for a period prior to such commencement but not collected or recovered before such commencement may be collected and recovered in accordance with the relevant municipal law and the rules made thereunder If this section is valid then the imposition cannot be questioned and the short question which arises in this case is as to the validity of this section It is not denied that a legislature does possess the power to validate statutes and to pass retrospective laws This is the only point which falls for consideration in these appeals The most important condition of course is that the legislature must possess the power to impose the tax for if it does not the action must ever remain ineffective and illegal A court decision must always bind unless the conditions on which it is based are so fundamentally altered that the decision could not have been given in the altered circumstances If the legislature has the power over the subject matter and competence to make a valid law it can at any time make such a valid law and make it retrospectively so as to bind even past transactions That entry reads Taxes on lands and buildings and a tax on lands and buildings based upon capital value falls squarely within the entry It is pointed out that unlike the tax contemplated by entry List II the tax under entry List is not a direct tax on lands and buildings but on net assets the components of which may be lands and buildings and other items of assets excluding such liabilities as may exist It was held by this Court it did not because the word rate had acquired a special meaning in legislative practice Faced with this situation the legislature exercised its undoubted powers of redefining rate so as to equate it to a tax on capital value and convert the tax purported to be collected as a rate into a tax on lands and buildings Next it provided that the tax must be deemed to be validly assessed imposed collected or recovered and imposition must be deemed to be always so authorised The legislature by this enactment retrospectively imposed the tax on lands and buildings based on their capital value and as the tax was already imposed levied and collected on that basis made the imposition levy collection and recovery of the tax valid notwithstanding the declaration by the <ORG> that as rate the levy was incompetent The legislature not only equated the tax collected to a tax on lands and buildings which it had the power to levy but also to a rate giving a new meaning to the expression rate and while doing so it put out of action the effect of the decisions of the courts to the contrary The exercise of power by the legislature was valid because the legislature does possess the power to levy a tax on lands and buildings based on capital value thereof and in validating the levy on that basis the implication of the use of the word rate could be effectively removed and the tax on lands and buildings imposed instead
