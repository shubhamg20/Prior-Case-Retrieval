The first petitioner <ORG> represented by its Secretary the other petitioners its members challenged the Notification issued by the Commissioner and Special Officer <ORG> under of the A Slum Improvement Acquisition of Land Act of hereinafter called the Act It is averred in the petition that the land was acquired for the purpose of constructing houses and the members have constructed houses at considerable cost and there are disputes about the land and in view of the disputes regarding land proceedings under of the Cr The application was opposed not only by the Commissioner and <ORG> but also by some of the parties who were added as party respondents supporting the notification stating that it is highly essential to declare the land in question as slum area and that the petitioners themselves have no right to question the notification The Act is intended for the acquisition of lands in slum areas and the preamble declares that it was noticed that there are slum areas in almost every town in the State of A which are a source of danger to public health and sanitation and it was felt that I has not been possible to provide for the basic needs of sewerage water supply and road and side drains in these slum areas without causing excessive financial strain on the owners of the lands affected and hence the Act is intended to clear those lands in those areas and undertake the execution of works designed to improve those areas The Act is made applicable in the entire State of A>P The said section provides that a notice should be issued to the Municipality for not less than two months before issuing the notification Provided that before publishing such notice the <ORG> shall call upon the owner of or any other person who in the opinion of the <ORG> is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired and after considering the case if any shown by any person interested in the land the <ORG> may pass such orders as they deem fit The jurisdiction of the civil Court is barred under provides that the provisions of the Act can be made applicable to any pending acquisition proceedings We have however no doubt that the expression the person interested would include even the owner of the land It thus provides opportunity to the owner and the person interested in the land to object to the declaration that it is a slum area although such opportunity is given only after the declaration However after laying down the law when pre decisional opportunities can be justified they did not pass any formal order setting aside the order of the <ORG> as the <ORG> has agreed to provide opportunity of being heard post decisionally to the passport holder The learned counsel pressed the dicta in this judgment very much in his favour holding that in that case <ORG> held that the provisions of the Industries Development and Regulation Act providing post decisional opportunity is not sufficient but a pre decisional opportunity must be afforded and such pre decisional opportunity was not excluded by virtue of AA of the Act No doubt under post decisional opportunity is provided under which the <ORG> has power to cancel the order made earlier <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the court held we do not think that it is permissible to interpret any statutory instrument so as to exclude natural justice unless the language of the instrument leaves no option to the court Let us apply these principles to the present case Though the dicta of the Full bench in this regard is not specific I am clearly of the opinion that the Full Bench also took the view that the opportunity is provided to the person interested to show cause against the earlier notification It is argued by the learned counsel that the post decisional opportunity is employ in this case as the authorities have already made a solemn declaration that the area in question is a slum area and the declaration is issued and the statute provides an opportunity to show cause both against the earlier notification and the proposed notification It is urged by the leaned counsel for the petitioner that the power of <ORG> In this case the learned counsel ultimately agreed that this enquiry can be made in the show cause notice issued to them and the authorities are bound to go into the question whether the earlier notification declaring the area as slum area is well founded or not In the result the writ petition fails and the same is dismissed but in the circumstances without costs
