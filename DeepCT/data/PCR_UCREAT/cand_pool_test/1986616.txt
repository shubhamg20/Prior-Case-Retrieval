Rule A of the Rules states that the <NAME> when verifying a surrender of a tenancy by a tenant shall satisfy himself after such inquiry as he thinks fit that the tenant understands the nature and consequences of the surrender and also that it is voluntary and shall endorse his findings in that behalf upon the document of surrender The appellants who were the landlords of certain lands made an application to the <NAME> stating that the tenant was willing to surrender his tenancy in the agricultural land and prayed for verification under of the Bombay Tenancy Act of The tenant thereupon preferred an appeal before the Special Deputy Collector who held that the order passed by the Circle Officer was not an order passed by the <NAME> as required by the tenancy law and as such it was without jurisdiction and void and that there was no verification of the surrender application as required by law The landlords writ petition was dismissed by <ORG> holding that the alleged surrender was a nullity as there was no compliance with the mandatory requirements of of the Bombay Tenancy Act read with A On appeal to this Court it was contended that the provisions of A are directory and not mandatory and that there had been a substantial compliance with the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act and the rule The words provided that read with the words shall be repeatedly used in make the termination of tenancy by surrender entirely subject to the imperative conditions laid down in the proviso He did not say a word that he was satisfied that the tenant had voluntarily made a surrender after understanding its nature and consequences nor did he endorse his satisfaction on the tenants deed of surrender as required by A The requirement as to the recording of its satisfaction by the authority it the manner prescribed by the rule was the substance of the matter and not an empty formality A The rule that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all and that other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden is attracted with full force in this case because non verification of the surrender in the requisite manner would frustrate the very purpose of this provision The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA These appeals by special leave are directed against the common judgment dated of <ORG> dismissing two Writ Petitions filed by the appellants to impugn the orders of <ORG> The material facts are these On September the predecessor of appellants and hereinafter called the landlords made an application to the <NAME> of <ORG> that the tenant Respondent no was willing to surrender his tenancy in the agricultural land bearing Survey No admeasuring acres and Gunthas situated at village Haripur Taluka <ORG> District Sangh in the State of Maharashtra Pursuant to the above order a <ORG> was prepared by the Talati on November in which it was stated that the possession of this tenancy land had been given to the landlord In the alternative he prayed that if he was found to have lost possession the same be restored to him This application was opposed by the landlord and his transferees on two main grounds that the tenant had duly surrendered his tenancy in and he was not in possession thereafter and that his application was time barred Both these rounds found favour with <ORG> and he dismissed the tenant application by an order dated The tenant preferred another appeal also to the Deputy Collector against the order dated of the Circle Officer Mr <NAME> whereby the tenant name was deleted from the record of rights He also set aside the order of the Circle Officer regarding the mutation entry The common question that falls to be determined in these appeals is whether in the circumstances of this case the alleged surrender by the tenant was valid The Deputy Collector and the <ORG> have concurrently answered this question in the negative on the threefold ground i That the so called surrender was a sham transaction because the tenant continued thereafter to be in possession and paid rent to the landlord upto ii That Circle Officers were not empowered to dispose of tenancy cases and as such <NAME> order dated September Regarding the third ground it held that the alleged surrender was a nullity as there was no compliance with the mandatory requirements of of the Bombay Tenancy Act read with Rule A in regard to the verification of a surrender The manner of such verification has been prescribed by Rule A in these terms The <NAME> when verifying a surrender of a tenancy by a tenant in favour of the landlord under clause of Subsection of section shall satisfy himself after such enquiry as he thinks fit that the tenant understands the nature and consequences of the surrender and also that it is voluntary and shall endorse his findings in that behalf upon the document of surrender It will be seen from a combined reading of these provisions that a surrender of tenancy by a tenant in order to be valid and effective must fulfil these requirements It must be in writing with the application of the landlord to the <NAME> that the Circle Officer exercising the powers of <NAME> then made an enquiry and recorded the statements of the tenant and the landlord to ascertain whether the surrender had been intelligently and voluntarily made by the tenant and that it was only after verifying the requisite tacts the Officer made the order directing delivery of possession to the landlord and deletion of the tenant name from the record of rights In this connection the learned Counsel drew our attention to this sentence in the judgment of the <ORG> But there is no doubt that the above formalities were gone through before the Circle Officer No universal rule said Lord Campell can be laid down as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience The provisions in these Chapters confer on protected tenants the right to purchase their holdings from their landlords to prevent uneconomic cultivation and to create and encourage peasant proprietorship Disobedience of even one of these mandates would render the surrender invalid and ineffectual Having seen that the requirements of and Rule A are obligatory and not directory it remains to be considered whether these imperatives have been substantially complied with in the manner prescribed and if not what is the consequence of non compliance The question of inherent jurisdiction apart all that the Circle Officer did in this case was that he recorded the statements of the tenant and landlord and made the order which we have reproduced in full earlier in this judgment In other words this requirement as to the recording of its satisfaction by the authority in the manner prescribed by the Rule was the substance of the matter and not an empty formality Next point to be considered is what is the consequence of noncompliance with this mandatory procedure A century ago in <NAME> <NAME> Jassel adopted the rule that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all and that other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden
