DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH DAS CJ BHAGWATI SINHA SUBBARAO WANCHOO JUDGMENT JUDGMENT AIR SC The Judgment was delivered by <NAME> This petition under Art of the Constitution is directed against certain orders passed by officers of <ORG> in <ORG> in respect of <ORG> and prays for an appropriate writ direction or order restraining them from taking possession of the school or in any way interfering with the internal management of the said school In the <ORG> also requested the school authorities that higher salary should be paid to the teachers the <ORG> undertaking to meet the extra cost thus to be incurred The <ORG> order refusing such a temporary injunction restraining the defendants from taking charge of the school was upheld by <ORG> in its revisional jurisdiction by its order dated May Ultimately on July the first petitioner received a letter dated July from the third respondent to the effect that in view of the <ORG> refusal to issue any injunction against the ad hoc committee he as the President of that committee proposed to take charge of the school on August and he requested him to hand over complete charge of the school to the ad hoc committee In answer to the Notice of Motion the th respondent swore an affidavit to the effect that it was not sought to interfere with the property of the school but with the management thereof in the interest of the public that the order dated July was in accordance with the provisions of the Bihar Education Code which had the force of law that the petitioners had failed to obtain an injunction or order from the Courts below in a pending suit in which identical questions has been raised that by the order aforesaid of the Government it was not intended to take over the management of the school but to re constitute an efficient Committee of management After hearing the parties this Court made the following order on September in the stay matter Interim order is made absolute until the disposal of Article Petition which is fixed for final disposal on rd September subject to part heard It is not necessary to set out the allegations made on behalf of the respondents in their affidavit relating to the part played by the first petitioner in founding and running the school or to the proceedings taken against the Head Master or to the many acts of mismanagement on the part of the Managing Committee most of whom are petitioners in this case because this Court is not concerned with the merits of those controversies The only question directly before this Court is whether the petitioners have made out any fundamental right which has been infringed or is threatened to be infringed by the respondents or any one of them Most of those paragraphs have been traversed in the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents either admitting or denying or partly admitting and partly denying the allegations made on behalf of the petitioners The counsel for the respondents was not able to point out any allegations in their affidavits denying those allegations It must therefore be taken for the purposes of this case that the fact is admitted on behalf of the respondents that <ORG> purchased the land and constructed the building for the school on that land and that the <ORG> is the proprietor of the building and the land on which the building stands We must therefore proceed on the assumption that the petitioners are the proprietors of the land and the building of the school as trustees but certainly not as beneficial owners in the sense in which property ordinarily is owned and possessed that was not even claimed on behalf of the petitioners The next question therefore arises whether the respondents can deprive the petitioners of their proprietary rights a the properties aforesaid and whether they have purported to do so by any process known to law It is claimed on behalf of the respondents that due to the failure of <ORG> to carry out the directions of <ORG> and the <ORG> the <ORG> appointed an ad hoc Committee to take over the management of the school and that this step was taken by the <ORG> in accordance with the amended Art Article of the Code is headed withdrawal or withholding of recognition and runs as follows Recognition shall only be withdrawn or withheld for reasons to be recorded in writing and on one of the following grounds a that the school does not follow the course of study prescribed or approved by the department that it has committed a willful breach of the transfer rules that it has not attained or does not attain to a reasonable standard of efficiency that it does not maintain a satisfactory standard of discipline or employs any teacher who takes part in political agitatiun directed against the authority of Government or who endeavours to inculcate opinions tending to excite feelings of political disloyalty or disaffection among the pupils or to create hatred between the different classes at His Majesty subjects or that it appears to the authority empowered to grant recognition for any other reason to be injurious to the interest of education If recognition is refused to a school under the control of a municipality a copy of the orders should be sent to the chairman of the municipality It is not necessary for us to pronounce upon the controversy raised on behalf of the petitioners founded on the Note under the original Art We shall proceed on the assumption that Art of the Constitution then the petitioners cannot be deprived of their right to hold the properties as trustees by a mere fiat of the officials of <ORG> Though in the affidavits sworn on behalf of the respondents it was claimed that the provisions of the Bihar Education Code had the force of law it has been conceded by the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the respondents that he could not justify that contention of the Code has no greater sanction than an administrative order or rule and is not based on any statutory authority or other authority which could give it the force of law The only other question which remains to be determined is whether the petitioners have made out any grounds for interference by this <ORG> with the orders passed by the respondents and impugned in this case The respondents must pay the petitioners the costs of this petition
