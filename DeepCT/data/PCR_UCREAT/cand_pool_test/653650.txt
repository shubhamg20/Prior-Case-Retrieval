There is a clear distinction between the provisions of and of the Indian Penal Code and the two sections are not to be confused The principal element in of the Indian Penal Code is the common intention to commit a crime There is no question of common intention in of the Indian Penal Code An offence may be committed by a member of an unlawful assembly and the other members will be liable for that offence although there was no common intention between that person and the other members of the unlawful assembly to commit that offence provided the conditions laid down in the section are fulfilled Thus if the offence committed by that person is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object every member of the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that offence although there may have been no common intention and no participation by the other members in the actual commission of that offence There is a difference between object and intention for although the object may be common the intentions of the several members of the unlawful assembly may differ and indeed may be similar only in one respect namely that they are all unlawful while the element of participation in action which is the leading feature of is replaced in by membership of the assembly at the time of the committing of the offence is for a distinct and separate offence from that under section read with section or section read with section etc A person charged with an offence read with cannot be convicted of the substantive offence without a specific charge being framed as required by of the Code of Criminal Procedure There was no room for the application of of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the facts of the present case The provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure can apply only in cases where there is no doubt about the facts which can be proved but a doubt arises as to which of several offences have been committed on the proved facts in which case any number of charges can be framed and tried or alternative charges can be framed In the present case there was no doubt about the facts and if the allegation against the appellant that he had caused the injuries to the deceeased with takwa was established by evidence then there could be no doubt that the offence of murder had been committed In the present case there was no question of any error omission or irregularity in the charge within the meaning of of the Code of Criminal Procedure because no charge under of the Indian Penal Code was in fact framed There was an illegality in the present case and not an irregularity which was curable by the provisions of ss and of the Code of Criminal Procedure Assuming however that there was merely an irregularity which was curable the irregularity in the circumstances of the case was not curable because the appellant was misled in his defence by the absence of a charge under of the Indian Penal Code The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal by <NAME> comes by special leave against the judgment of the Punjab <ORG> In <ORG> the appellant along with others was charged under section and section read with section of the Indian Penal Code He acquitted the other three accussed There was an appeal by three convicted persons to <ORG> and the high court convicted the appellant alone under section of the Indian Penal Code confirming the sentence of death but altered the conviction of the other accused from section to section Indian Penal Code The principal question of law to be considered is as to whether the appellant could legally be convicted for murder and sentenced under section Indian Penal Code when he was not charged with that offence Section of the Indian Penal Code creates a specific offence and it is a separate offence from the offence of murder punishable under section of the Indian Penal Code Off behalf of the Prosecution however it was urged that section did not create any offence at all and therefore no separate charge was obligatory under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that in any event the provisions of sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure did apply and the appellant could have been convicted and sentenced under section of the Indian Penal Code although no charge for the substantive offence of murder had been framed against him I Cal It is necessary therefore to examine the provisions of section of the Indian Penal Code and consider as to whether this section creates a specific offence Under this section a person who is a member of an unlawful assembly is made guilty of the offence committed by another member of the same assembly in the circumstances mentioned in the section although he had no intention to commit that offence and had done no overt act except his presence in the assembly and sharing the common object of that assembly Under this section a person need not be a member of an unlawful assembly and yet he would be guilty of being a member of an unlawful assembly and guilty of an offence which may be committed by a member of the unlawful assembly in the circumstances mentioned in the section Section creates an offence and the person convicted of this offence is liable in certain circumstances to be punished in the same manner as a person convicted of the principal offence Sections and to of the Indian Penal Code also create offences and a person convicted under any one of them would be liable to be punished in the same manner as if he had given false evidence It was however urged on behalf of the Prosecution that section merely provides for constructive guilt similar to section of the Indian Penal Code There is a clear distinction between the provisions of sections and of the Indian Penal Code and the two sections are not to be confused The principal element in section of the Indian Penal Code is the common intention to commit a crime There is no question of common intention in section of the Indian Penal Code An offence may be committed by a member of an unlawful assembly and the other members will be liable for that offence although there was no common intention between that person and other members of the unlawful assembly to commit that offence provided the conditions laid down in the section are fulfilled Thus if the offence committed by that person is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object every member of the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that offence although there may have been no common intention and no participation by the other members in the actual commission of that offence He pointed out that there was a difference between object and intention for although the object may be common the intentions of the several members of the unlawful assembly may differ and indeed may be similar only in respect that they are all unlawful while the element of participation in action which is the leading feature of section was replaced in section by membership of the assembly at the time of the committing of the offence These decisions support the contention that it will be illegal to convict an accused of the substantive offence under a section without a charge being framed if he was acquitted of the offence under that section read with section of the Indian Penal Code Two questions were referred to the Full Bench When a charge omits section Indian Penal Code and the conviction is based on the provisions of that section is that conviction necessarily bad or does it depend on whether the accused has or has not been materially rejudiced by the omission When a charge has been framed under sections and Indian Penal Code is a conviction under section Indian Penal Code necessarily bad or does this also depend on whether the accused has or has not been materially prejudiced by the form of the charge The Full Bench agreed with the view expressed by Sir <NAME> in the Allahabad case that section created no offence but was like section merely declaratory of a principle of the common law and its object was to make it clear that an accused who comes within that section cannot put forward as a defence that it was not his hand which inflicted the grievous hurt Section creates an offence but the punishment must depend on the offence of which the offender is by that section made guilty After an examination of the cases referred to on behalf of the appellant and the prosecution we are of the opinion that the view taken by <ORG> is the correct view namely that a person charged with an offence read with section cannot be convicted of the substantive offence without a specific charge being framed as required by section of the Code of Criminal Procedure It was urged by the Prosecution that under the provisions of section and section of the Code of Criminal Procedure a person could be convicted of an offence which he is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it The provisions of section can apply only in cases where there is no doubt about the facts which can be proved but a doubt arises as to which of several offences have been committed on the proved facts in which case any number of charges can be framed and tried or alternative charges can be framed In the present case there is no doubt about the facts and if the allegations against the ap pellant that he bad caused the injuries to the deceased with takwa was established by evidence then there could be no doubt that the offence of murder bad been committed There was no room for the application of section of the Code of Criminal Procedure It had been argued on behalf of the prosecution that no finding or sentence pronounced shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed Reliance was placed on the provisions of section of the code of criminal procedure Reference was also made to the provisions of section of that Code The explanation to the section no doubt directs that the court shall have regard to the fact that the objection could and should have been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings In the present case however there is no question of any error omission or irregularity in the charge because no charge under section of the Indian Penal Code was in fact framed dure permits an appellate court or a court of revision if satisfied that any person convicted of an offence was misled in his defence in the absence of a charge or by an error in the charge to direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit In the present case we are of the opinion that there was an illegality and not an irregularity curable by the provisions of sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure Assuming however for a moment that there was merely an irregularity which was curable we are satisfied that in the circum stances of the present case the irregularity is not curable because the appellant was misled in his defence by the absence of a charge under section of the Indian Penal Code By framing a charge under section read with section of the Indian Penal Code against the appellant the Court indicated that it was not charging the appellant with the offence of murder and to convict him for murder and sentence him under section of the Indian Penal Code was to convict him of an offence with which he had not been charged It was urged that if a specific charge for murder had been framed against the appellant he would have questioned the doctor more closely about the incised injuries on the head of the deceased as well as the prosecution witnesses The appeal is accordingly allowed and the conviction and the sentence of the appellant is set aside and the case of the appellant is remanded to the court of <ORG> at Jullundur for retrial after framing a charge under section of the Indian Penal Code and in accordance with law
