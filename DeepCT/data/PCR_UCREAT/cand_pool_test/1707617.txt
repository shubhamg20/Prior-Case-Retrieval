Mr <NAME> went with four of his officers to the residence of Mr <NAME> while the Deputy Commissioner went with Commercial Tax Officers Mr <NAME> Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> Joint Commercial Tax Officer thirteen other officers and a few peons to the office and factory of <ORG> The Deputy Commissioner wanted to get at the records in the suit case to verify whether there was any attempt to evade payment of taxes due to the department and also wanted to make a general inspection of the place of business of the company There was a crowd of employees blocking the path Mr <NAME> was man handled and pushed down by the officers and he sustained injuries on his knee cap But we have referred to the facts as mentioned by the Deputy Commissioner or by Mr <NAME> to show that <ORG> of <ORG> searched the premises of <ORG> found out the leather suit case forcibly removed it in spite of objection and physical resistance and took it away with certain other records and that this raid was carried out as the Deputy Commissioner as he claimed had specific information that the suit case contained secret account books relating to the various businesses in which one Mr <NAME> was interested and was hidden in the business premises of <ORG> before its being airlifted to Bombay He also asked for an injunction restraining the respondents from disclosing the information therein and making any use thereof His grounds are that the warrant was obtained on fraudulent misrepresentation by the Deputy Commissioner the nd respondent through Mr <NAME> for the ulterior purpose of tracing the box of one Mr <NAME> containing secret accounts of his many businesses that the Madras General Sales Tax Act does not give a power to search but only a power of inspection that the proviso to Section for search of a residential building goes beyond the main provision relating to inspection that when there is no provision for search of even business premises there cannot be a search of a private residence and that if the proviso is construed as conferring a power of search it offends Article of the Constitution In the counter affidavit of the Deputy Commissioner Mr <NAME> filed in this petition it is stated on behalf of the three respondents that they have no objection to the return of the documents in which the petitioner is interested by the Sub Divisional Magistrate <NAME> to <ORG> from whose possession the Commercial Tax Officer II recovered them The officers by these notices informed the petitioner that before ordering confiscation they were willing under the powers conferred on them by law to give him the option to pay in lieu of confiscation a sum of Rs In answer to these notices the petitioner filed objections which were all overruled by the two officers holding that the goods were unaccounted stock liable to confiscation under Section of the Act and renewed the option contained in the notices to pay the penalties before a specified time in lieu of confiscation They also issued notices in Form under the Rules to the petitioner on the same day The respondents have filed counter affidavits denying these grounds Mr <NAME> for the petitioners argues that there is no power of search under the Madras General Sales Tax Act but if there is it is invalid so that the seizures from search in these cases are illegal and makes his submission under three heads construction of Section by itself and in the light of the other provisions of the Act if the section is construed as empowering search its legislative competency with reference to the topic of tax on sale of goods and if the power exists it offends Articles and and of the Constitution They will be dealt with in that order Section authorises search or inspection under and in accordance with a warrant issued by a court having jurisdiction on its being satisfied that the circumstances in which it may issue exist Sections to make general provisions relating to searches and prescribe the procedure to be followed in search and seizure Section empowers a police officer to search a person while arresting him in connection with a cognizable offence Under Section all offences under the Indian Penal Code should be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code and under Sub section all offences under any other law should be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions but subject to the enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences Often fiscal statutes for their effective enforcement create offences and make special provisions prescribing the procedure for investigation trial and punishment We have referred to these matters as during the argument before us for the petitioners stress was laid on the scope and nature of the power and procedure of search and seizure with or without a warrant and the safeguards in respect thereof under the Code of Criminal Procedure and it was stated that the court should bear them in mind both in interpreting Section of the Madras General Sales Tax Act and considering its constitutional validity The Madras General Sales Tax Act which will hereafter be referred to as the Act repealed the Madras General Sales Tax Act consolidated and amended the laws relating to the levy of a general tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the State of Madras and came into force on st April Section which we are called upon to construe and interpret reads Powers to order production of accounts and powers of entry inspection etc Any officer empowered by the Government in this behalf may for the purposes of this Act require any dealer to produce before him the accounts registers records and other documents and to furnish any other information relating to his business All accounts registers records and other documents maintained by a dealer in the course of his business the goods in his possession and his offices shops godowns vessels or vehicles shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by such officer Provided that no residential accommodation not being a place of business cum residence shall be entered into and searched by such officer except on the authority of a search warrant issued by a Magistrate having jurisdiction over the area and all searches under this sub section shall so far as may be be made in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Central Act of If any such officer has reason to suspect that any dealer is attempting to evade the payment of any tax fee or other amount due from him under this Act he may for reasons to be recorded in writing seize such accounts registers records or other documents of the dealer as he may consider necessary and shall give the dealer a receipt for the same Any such officer shall have power to seize and confiscate any goods which are found in any office shop godown vessel vehicle or any other place of business or any building or place of the dealer but not accounted for by the dealer in his accounts registers records and other documents maintained in the course of his business Provided that before ordering the confiscation of goods under this sub section the officer shall give the person affected an opportunity of being heard and make an inquiry in the prescribed manner Provided further that the officer ordering the confiscation shall give the person affected option to pay in lieu of confiscation a in cases where the goods are taxable under this Act in addition to the tax recoverable a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees or double the amount of tax recoverable whichever is greater and in other cases a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees and in the event of a second or subsequent conviction simple imprisonment which may extend to six months or a fine which may extend to two thousand rupees or both The section also provides that any person who prevents or obstructs entry search or seizure by any officer empowered under Section shall on conviction be liable to simple imprisonment which may extend to six months or a fine which may extend to two thousand rupees or both There is no dispute that the power to issue such a warrant is under the Code of Criminal Procedure The proviso does assume that such officer has a power upon which it puts a fetter So Subsection includes a power of search and there is no need to resort to the proviso It is taking with force possession of something contrary to the wishes of its owner or possessor See <NAME> <ORG> Suppl A mere power of inspection will not therefore take with it a power to seize unlike a search which often particularly as seen from the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure includes a power of seizure If Sub section is taken by itself which follows the power to call for production in the preceding Sub section there is no reason as far as we have been able to see why we should import into it a power of search There is nothing in the context or terms of Sub section or other Sub sections all read together and harmoniously which compels us to do so It is an elementary rule of construction that words in a statute are primarily to be construed in their ordinary meaning or common or popular sense unless such a construction would lead to manifest and gross absurdity or unless the context requires some special or particular meaning to be given to the words Again in paragraph therein it is pointed out The words of a statute are to be taken as used in their ordinary sense and it is therefore permissible in ascertaining the ordinary sense of particular words to refer to dictionaries Does then the proviso to Sub section make any difference We have reached the conclusion it does not Observed <NAME> at page It satisfies the words whilst the other view gives to the proviso a meaning which I think would be most formidable not merely with reference to the question which now is under debate before your Lordships but also as a matter of construction that a proviso could be so read as to suggest that the previous part of the section of which it is a proviso should imply by law the existence of words there of which there is not a trace in the previous words of the section itself A points out It is immaterial that <ORG> in enacting the legislation of and may have assumed that there was a pre existing right to make such deductions on income tax principles since there is a distinction between <ORG> accepting an erroenous opinion as to the existing law and its enacting that the law shall be changed On our construction of Sub section and its proviso the further question that if there was a power of search how far the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be applicable does not arise He would add that Sub section does not include seizure because if it does a separate Sub section in relation to seizure will be unnecessary which we however find in Section were of the view that those words by which the provisions of Chapter XLI of the Code were made applicable to appeals from appellate decrees must be taken to mean as far as is consistent with the principles on which appeals from appellate decrees are admitted and determined They of course visualised the possibility that those words could be understood in the wider sense of as far as possible but in the context they preferred the narrower meaning The actual words used by Section are that the Magistrate may issue a search warrant therein and the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relating to the seraches under that Code shall so far as the same are applicable apply to searches under that Sub section That as we understand is also the test applied by <ORG> in those cases in the light of the specific or special provisions in the particular enactments with which it was concerned It was for that reason thought in that case that there was no reason why conditions should be imposed in the matter of a search by the police officer under Section of the Code but no such safeguard need be provided in the case of a search by the excise officer under the Rules On that view Section A of the Indian Income tax Act was upheld as within the purview of the said entry on the ground that it was a provision to prevent evasion of tax If there is any likelihood of a loophole the taxing power should necessarily include the power to plug it by requisite legislative provision Even so there is a limit to such incidental or ancillary power flowing from the legislative entries in the various Lists in the Seventh Schedule These incidental and ancillary powers have to be exercised in aid of the main topic of legislation <ORG> held Section A of the Orissa Sales Tax Act as within the power to tax on sale of goods which provided that refund of tax could be claimed only by the person from whom the dealer had realised the amount by way of sales tax or otherwise The question of ancillary nature or character of such provisions will have to be decided therefore with respect to the circumstances of the particular legislation its objective and scope vis a vis the particular legislative head or topic or power Mr <NAME> however urges that the power to search and confiscate goods cannot in any case be regarded as ancillary or necessary But it is said that after all they may not be sold and further they are not contraband or offending goods to be seized and confiscated as under <ORG> Where import of goods is forbidden but they are smuggled in across the customs barrier without payment of duty or a ship vehicle or other thing is used in smuggling a power to seize and confiscate offending goods ship or thing may be essentially ancillary to the law relating to customs But we are unable to see how a power of seizure and confiscation of goods is or can be ancillary or incidental to the power to tax the sale or purchase of goods even from the standpoint of checking evasion or making evasion unprofitable <ORG> observed The <ORG> cannot under Entry of List II make a provision to the effect that even though a certain amount collected is not a tax on the sale or purchase of goods as laid down by the law it will still be collected as if it was such a tax We are therefore of opinion that the provision cannot be justified even as an incidental or ancillary provision permitted under that entry Though there is no analogy to the present context the principle of this decision is clear that what has been properly a subject within the ambit of a legislative head of power including ancillary and incidental powers flowing therefrom cannot be indirectly legislated upon under the guise of making a law which might otherwise be within the limits of the legislative head of power The proviso uses the expression where the goods are taxable under the Act but we can find no provision in the Act which makes the goods taxable Apart from this fallacy there is no indication in the proviso that as it speaks of in addition to the tax recoverable it is related to any actual sale or purchase chargeable under the Act But that is not the case under the proviso and our attention has not been drawn to any provision for any such adjustment at the proper time of the first component under Clause a paid in lieu of confiscation Lastly we come to the contention of the petitioners based on Articles and of the Constitution The powers conferred on these officers are greater than those conferred on the police We have to consider the problem in the context of the guaranteed rights of a citizen under Article i and and the violation of which can only be justified as a reasonable restriction in public interest This was on the ground A search and seizure is only a temporary interference with the right to hold the property searched and the articles seized If the officer wants to seize the records he has to record his reasons in writing and when he seizes he has to give to the dealer a receipt for what he has seized The majority view in Assam was based on the following grounds a invasion of the fundamental right not as a result of enforcement of any judicial process or warrant of <ORG> Sub section of Section contains no indication of the object and purpose for which the power of search can be exercised and there is no nexus between the two when and in what circumstances the power is to be exercised there is no indication in respect of which persons and whose premises is not stated no principle or policy is indicated to guide the exercise of the power no opportunity is provided for to contest the validity of the exercise of power no opportunity is given to the affected person to make representations against the proposed search no notice is to be given before exercise of the power and i there is no provision for the return of books which have been seized The Calcutta High <ORG> repelled the argument that the Sub section left the exercise of a drastic power to the decision of the executive and that it made no provision for hearing or representation before or after search or appeal from seizure and for return of documents The <ORG> upheld the validity of the power on the view a exercise of the power is made subject to any rules made in that behalf the Commissioner of Income tax a high official in the hierarchy has been entrusted with the power to specifically authorise any Income tax Officer to enter and search the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure applying to searches are made applicable so far as may be to searches under Section the Commissioner is to authorise an officer specifically in each case and not generally such authorisation by the Commissioner will be on examination of the reasons of the Income tax Officer for his belief that any books of account or other documents which in his opinion will be useful or relevant to the proceedings under the provisions of the Income tax Act may be found and while authorising an Income tax Officer the Commissioner will naturally specify the premises which the former is authorised to enter and search <ORG> referring to the purpose of the Act as disclosed by its preamble and the definition of an industrial dispute taken with the rest of the provisions relating to adjudication of various other matters held that the achievement of one or the other objects must guide and control the exercise of the discretion of <ORG> under Section and there was no scope for the argument that the appropriate <ORG> would be in a position to discriminate between one party and the other The section gave power to the Commissioner of Income tax to transfer any case from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another There was no question that this was a discretionary power and <ORG> considered that it was not necessarily discriminatory in its nature Another part of the reasoning on which the decision of <ORG> was founded is There is a broad distinction between discretion which has to be exercised with regard to a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and some other right which is given by the statute If the statute deals with a right which is not fundamental in character the statute can take it away but a fundamental right the statute cannot take away Where for example a discretion is given in the matter of issuing licences for carrying on trade profession or business or where restrictions are imposed on freedom of speech etc It may be seen from these cases that the question of reasonableness or reasonable classification for the purpose of Article or a reasonable restriction for the purpose of Article is approached and decided with reference to the particular object and scope of the provisions of an impugned Act and even to the special facts and circumstances in each case If the officer has unrestrained authority to ignore personal liberties the product is a police State if he is barred from any interference with private rights the result is criminal anarchy In order to avert these alternative perils and their intermediate gradations it is the responsibility of the Judge and the lawmaker to establish rules for law enforcement which will give society maximum protection from the criminal with a minimum of interference with individual liberties When we are on the question of search there is not the slightest doubt that conflict with the interest of <ORG> does arise in relation to the right of search As a matter of fact as we have seen there are cases in which the validity of the power of search and seizure has been upheld even where it is without a warrant Any invasion of the business premises or search and seizure of records and goods from there will affect the right to hold and dispose of the property The right to hold the property will in our view include the right to enjoy that property without interference or disturbance We may take it that the safeguards which the Attorney General pointed out and which we have referred to in the earlier part of this judgment are present in Sub section of Section While there is no doubt that statements of those details before search may serve as a safeguard we cannot say that in order to answer the test of reasonable restriction such details should invariably be given as a condition for the validity of the power of search and seizure Learned Attorney General argues that the power to delegate to officers the authority to search and seize is vested in the <ORG> <ORG> the highest executive authority and it may be trusted to exercise the power reasonably and for the purpose of the Act The power of the Commissioner of Income tax under Section is that in each case brought to his notice he authorises the Income tax Officer to make a search and the officer seizes books of account and records in connection with the proceedings relating to an assessee under the Income tax Act The notification actually made by the <ORG> which is dated rd March in exercise of the powers conferred by Section shows how it has invested the power of search and seizure in all kinds of officers namely all officers of <ORG> not lower in rank than an Assistant Commercial Tax Officer all officers of <ORG> not lower in rank than a Revenue Inspector and all officers of <ORG> not lower in rank than a Sub Inspector The officers so authorised can at their will and whim exercise a power of search and they are not obliged to tell or explain to anyone higher up in the tax department as to why and in what circumstance they happen to exercise the power and the manner of search Sub section no doubt enacts that an officer may for reasons to be recorded in writing seize But it does not say whether he has to record his reasons before or after and if he records his reasons whether he is obliged to forward the same to any higher officer to ensure proper exercise of the power But it was faintly suggested for the <ORG> that there is no fundamental right against a search There it was stated But a search by itself is not a restriction on the right to hold property We are not unmindful of the fact that <NAME> case was concerned with the law relating to executions in England but the passage extracted has a validity quite apart from the context of the particular decision On the view we have taken on the scope and validity of the power of search and seizure under Sub sections and of Section of the Act we do not think it also necessary to decided that question and also the further point for the petitioner that Sub section in any way does not authorize search in the presmises of a dealer A for the books records or goods of a dealer though we see force in the latter point In the affidavit dated th November sworn to by the second respondent the Deputy Commissioner Commercial Taxes in No of he has stated as already noticed by us that the respondents have no objection to the return of the documents there in question by the Sub Divisional Magistrate Poonamalle to <ORG> In view of this there is nothing further to be said on the facts in this petition Though it was stated in the counter affidavit that enquiry also revealed that the petitioner maintained some accounts and records of his business at his residence the facts and circumstances of the case as disclosed in the affidavits and counter affidavit show that the immediate and real purpose was to search for the suit case in those premises Apart from that a perusal of the original search warrant is open to attack that the columns which should be struck out in the printed form and the gaps to be filled therein while issuing the search warrant had not been attended to and that therefore the authority that issued it had not particularly applied its mind to those matters In Ps Nos and of we accept the contention of learned Attorney General that this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution will not review the sufficiency of the reasons in the impugned orders in support of the confiscation of the goods But we are not satisfied that the first respondent in those petitions has given the petitioner a proper and reasonable opportunity to prove before him that the goods seized were properly accounted for in his account books Further there is a clear statement in the affidavit of the petitioner that he has produced all his account books and correspondence before the first respondent not merely purchase vouchers and this averment has not been specifically met by the first respondent in his counter affidavit dated th November in each of the petitions in which we have allowed costs
