The circumstances giving to this appeal are as follows <NAME> respondent was at the material time posted as Superintendent of police Guedaspur In its written statement the state denied its liability to pay any compensation It was added that the officer had taken out the jeep on the road against the instructions of the Inspector General of police and that the superintendent of police Gurdaspur being himself the registered owner of the vehicle could not claim compensation against himself Was the accident due to any negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle or due to any defect in the vehicle involved in the accident after recording the evidence produced by the parties the <ORG> found The accident no doubt took place because the tyres were worn out and had become unserviceable and the driver was not to blame as it was raining that day and the tyres slipped but the driver was negligent in the performance of his duties as he did take the defective vehicle on the road and did not inform his officer about its unserviceable that day This act of the claimant <NAME> and his constable driver in taking out the jeep which was not in a roadworthy condition on that rainy day amounted to an offence under section of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Rules and of the Motor Vehicles Rules Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel for the claimant respondent contends occurred as a result of the negligence of the appellant <ORG> in not replacing the worn out tyres of the government jeep in time despite requisitions made by the claimant secondly even if there was no such negligence the liability of the <ORG> to compensate its servant for an injury sustained by him in the performance of his duty was absolute It is true that there is nothing either in Ss A or of the Motor Vehicles Act which says that compensation can be awarded by <ORG> only when negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle concerned is established They merely substitute the Motor Accidents claims tribunal for the Civil courts for adjudicating claims to compensation in respect of accidents involving death of or bodily injury to persons arising our of the use of motor vehicles They do not deal with the question as to who is to be held liable and in what circumstances if any injury results from an accident For fixing liability in the absence of any specific statutory provision we have to go back to the law of torts according to which generally speaking negligence in causing the accident is essential to hold the negligent person liable It was held that the claimant was not entitled to claim any compensation from the state for the injuries received by him There is nothing on the record to show that the claimant respondent had sent his demand in the prescribed form thereafter On the other hand the controller of stores in his letter Exhibit dated clearly intimated the claimant respondent that further action in the matter could be taken only on respect of his demand on the prescribed indent forms No UF Thus it was not established that there was any negligence on the part of the appellant or its servant the controller of stores in not replacing the worn out tyres of the vehicle in time Indeed there was negligence on the part of the claimant in not making the demand well in time in the prescribed form <ORG> also has not recorded any clear finding that there was negligence on the part of the state in replacing the worn out tyres though it has said that the accident occurred due to the defect in the tyres The knowledge of the claimant about the worn out condition of the tyres can be inferred from the circumstances that he wrote to the controller as far back as the th June that the tyres and tubes of the <ORG> jeep and other transport vehicles were urgently needed by him Any person who drives or cause or allows to be driven in any public place a motor vehicle or trailer while the vehicle or trailer has any defect which such person knows of or could have discovered by the exercise of ordinary care and which is calculated to render the driving of the vehicle a source of danger to persons and vehicles using such place shall be punishable with fine which may extend to two hundred and fifty rupees or if as a result of such defeat an accident is caused causing bodily injury or damage to property with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees with both In an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages in respect of personal injury resulting from the negligence of the defendants it was held that the plaintiff notwithstanding his knowledge of the defect in the starting gear had never undertaken or consented to take upon himself the risks arising from continuing to use the car that he had sustained the injury owing to the personal negligence of the defendants and that not having been guilty of contributory negligence he was entitled to recover The claimant has not alleged much less proved that the official work for which he had to travel on that day was so urgent and paramount that he could not as a devoted and faithful servant of the state avoid and that in the circumstances he had no choice but to use this very defective jeep It is apparent from the letter written by the claimant to the controller that there were several <ORG> transport vehicles under his control Indeed it was never the claimant case that the exigencies of the official mission to be performed by him were so urgent and imminent that he had no choice but to travel in this defective jeep except at the cost of committing dereliction of the official duty and the consequent incurrence of displeasure of the master There was no proof that the master had done some act either by issuing peremptory direction to the servant to use this defective vehicle on that day and thereby expose him to danger or had in any manner put the servant in that dangerous situation which he could not by the exercise of ordinary diligence or discretion avoid that is to say it was under the management of the claimant himself and the accident would not have happened if the claimant who had the management and control used proper care either to get the tyres replaced in time or to avoid using this dangerously unsafe vehicle on that rainy day The rule of res ipsa loquitur which for the sake of convenience maybe called the rule of presumptive negligence on part of the defendant has therefore no application to the facts of the <ORG> case For all the reasons aforesaid I have no hesitation in holding that the claimant was not entitled to any compensation In the result I would allow this appeal and dismiss the claimant application leaving the parties to bear their own costs throughout
