The question which arises in these writ petitions is whether while dealing with a written request made by a secured creditor under Section of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act for short the NPA Act the Chief Judicial Magistrate or the District Magistrate as the case may be is required to give notice to the borrower or any person who may be in possession of secured asset and give him a hearing We have also heard Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners in Criminal Writ Petition No of We have heard them on their request though the petitions in which they are appearing have been disposed of by separate orders We may briefly refer to the facts averred in Criminal Writ Petition No of It appears that since the petitioners failed to repay the debt respondent issued a notice dated under Section of the NPA Act and called upon the petitioners to pay sum of Rs The case of the petitioners further is that respondent filed an application in <ORG> Esplanade Mumbai under Section of the NPA Act praying for assistance to take possession of the said flat The petitioners have challenged the said order in this writ petition Before we deal with the attack on the impugned order we must note that affidavit has been filed by petitioner reiterating that the notice sent by respondent under Section of the NPA Act has been duly replied by the petitioners on Affidavit in reply has been filed on behalf of respondent by Mr <NAME> Asstt Mr <NAME> submitted that this section which speaks of the power of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate District Magistrate for convenience the CMM DM to assist the secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset begins with the words where the possession of secured assets is required to be taken by the secured creditor Mr <NAME> contended that it is implicit in this sentence that the CMM DM has to apply his mind as to whether possession is required to be taken or not There could be cases where after due application of mind it may appear to the CMM DM that it is not necessary to take possession Mr <NAME> submitted that while exercising jurisdiction under Section the CMM DM must see whether there is compliance of Section A Mr <NAME> contended that Section A requires that if on receipt of the notice under Sub section the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable he shall communicate within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for nonacceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower He pointed out that <ORG> has observed that the secured creditor must bear in mind the say of the borrower before process of recovery is initiated and so as to demonstrate that the reply of the borrower to the notice under Section of the NPA Act has been considered applying mind to it the reasons however brief that may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower Mr <NAME> pointed out that <ORG> has also expressed that while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons aggrieved get a fair deal at the hands of those who have been vested with the powers to enforce drastic steps to make recovery In that case it was argued that though the petitioner therein had filed objection to the notice under Section of the NPA Act that objection was not considered by the secured creditor No reasoned reply was given to the secured creditor Mr <NAME> then contended that Section states that no act of the CMM DM in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority Remedy of appeal is provided in Section against measures in Section It is not an appeal against power exercised under Section Mr <NAME> contended that it is true that the NPA Act is enacted keeping in view mounting levels of non performing assets of banks and financial institutions and for reducing non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction At any rate he is exercising quasi judicial powers Therefore notice has to be read in Section Mr <NAME> contended that proceedings contemplated under Section are original proceedings Hence hearing provided under Section assuming objections can be raised to order passed under Section therein is not sufficient Hearing must be given while ordering possession being taken under Section If it is held to be not a judicial power it is at least a quasi judicial power and therefore application of mind to the material questions such as as to whether the asset is secured or not whether there is a simple mortgage or not whether the tenant is lawful or not etc In that case <ORG> was considering the nature of power exercised by the Chief Justices of <ORG> or the Chief Justice of India under Section of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act for short the Arbitration Act Mr <NAME> pointed out that <ORG> has observed in this judgment that normally any tribunal or authority conferred with a power to act under a statute has the jurisdiction to satisfy itself that the conditions for the exercise of that power existed and that the case calls for the exercise of that power <ORG> observed that such an adjudication relating to its own jurisdiction which could be called as decision on jurisdictional facts is not generally final unless it is made so by the Act constituting the tribunal It is really a decision on its own jurisdiction for the exercise of the power conferred by the statute or to perform the duties imposed by the statute <ORG> then observed that while exercising the power or performing the duty under Section of the Arbitration Act the Chief Justice has to consider as to whether the conditions laid down by the section for the exercise of that power or for the performance of that duty exist and therefore while functioning under Section of the Arbitration Act the Chief Justice or the person or institution designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is an arbitration agreement whether the applicant before him is a party whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is to be appointed who is the fit person in terms of the provision <ORG> noted that Section of the Arbitration Act makes his decision on the matters entrusted to him final Mr <NAME> contended that in this case also the CMM DM has to decide whether the preliminary facts enabling him to exercise jurisdiction under Section of the NPA Act exist He referred to Order XXI Rules and of the and contended that sale of the immoveable property in occupation of the judgment debtor takes place before taking possession Mr <NAME> also referred to Section which states that the secured creditor may require by notice in writing from any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money may become due to the borrower to pay him as much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt He pointed out that under Rule a the notice which the authorised officer has to serve on the borrower must include the description of the immoveable property to be sold including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor In such cases the authorised officer may if he thinks fit allow the purchaser to deposit with him the money required to discharge the encumbrances Under Sub Rule on such deposit for discharge of encumbrances the authorised officer may issue notice to the person entitled to the money deposited and take steps to make the payment accordingly and under Sub Rule the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the purchaser free from encumbrances He submitted that the legislature has used the word shall in Rule He must inter alia find out whether there is a valid and subsisting mortgage which is not simple or equitable mortgage whether the secured creditor requires the possession or not etc Mr <NAME> submitted that in the circumstances this <ORG> should direct the <ORG> DM to give hearing to the persons who will be affected by his order and dispossessed Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel pointed out that under Section of the NPA Act no act of the CMM DM done in pursuance of Section can be called in question in any court or before any authority Section states that if DRT on application made under Section or <ORG> on an appeal preferred under Section holds that the possession of secured assets by the secured creditor is not in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act it can direct the secured creditor to return such secured assets to the concerned borrower and the concerned borrower shall be entitled to payment of compensation Mr <NAME> contended that in <ORG> case supra <ORG> has in paragraph clearly stated that Section of the NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the borrower who is under disability has failed to discharge his liability within the period prescribed under Section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one or more of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured assets Mr <NAME> contended that there is no privity of contract between a third party and the secured creditor Mr <NAME> submitted that under Section any person including a borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in Sub section of Section taken by the secured creditor may make an application to the DRT Mr <NAME> submitted that the appeal provided in Section is an illusory appeal <ORG> observed that even if a statute is silent and there are no positive words in the Act or the Rules made thereunder there could be nothing wrong in spelling out the need to hear the parties whose rights and interests are likely to be affected by the orders that may be passed and making it a requirement to follow a fair procedure before taking a decision unless the statutes provides otherwise Mr <NAME> contended that this observation would apply with equal or more force to the judicial powers exercised by the CMM DM under Section of the NPA Act where termination of the membership of members from the council was challenged on the ground that they were not given notice and they were not heard and therefore there was a violation of principles of natural justice This provision according to Mr <NAME> is akin to such provisions found in the Bombay Police Act the Customs Act and such other statutes It does not give finality to the actions but grants only immunity It should have power to give a definite judgment which has finality Mr <NAME> also referred to the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> supra for highlighting the object of the NPA Act Mr <NAME> submitted that the legislature has on purpose excluded hearing to the borrower or third parties and this <ORG> should interpret Section in a manner which will further the object of the NPA Act rather than frustrate it Mr <NAME> however accepted that in a given case of gross injustice this Court can entertain a writ petition and give relief to the affected party Mr <NAME> further submitted that the judgment in <ORG> scase supra has no application to the facts of the present case Interest of the bank becomes absolute once there is a default committed by the borrower The learned Counsel contended that there is no adjudication provided in the NPA Act upto Section In that the <ORG> considers whether interest was created whether it became absolute or not whether it became non performing as per guidelines of <ORG> whether reply was given to the borrower etc Mr <NAME> submitted that <ORG> who deals with these appeals has wide powers under Section of the <ORG> Act and therefore all questions can be considered in the appeal He submitted that Section merely gives immunity to <ORG> Mr <NAME> submitted that under Section no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any proceedings in respect of any matter which <ORG> or <ORG> is empowered to determine under the NPA Act and no injunction shall be granted by any court in respect of any action taken under the NPA Act and the <ORG> Act Mr <NAME> further submitted that Section of the NPA Act gives overriding effect to its provisions Mr <NAME> pointed out that Section gives power to <ORG> to make Rules There is no provision enabling <ORG> to make Rules in respect of Section that is because the CMM DM exercises ministerial power Mr <NAME> then submitted that in <ORG>supra <ORG> has upheld the validity of the NPA Act Mr <NAME> contended that the provisions of the NPA Act have to be interpreted keeping in mind its background and when there is conflict between law and equity it is the law which has to prevail Mr <NAME> submitted that when alternative and efficacious remedy is provided under Section the petitioner cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of this Court where in the context of appeal provided under Section of the DRT Act <ORG> has held that when remedy of appeal was available <ORG> should not have entertained the petition under Article of the Constitution of India In this judgment <ORG> has held that the <ORG> can even go beyond the <ORG> and only fetter that is put on its power is to observe principles of natural justice where the learned single judge has observed that the requirement of natural justice has been expressly provided under Section of the NPA Act and once the rule of natural justice is followed by the procedure under Section of the NPA Act no further notice is required to be given under Section of the NPA Act Mr <NAME> also placed heavy reliance on the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> supra <ORG> observed that the employment of the said two monosyllables is of great jurisprudential import in the same clause dealing with two rights regarding the same burden must have two different imports Mr <NAME> contended that applying this principle to Sub section i of Section while the secured creditor has an option to make a request to the CMM DM the CMM DM shall on such request being made to him take possession of the asset and for securing compliance he may cause force to be used Mr <NAME> further contended that the submission that appeal provided under Section is illusory has been dealt with by <ORG> in <ORG> supra Mr <NAME> contended that there is enough indication in Section A and Explanation to Section that a third party has no right at the stage of Section A that is at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower to make an application to the DRT under Sub section of Section While Section A gives a right only to the borrower to raise an objection and states that the secured creditor has to consider the objection within one week and communicate the non acceptance if any to the borrower the proviso to Sub section A says that the communication of reason shall not confer on the borrower a right to prefer an application to DRT under Section at the stage of communication of reasons Section gives a right of appeal to any person including borrower Explanation states that at the stage of communication of reasons the person including the borrower shall not be entitled to make an application to DRT under Sub section of Section <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent bank in Criminal Writ Petition No of adopted the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners The learned Counsel drew our attention to judgments of the <ORG> where such appeals are entertained and in some cases relief is also given Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for respondent in Writ Petition No of adopted the arguments of the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> who appear for respondent in Criminal Writ Petition No of have submitted written submissions Though in <ORG> case supra <ORG> was considering whether withdrawal of A in terms of the first proviso to Section of the DRT Act is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the NPA Act while dealing with this question <ORG> observed that three points arise for determination Out of the those three points the point which is relevant for the present case is as follows Whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of Section of the NPA Act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immoveable property The NPA Act enables the banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction The NPA Act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale a The DRT Act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies The secured assets could not be liquidated in time The NPA Act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest The NPA Act deals with crystallized liabilities The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors Section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss The NPA Act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied Since Section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability The NPA Act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors interse Section and Section of the NPA Act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the <ORG> and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process The NPA Act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process The NPA Act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i Under Section the <ORG> is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in Section are in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act and the Rules made thereunder If while examining the application under Section the DRT comes to the conclusion that any of the measures taken under Section are not in accordance with NPA Act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower If the <ORG> declares that the recourse taken under Section is in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under Section to recover his secured debt Section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under Section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under Section come in conflict with the <ORG> land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of Section shall override the local law This position stands clarified by Section of the NPA Act which states that the provisions of the NPA Act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the NPA Act Section gives an overriding effect to the NPA Act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it The dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the NPA Act Rule of the said Rules deals with the sale of immoveable secured assets Rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under Rule Rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession The court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree The authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank Hence under Rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under Rule Rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser Rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor This scheme of the NPA Act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession Since scheme of Section read with Section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act the DRT is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession The disputes which are sought to be avoided by Rule read with Rule of the said Rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice If any reply is submitted by the borrower the bank has to consider it and if it does not accept it it has to communicate the reasons to the borrower There is no scope for any dispute regarding liability Section and proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without intervention of the court by non adjudicatory process Till application under Section is made there is no adjudication of any kind If possession is given without resistance there is no need of approaching the CMM DM under Section The argument that taking physical possession of secured asset is not contemplated under the NPA Act must be rejected in view of the clear observation of <ORG> in <ORG> case that the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the NPA Act Similarly when the secured creditor approaches <ORG> for assistance to take possession of the secured asset the liability having been crystallized there can be no adjudication about it at that stage There is no question of pointing out to <ORG> at that stage that the person who is to be dispossessed is a tenant or that he has a prior registered sale deed or that in case of simple mortgage ownership rights are not transferred that the mortgagee is only entitled to an obligation to pay and hence possession cannot be taken or that such a course will improve or change the contract etc Grievance that reasons for not accepting the objections were not communicated can also not be raised at that stage because consideration of reply is in the realm of adjudication which cannot be done under Section Besides as per proviso to Section A and explanation to Section non communication of reasons to the borrower does not confer on the borrower or any person right to prefer an application under Section at the stage of communication Remedy is provided in Section where appropriate relief can be given to them In any case it is also held by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra that if the measures undertaken by the secured creditor come in conflict with any other law the provisions of Section override these provisions and that Section gives an overriding effect to the NPA Act We also find no substance in the submission that remedy of appeal application provided under Section of the NPA Act is illusory In this connection we may usefully refer to the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG>supra The argument that it will not be possible to produce any documents there that there objection can be taken only to procedural irregularities about measures taken under Section must also be rejected In this connection we may also refer to the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra In that case <ORG> has after referring to its earlier judgment reiterated that the <ORG> can travel beyond the <ORG> and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice <ORG> has further observed that the <ORG> can pass orders to secure the ends of justice It is also not possible for us to hold that remedy provided under Section is not available to a third party This section begins with the words Any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in Sub section of Section In our opinion the words Any person including borrower cover third parties also Under Section A the secured creditor is required to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his objection to the notice under Section but the reasons so communicated does not confer any right on the borrower to make an application before the <ORG> under Section Explanation to Section states that communication of reasons to the borrower does not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to <ORG> under Section at the stage of communication <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent bank has drawn our attention to the judgments of the <ORG> where rights of third parties are dealt with and relief is granted to them There is also no substance in the submission that no relief can be given to a third party because Section speaks only of restoration of possession of the secured asset to the borrower Section states that if the <ORG> comes to the conclusion that any of the measures stated in Section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the NPA Act and the Rules made thereunder it can restore possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the secured asset to the borrower Section further goes on to say that <ORG> can pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under Sub section of Section Therefore there is no reason to conclude that no orders can be passed in respect of third parties by <ORG> under Section Section which provides for appeal to <ORG> also states that any person aggrieved by any order made by <ORG> under Section may prefer an appeal to an <ORG> There is no provision under the NPA Act putting fetters on the DRTs powers particularly when in <ORG> case supra <ORG> has held that it can travel beyond the <ORG> and it can pass orders to secure ends of justice There is no doubt that a party who is likely to be adversely affected by any action must be given a hearing before the action is taken It proceeds on the basis that liability of the borrower is crystallized In our opinion to secure its object the NPA Act has by necessary implication ruled out giving hearing either to the borrower or third parties till the application is filed under Section As observed by <ORG> in Transcore scase supra Section of the NPA Act inter alia states that the bank or financial institution may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person but they may or may not give notice to the borrower regarding acquisition of financial assets the reason being that assets are transferable overnight Section A requires the secured creditor to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his representation or objection and proviso thereto states that such communication shall not confer right on the borrower to make an application under Section at that stage Section with which we are concerned here does not contemplate any notice to the borrower or a third party It is only Section which states that any person including borrower can make an application to <ORG> being aggrieved by any measure taken under Section Explanation to Section clarifies that reasons communicated to a borrower at the stage of communication will not confer on the person including borrower any right to make an application to <ORG> under Section Section again confers right on any person aggrieved by an order of <ORG> under Section to file an appeal before <ORG> against the said order Nothing prevented the legislature from specifically making a provision in Section for notice to the borrower or third party It purposely did not make provision for notice or hearing being given to the borrower or third party at the stage of Section Though the validity fo the NPA Act is upheld and that cannot be in issue before us we may refer to the observation of <ORG> in <NAME>supra On behalf of the respondents it was urged that the CMM DM acting under Section is performing a ministerial function and hence it is not necessary to give a hearing to the affected parties as he cannot determine the rights of the parties It was also argued that Section gives finality to order passed by the CMM DM under Section and therefore it is necessary to hear parties who are likely to be adversely affected by it We find no substance in this submission Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset For the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of Sub section the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of the District Magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary No act of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority Sub section grants immunity to the CMM DM as regards steps taken by him or force allowed to be used by him for providing assistance for taking possession Since as stated by us adjudication of rival claims is absent at that stage there is no question of his dealing with rival claims and giving a reasoned judgment as regards the merits of the case and obviously there is no question of such a reasoning assuming finality We must also refer to the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> scase supra on which reliance is placed by Mr <NAME> In that case while considering the nature of the power exercised by the Chief Justices of <ORG> or Chief Justice of India under Section of the Arbitration Act <ORG> held that any tribunal conferred with a power to act under a statute has a jurisdiction to satisfy itself whether the conditions for exercise of power existed The Chief Justice or the person designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is arbitration agreement whether the conditions for the exercise of powers have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is appointed whether he is a fit person In fact in <ORG> scase supra <ORG> has clearly stated that while exercising the power under Section of the Arbitration Act the Chief Justice has to consider whether the conditions laid down by the section exist or not In our opinion at the time of passing order under Section of the NPA Act the CMM DM will have to consider only two aspects He must find out whether the secured asset falls within his territorial jurisdiction and whether notice under Section of NPA Act is given or not On the other hand the learned Counsel for the petitioners contended that there are no fetters on the powers of this Court conferred upon it by Articles and of the Constitution of India and though alternative remedy is available if by the time the party avails of it great hardship and injustice is likely to be caused in a given case this Court can pass appropriate orders to redress the grievance of such a party In <ORG> supra <ORG> had allowed the petition filed by the guarantor by holding that as the mortgaged property was situated in Chennai the <ORG> had no territorial jurisdiction and it could not have directed sale of mortgaged property <ORG> clarified that though no provision of the <ORG> Act expressly ousts the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Articles and of the Constitution nevertheless when there is an alternative remedy available judicial prudence demands that the court refrains from exercising its jurisdiction under the constitutional provisions Similarly if <ORG> finds that the action taken by the bank or financial institution on the face of it cannot be sustained because it is hit by Section of the NPA Act <ORG> may entertain a writ petition As done by the Nagpur Bench of this Court in <ORG> supra a writ petition may have to be entertained if reasons for not accepting objections of the borrower to notice under Section are not communicated to the borrower It will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case In this connection we may refer to the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME>supra The bank or financial institution shall before making an application under Section of the NPA Act verify and confirm that notice under Section of the NPA Act is given and that the secured asset falls within the jurisdiction of <ORG> before whom application under Section is made The bank and financial institution shall also consider before approaching <ORG> for an order under Section of the NPA Act whether Section of the NPA Act excludes the application of Sections and thereof to the case on hand CMM DM acting under Section of the NPA Act is not required to give notice either to the borrower or to the rd party He has to only verify from the bank or financial institution whether notice under Section of the NPA Act is given or not and whether the secured assets fall within his jurisdiction There is no adjudication of It is only if the above conditions are not fulfilled that the CMM DM can refuse to pass an order under Section of the NPA Act by recording that the above conditions are not fulfilled If these two conditions are fulfilled he cannot refuse to pass an order under Section Remedy provided under Section of the NPA Act is available to the borrower as well as the third party Remedy provided under Section is an efficacious alternative remedy available to the third party as well as to the borrower where all grievances can be raised Even if a writ petition is entertained as far as possible the parties should be relegated to the remedy provided under Section of the NPA Act before the <ORG> by passing an interim order which will protect the secured assets If the petitioners are so advised they may file an application before the <ORG> within a period of four weeks from today where all questions including the question regarding reply can be raised Petitioner therein is a partnership firm carrying on business at Singapur Building Kalbadevi Road Mumbai Hence respondent issued notice dated and under Section of the NPA Act and thereby called upon the petitioners to pay the sum of Rs Thereafter respondent made an application request under Section of the NPA Act before the <ORG> <ORG> Mumbai requesting for assistance to take possession of the said flat Hence the petitioners have approached this Court for setting aside orders dated and We shall now refer to the facts of Criminal Writ Petition No of Since the petitioners defaulted in repayment of the loan respondent issued notice dated under Section of the NPA Act calling upon the petitioners to pay an amount of Rs Admittedly respondent filed an application under Section of the NPA Act before the <ORG> Esplanade Mumbai for assistance to take possession Being aggrieved by the said order the petitioners have approached this Court In the circumstances of the case and considering that as regards point pertaining to communication of reasons for not accepting the petitioners reply there is a dispute we are of the opinion that the parties must be relegated to the <ORG> where all disputed questions can be agitated On such possession being taken the petitioners shall file an application before the <ORG> if they so desire within four weeks from the date on which the bank takes symbolic possession We make it clear that this order shall not come in the way of settlement talks if any which may be going on between the parties We shall now turn to the facts of Criminal Writ Petition No of Hence respondent issued a notice under Section of the NPA Act calling upon the petitioners to pay a sum of Rs It appears that respondent made an application request to the <ORG> Mumbai under Section of the NPA Act requesting for assistance to take possession of the said flat which is a secured asset The petitioners have challenged the said order in this petition In the circumstances we direct that if the petitioners file any application under Section of the NPA Act to the <ORG> challenging the action taken by respondent the <ORG> shall dispose it off independently and in accordance with law We make it clear that while disposing of the petitions we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of any of the petitions and the interim reliefs are granted or continued in the peculiar circumstances of the individual cases and because the petitions have been pending for a considerable period
