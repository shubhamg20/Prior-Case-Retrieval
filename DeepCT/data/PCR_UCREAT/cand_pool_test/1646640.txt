Act empowers the <ORG> after making such enquiry as it deems fit to fix the maximum price at which the indigenously manufac tured bulk drug shall be sold Clause of Paragraph provides that while so fixing the price of a bulk drug the <ORG> may take into account the average cost of produc tion of such bulk drug manufactured by a efficient manufac turer and allow a reasonable return on net worth The Central <ORG> issued notifications under paragraph of the Order fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs could be sold For the respondents it was contended that unlike other price control legislations the Drugs Prices Control Order was designed to induce better production by providing for a fair return to the manufacturers that the provision for an enquiry proceeding the determination of the price of a bulk drug the prescription in paragraph clause that the average cast of production of the bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer should be taken into account and that a reasonable return on net worth should be allowed and the provision for a review of the order determining the price established that price fixation under the Order was a quasi judicial activity obliging the observance of the rules of natural justice that the review for which provision is made by paragraph was certainly of quasi judicial char acter and therefore it was necessary that the manufactur ers should be informed of the basis for the fixation of the price that the price had been fixed in an arbitrary manner and the <ORG> was not willing to disclose the basis on which the prices were fixed on the pretext that it may involve disclosure of matters of confidential nature that since the price of formulations were dependent on the prices of bulk drugs these should not have been prescribed until the review application was disposed of that the undertaking given by the parties before <ORG> while obtaining ex parte interim order to main tain the stanus quo on the prices of bulk drugs and formula tions prevailing before the issue of notifications and in case of dismissal of their petitions to deposit the differ ence in the prices of the formulations in the <ORG> lapsed with the disposal of the writ petition and it could no longer be enforced and that the delay in filing special leave petitions against other manufacturers should not be condoned as the <ORG> was well versed litigant as compared to private litigants But it has jurisdiction to en quire into the question in appropriate proceedings whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant consid erations kept out of the determination of the price The right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and duty of the <ORG> to provide them are thus transformed into the power of the <ORG> to fix prices and obligation of the producer to charge no more than the price fixed A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or produc er It is intended to operate in future It is conceived in the interest of the general consumer public Price fixation may occasionally assume an adminis trative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from indi viduals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the <ORG> or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be deter mined according to the statutory guidelines laid down by it In such situations the determination of price may acquire a quasi judicial character In the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that Parlia ment may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity A Occasionally the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make such enquiry as it think fit before making the subordinate legislation In such a situa tion while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as fur as it might have been It is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occa sianally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc The reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion under paragraph of the Order to prescribe its own procedure and consider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph in the case of a review against an order made under that paragraph and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders In the instant case the procedure followed by the <ORG> in furnishing the requisite particulars at the time of the hearing of the review applications and discuss ing across the table the various items that hod been taken into account was sufficient compliance with the demands of fair play in the case of the class of persons claiming to by affected by the fixation of maximum price under the Drugs Prices Control Order It cannot therefore be said that there was anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the <ORG> The ques tions that obsolete quantitative usages had been taken into consideration proximate cost data had been ignored and the data relating to the year ending November had been adopted as the basis that there were errors in totalling errors in the calculation of prices of utilities errors in the calculation of net worth and many other similar er rors were questions to be raised before the <ORG> in the review application under paragraph Where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to maintain or increase their supply or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices the court should not make any interim order staying the implementation of the notification fixing the prices There was no doubt in anyone mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to the Supreme <ORG> whichever way the writ petitions were decided The undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were thus intended to and do continue to subsist The Government however fixed the price at Rs per Kg It is in pursuance of the powers granted to <ORG> by the Essential Commodi ties Act that first the Drugs Prices Control Order and later the Drugs Prices Control Order were made <ORG> has preferred these appeals by Special leave of this Court against the judgment of <ORG> Before we turn to the terms of the Drugs Prices Con trol Order we would like to make certain general observations and explain the legal position in regard to them The assem bling of the raw materials and the mechanics of price fixa tion are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them The <ORG> will of course examine if there is any hostile discrimination In the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that <ORG> may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say for example levying a municipal rate in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation The right here given to rate payers or others is in the nature of a concession which is not to detract from the character of the activity as legislative and not quasijudi cial But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity Occasionally the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make such enquiry as it thinks fit before making the subordinate legislation In such a situa tion while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as full as it might have been It is true that with the proliferation of delegated legislation there is a tendency for the line between legis lation and administration to vanish into an illusion Admin istrative quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legis lative activity and conversely legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activity It has also been said Rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class while an adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situa tions A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer It is intended to operate in the future It is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public The right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the <ORG> to so provide them are transformed into the power of the <ORG> to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge more than the price fixed Price fixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the <ORG> or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined accord ing to the statutory guidelines laid down by it In such situations the determination of price may acquire aquasi judicial character We also wish to clear a misapprehension which appears to prevail in certain circles that price fixation affects the manufacturer or producer primarily and therefore fairness requires that he be given an opportunity and that fair opportunity to the manufacturer or producer must be read into the procedure for price fixa tion We do not agree with the basic premise that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers It is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer if not more It was to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those were engaged in the industry trade or commerce alleged that they were incurring loss would not render the law stipulating the price unreasonable He may have to bear loss in the same way as he does when he suf fers losses on account of economic forces operating in the business If an essential commodity is in short supply or there is hoarding concerning or there is unusual demand there is abnormal increase in price There is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to hoarding or cornering or artificial short supply The cases of <ORG> and <ORG> were distinguished on the ground that they were governed by sub section of sec The case of <ORG> was distinguished on the ground that the deci sion was rendered by invitation and on the agreement of the parties irrespective of technical and legal questions It could not there fore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price Reasonableness for purposes of judging whether there was an excess of power or an arbitrary exercise of it is really the demonstration of a rea sonable nexus between the matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of exercise of that power in <ORG> that it was enough compliance with the Constitutional man date if the basis adopted for price fixation was not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the power to fix the price He observed In the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the Executive and unless it is patent that there is hostiled discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid who delivered a separate opinion for himself and for <NAME> agreed that the judgment in <ORG> was not to provide a precedent in price fixation case He indicated the indicia which led him to the conclusion that price fixation was a legislative measure He observed We think that unless by the terms of a particular statute or order price fixation is made a quasi judicial function for speci fied purposes or cases it is really legisla tive in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation It is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class The former had said There is no doubt that a minister or any other body in making legislation for example by statutory instrument or by law is not subject to the rules of natural justice <NAME> Lord <NAME>m of St The latter had said There is no right to be heard before the making of legislation whether primary or dele gated unless it is provided by statutes It provides that in calculating the amount to be paid for the commodity required to be sold regard is to be had to a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by <ORG> under this section the manufac turing cost of sugar the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar It is further prescribed that different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar He said If a particular function is termed legisla tive or rulemaking rather than judicial or adjudication it may have substantial effects upon the parties concerned If the function is treated as legislative in nature there is no right to notice and hearing unless a statute expressly requires them XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX As a federal court has recently pointed out there is no bright line between rule making and adjudication The most famous pre APA attempt to explain the difference between legislative and judicial functions was made by Justice <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> A judicial inquiry said he investigates declares and enforces liabili ties as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power According to Chief Justice <NAME> Rulemaking is nor mally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class An adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situations Bulk drugs were divided into essential bulk drugs which were included in the schedule and bulk drugs which were not so included It was said The concern about drug prices therefore really arises from the fact that many of them are essential to the health and welfare of the community and that there is no justification for the drug industry charging prices and having a production pattern which is based not upon the needs of the community but on aggres sive marketing tactices and created demand Yet another variant of a selectivity according to <ORG> would be to identify product groups which individually are important and which collec tively constitute the bulk of the output of the industry Paragraph of the Order enables the <ORG> with a view to regulating the equitable distribution of any indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or the second schedule and making it available at a fair price and after making such enquiry as it deems fit to fix from time to time by notification in the official gazette the maximum price at which the bulk drug shall be sold Clause of Paragraph provides that while so fixing the price of a bulk drug the <ORG> may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufac tured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on net worth Paragraph provides that where the price of a bulk drug has not been notified by the <ORG> the manufac turer shall within days of the commencement of the the production of such bulk drug make an application to the <ORG> in Form I and intimate the <ORG> the price at which he intends to sell the bulk drug and the <ORG> may after making such an enquiry as it thinks fit by order fix a provisional price at which such bulk drug shall be sold Paragraph of the order provides that notwith standing anything contained in paragraph the <ORG> may if it considers necessary or expedient so to do for increasing the production of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or second schedule by order fix a a retention price of such bulk drug a common sale price for such bulk drug taking into account the weighted average of the retention price fixed under clause a It is meant to provide a fillip to individual manufacturers of bulk drugs whose production it is necessary to increase Paragraph deals with the power of the <ORG> to fix retention price and pooled price for the sale of bulk drugs specified in the First and Second Schedules which are both indigenously manufactured and imported It is provided that the amount credited to the Drugs Prices Equaliza tion Account shall be spent for paying to the manufacturer the shortfall between his retention price and the common selling price or as the case may be the pooled price Form No which is referred to in paragraphs and is titled Form of application for fixation or revision of prices of bulk drug Great emphasis was laid on the second clause of paragraph of the Order which provides that in fixing the price of a bulk drug the Gov ernment may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on networth It was submitted that the provision for an enquiry preceding the determina tion of the price of a bulk drug the prescription in para graph clause that the average cost of production of the drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer should be taken into account and that a reasonable return on networth should be allowed and the provision for a review of the order determining the price established that price fixation under the Drugs Prices Control Order was a quasi judicial activity obliging the observance of the rules of natural justice The provision for enquiry in the first clause of paragraph and the prescrip tion of the matters to be taken into account in the second clause of paragraph further strengthened the implication according to the learned counsel It was contended that in any case whatever be the nature of the enquiry and the order contemplated by paragraph the review for which provision made by paragraph was certainly of a quasi judicial character and therefore it was necessary that the manufacturers should be informed of the basis for the fixa tion of the price and furnished with details of the same in order that they may truly and effectively avail themselves of the remedy of review It was suggested that the delay in disposing of the review applications had the effect of rendering the original notifications fixing the prices unreal and out of date and liable to be struck down on that ground alone Such enquiry as it thinks fit is an enquiry in which information is sought from whatever source considered necessary by the enquiring body and is different from an enquiry in which an opportunity is required to be given to persons likely to be affected It is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occasionally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc The reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion to prescribe its own procedure and con sider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph in the case of a review against an order under paragraph and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders In the context of the Drug industry with which we are concerned and in regard to which the Control Order is made we must proceed on the basis that the manufacturers of bulk drugs are generally persons who know all that is to be known about the price fixed by the <ORG> For example the manufacturer may require the Gov ernment to give information regarding the particulars de tailed in Form No of the Fourth Schedule which have been taken into account and those which have been excluded The manufacturer may also require to be informed the elements which were taken into account and those which were excluded in assessing the free reserves entering into the calcula tion of net worth The decision rendered without disclosing the report of <ORG> and without affording reasonable opportuni ty to the appellants to present their case was contrary to natural justice was therefore void supra it was decided by the court that the power of review granted to <ORG> under Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules required the authority to act judicially and its decision would be a quasi judicial act and the fact that Rule gave power to <ORG> to pass such order as it may deem just and proper did not negative the duty to act judicial ly In <ORG> it was observed that in cases where owing to the compulsion of the fact situation or the necessity of taking speedy action no pre decisional hearing is given but the action is followed soon by a full post decisional hear ing to the person affected there is in reality no exclusion of the audi alteram partem rule As we said these cases have no application to a review of subordinate legislation by the subordinate legislating body at the instance of a party There is no question before us that paragraph prescribes any arbitrary guideline We do not propose to delve into the question whether there has been any such arbitrary assumption of facts and figures The affidavits filed on behalf of <ORG> show that the procedure which is adopted in hearing the review applications is to discuss across the table the various items that have been taken into account We do not consider that there is anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the <ORG> Indeed we find that the hearing given to the manufacturers is often protected It was submitted that there were errors in totalling errors in the calculation of prices of utilities errors in the calcula tion of net worth and many other similar errors As we pointed out earlier these are all matters which should legitimately be raised in the review application if there is any substance in them We think that the question has to be decided with reference to the defini tion of free reserve in paragraph of the Control Order and not on any assumed principle of accountancy His submission was that where bonus in excess of statutory minimum was payable under the provisions of the Bonus Act there was no option left to the manufacturer not to pay the excess bonus Similarly where expenses have been legitimately incurred and allowed by Income tax authorities there was no justification for excluding those items of expenditure from the cost We do not agree with the submission He submitted that the price of a formulation was dependant on the price of the bulk drug and it was therefore not right to fix the price of formulation when the price of bulk drug was in question in the review application and there was a prospect of the price of the bulk drug being increased If a review application is allowed and the price of the bulk drug is raised and if in the meanwhile the formulation had been ordered to be sold at a low price it may result in consid erable loss to the manufacturer Another submission of <NAME> was that there was considerable delay in the disposal of the review applica tions by the Govern ment and that even now no orders had been passed in several cases We think that in matter of this nature where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to main tain or increase supply of the commodities or for securing the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of the commodity it is not right that the court should make any interim order staying the implementation of the notifi cation fixing the prices Thereafter on November a further order was made to the following effect After hearing learned counsel and with their consent and arrangement has been worked out as on interim measure The terms of the said order that is on the undertaking given on behalf of the petitioners to maintain status quo on the prices prevail ing prior to the issue of the impugned notifi cation the petitioners through their counsel further given an undertaking to this court that in case the petition is dismissed and the rule is discharged the petitioners shall within eight weeks of the dismissal of the petition by this court deposit in this court the difference in the prices of the formula tions in question for being equaliza tion account It is made clear that the under taking is without prejudice to the petition ers right to take appropriate directions from <ORG> if so advised in this re gard It was argued by the learned counsel that the undertaking given by the parties lapsed with the disposal of the writ petition by <ORG> and that it could no longer be enforced We do not agree with this submission We do not think that there was any doubt in anyone mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to <ORG> whichever way the writ petitions were decided We are of the view that the undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were intended to and do continue to subsist On the conclusions arrived at by us we have no doubt that the appeal must be allowed and the writ petition in <ORG> dismissed However we think that it is necessary to give a direction to the Government to dispose of the review applications after giving a notice of hearing to the manufacturer Any information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment It is con tended that the <ORG> is a well verse litigant as compared with private litigants and even if there is justi fication of adopting a liberal approach in condoning delay in the case of private litigants there was no need to adopt such approach in the case of the <ORG> In cases like the present where parties have acted on the assumption that no appeals had been filed against them and have proceeded to arrange their affairs accordingly it would be unjust to condone the delay in filing the appeals at the instance of the <ORG> Though we see considerable force in the submission of <NAME> we think that the circumstances of the instant cases do justify the exercise of our discretion to condone the delay
