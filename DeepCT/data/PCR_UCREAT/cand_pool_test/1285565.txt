These appeals by special leave arise from the judgment and decree of <ORG> made on April in A No of Consequentially he filed the suit for perpetual injunction against the appellant It is contended by Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents that in a mere suit for injunction though incidentally founded on title the courts are require to record a finding whether the respondents were in possession of the land as on the date of the suit and if finding of being in possession is recorded then they are entitled to perpetual injunction against everyone except the true owner In this cases all the three courts concurrently found as a fact that the respondents were in possession of the land as on the date of the suit The question is whether the premise on which the learned counsel has projected the case is based on legally acceptable legal premise It is true that when <ORG> has as a pure appreciation of evidence considered and recorded as a fact a finding on possession normally this Court would accept such finding and proceed on that premise to decide substantial question of law of public importance exercising the power under Article As rightly contended by Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for some of the respondents conclusiveness of the public purpose stands established It is seen from the evidence that the <ORG> found one <NAME> and <NAME> had interest in the land bearing Survey No of an extent of one acre and thirty two cents As a corollary possession would be taken and thereafter the land stands vested in the <ORG> under Section free from all encumbrances It is seen that acres of land acquired by a common notification was taken and the award came to be made and possession was taken of all the lands Question arises whether it would be possible for the <ORG> to take physical possession of the entire acres of land and deliver the same to <ORG> The approach to the question must be pragmatic and realistic but not purely legalistic It is true that in <NAME> case <ORG> had held at page thus The question is what is the mode of taking possession The Act is silent on the point Unless possession is taken Concerned the mode of taking the possession obviously would be for the authority to go upon the land and to do some act which would indicate that the authority has taken possession of the land It may be in the form of a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise or by hanging a written declaration on the spot that the authority has taken possession of the land <NAME> <NAME> as he then was speaking for two members had held that There can be no question of taking symbolical possession in the sense understood by judicial decisions under the Code of Civil Procedure What the Act contemplates as a necessary condition of vesting of the land in the <ORG> is the taking of actual possession of the land There can be no hard and fast rule laying down what act would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land But here in our opinion since the land was laying fallow and there was no crop on it at the material time the act of the Tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land for the purpose of determining what part was waster and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and determining its extent was sufficient to constitute taking of possession It is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or the occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time though it may be desirable where possible to give such notice before possession is taken by the authorities as that would eliminate the possibility of any fraudulent or collusive transaction of taking mere paper possession without the occupant or the owner every coming to know of it It is settled law by series of judgments of this Court that one of the accepted modes of taking possession of the acquired land is recording of a memorandum or Panchnama by the <ORG> in the presence of witnesses winged by him them and that would constitute taking possession of the land as it would be impossible to take physical possession of the acquired land It is seen that when the land was acquired for planned development of the city and a large chunk of buildings has already been built up and the land admeasuring about acre cents has been set apart for park purpose obviously along with other lands the disputed land was taken possession and construction was made as per plans Would it be possible for the appellant without delivery of possession to <ORG> to construct such massive constructions and leave out only this part of the land bearing survey No which was set a part for public purpose namely public amenity of part The making of the plan would emerge only after the land is taken possession and demarcation thereof is made and constructions are carried out At this stage notice was given to the respondents and the respondents filed the suit for perpetual injunction Accordingly the decrees and judgments of the first appellate Court and <ORG> stand set aside and that of the trial Judge stands restored
