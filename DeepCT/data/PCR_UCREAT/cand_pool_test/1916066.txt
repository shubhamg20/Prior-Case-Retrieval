It appears that the first two defendants borrowed a sum of money from the plaintiff on a promissory note executed on the th January They transferred their properties to the third defendant on the st January and on that very date the third defendant executed an agreement in favour of his vendors expressly undertaking to pay to the plaintiff his dues out of the consideration money retained in his hands The plaintiff instituted this suit on the th January against his debtors as also the third defendant On behalf of the third defendant it is urged in this Court that there was an interpolation in the deed of agreement executed by him and that in fact the recital as to the debt due to the plaintiff from the first two defendants was inserted This defence has not bean bilieved by the Court below and upon the findings of the <ORG> Judge it is impossible for us to examine this question of fact We most consequently proceed on the assumption that the third defendant did undertake to pay the plaintiff his dues out of the consideration money in his hands The question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to enforce the agreement made between the third defendant and his vendors at The third defendant however seeks to distinguish that case on the ground that there the arrangement between the debtor transferor and the transferee was communicated to the creditor whereas there is nothing to show that in the present case the arrangement between the first two defendants and the third defendant was ever brought to the notice of the plaintiffs by either of them In that case there was a contention that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed on the ground of novation of contract and from this point of view stress was laid upon the fact that the arrangement between the transferor and transferee bad been communicated to the creditor Bat he proceeded to hold that although no party to the contract had an equitable right through the mediation the agreement to <OR<ORG>> as shown by a decision of Lord <NAME> to the same effect There had been no communication of the agreement bat wean <OR<ORG>> and <OR<ORG>> to <OR<OR<ORG>>> and no sum communication was necessary because the claim was not based on novation of contract on the allegation that by mutual arrangement of all the parties a new agreement as between IV and had been substituted in supersession of the original agreement between <OR<ORG>> and <OR<OR<ORG>>> The decision was based on the ground that <OR<ORG>> was in essence a trustee of the money in his hands for the benefit of <OR<OR<ORG>>> who could clearly enforce it whether or not the arrangement had been communicated to him by <OR<ORG>> or <OR<ORG>>
