The only question which was pressed in this second appeal relates to the validity of the notice The notice under Section of the Transfer of Property Act was sent to both the tenants under one registered cover the names of both the tenants being mentioned as addressees over the same The registered cover was tendered by the postman to only one of them but he refused to accept service me first contention on behalf of the appellants was that The notice was never tendered to the other tenant and there was therefore no service of the notice under Section of the Transfer of Property Act on him It was held by <NAME> in that case that where in case of a joint lease a notice is addressed to all the joint lessees but is served only on one of them there is sufficient compliance with the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and I agree with respect with that view Where a closed envelope is tendered to a person and he refuses to accept delivery of the same he of course has no knowledge of the contents of that envelope but when he does not care to accept delivery of the envelope the law should impute Knowledge of the contents thereof to him and It is on that basis that refusal to accept delivery of a registered or unregistered notice is regarded as sufficient notice of the contents of the envelope to the addressee That should not however make a material difference Even if a notice is sent to a particular person on a postcard the postman is not opted to let the addressee read the contents thereof before he refuses to accept service of the same and if the addressee can be imputed with constructive knowledge of the contents of that notice if he refuses service of the postcard without reading its contents there is no reason why similar knowledge may not be imputed to him even when the notice is contained in a closed envelope
