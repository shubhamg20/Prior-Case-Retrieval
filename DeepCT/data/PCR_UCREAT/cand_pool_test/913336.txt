granting power to inspect Whether includes power of search sub section giving power to officer confiscating to give dealer an option to pay tax Plus an additional amount before stage of first sale when tax ordinarily becomes due Whether repugnant to scheme of Act and invalid Sub sec The respondents challenged the department action by writ petitions filed in <ORG> under Art It was contended by the petitioners that on a proper construction of section of the Madras General Sales Tax Act No of the officers of the <ORG> had no authority to search the premises and seize any account books or goods found there that if section authorised seizure and confiscation of goods it was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> for it was not covered by item of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution relating to taxes on the sale or purchase of goods and that if various provisions in were capable of being construed as authorising search and seizure they were violative of Art Clause a of the second proviso to sub section gives power to the officer ordering confiscation to give the person affected an option to pay in lieu of confiscation in cases where the goods are taxable under the Act the tax recoverable and an additional amount and thus provides for recovery of tax even before the first sale in the State which is the point of time in a large majority of cases for recovery of tax <ORG> was therefore wrong in holding that there was no power of search whatsoever under sub section Similarly it is clear from sub section which gives power to seize accounts etc These are sufficient safeguards and the restriction if any on the right to hold property and the right to carry on trade by sub section must therefore be held to be a reasonable restriction While the court held that the <ORG> has power to provide for search and seizure in connection with taxation law in order that evasion may be checked it did not decide the general question whether a power to confiscate goods which are found on search and which are not entered in account books of the dealer is an ancillary power necessary for the purpose of stopping evasion of tax The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These five appeals on certificates granted by <ORG> raise common questions of law and will be dealt with to ether of arising out of writ petition No of in order to understand the questions that fall to be decided in the present appeals of hereinafter referred to as the Act the officers of the <ORG> had no authority to search the premises and seize either the account books or the goods found therein Secondly it was contended that if section authorised seizure and confiscation of goods it was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> for it could not be covered by item of list II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution relating to taxes on the sale or purchase of goods All the petitions were opposed on behalf of <ORG> and its case was firstly <ORG> took the view that the power of seizure and confiscation of goods contained in sub section could not be said to be ancillary and incidental to the power to tax sale or purchase of goods and therefore this provision was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> <ORG> further found that was not complied with strictly before confiscation was ordered and no pro per opportunity was given to the dealer to show that the goods seized and confiscated were not accounted for in his accounts The same three questions which were raised before <ORG> have been raised before us on behalf of the appellant Before however we deal with them we would briefly refer to the provisions of the Act which are material for our purposes The Act provides for registration of firms and of dealers for appointment of officers for collection of tax for the levy of penalty and for appeals and revisions It also casts a duty on dealers to maintain a true and correct account It is in these terms Any officer empowered by the Government in this behalf may for the purpose of this Act the goods in his possession and his offices shops godowns vessels or vehicles shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by such officer Provided that no residential accommodation not being a place of business cum residence shall be entered into and searched by such officer except on the authority of a search warrant issued by a Magistrate having jurisdiction over the area and all searches under this sub section shall so far as may be be made in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure If any such officer has reason to suspect that any dealer is attempting to evade the payment of any tax fee or other amount due from him under this Act he may for reasons to be recorded in writing seize such accounts Any such officer shall have power to seize and confiscate any goods which are found in any office Provided that before ordering the confiscation of goods under this Sub section the officer shall give the person affected an opportunity of being heard and make an inquiry in the prescribed manner Provided further that the officer ordering the confiscation shall give the person affected option to pay in lieu of confiscation a in cases where the goods are taxable under this Act in addition to the tax recoverable a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees or double the amount of tax recoverable whichever is greater and in other cases a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees It will be seen from the above brief review of the provisions of the Act that it mainly deals with sales tax to be levied at the point of first sale in the State though there is also provision for purchase tax in certain cases So far as sub is concerned there is no difficulty It empowers any officer empowered by the <ORG> in this behalf to require any dealer to produce before him the accounts registers records and other documents and to furnish any other information relating to his business However there is no dispute with respect to that sub section as the power has to he exercised for the purpose of the Act i with reference to assessment proceedings at all stages including recovery of tax and prosecution for offences There is no doubt that there are no specific words in sub giving power of search But where as in this case the power has been given to inspect not merely accounts registers records and other documents maintained by a dealer but also to inspect his offices shops godowns vessels or vehicles it follows that the empowered officer would have the right to enter the offices etc Naturally his inspection will be for purposes of the Act i for the purpose of seeing that there is no evasion of tax Reading therefore these two provisions together it is clear that the empowered officer has the right to enter the offices etc he has also the power to inspect them These two powers taken together in our opinion mean that the em powered officer has the power to search the office etc We cannot therefore agree with <ORG> that there is no power of search whatsoever in sub because the subsection in terms does not provide for search He has also the power to enter the dealer offices etc We have therefore no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the power of search is implicit in sub with reference accounts etc It is urged on behalf of the appellant that as the officer is entitled to inspect all accounts etc The proviso lays down that i no purely residential accommodation shall be entered into and searched by such officer except on the authority of a search warrant issued by a Magistrate having jurisdiction over the area and ii that all searches under this sub section shall so far as may be be made in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure But it is urged that a proviso carves out something which is already contained in the main provision and the main provision at any rate does not provide for search of a purely residential accommodation As we have already held there is no provision in the main part of the sub section for searching purely residential premises We have already come to that conclusion independent of the proviso We may in this connection refer to the following passage in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes Eleventh Edition at where it is observed There is no rule that the first or enacting part is to be construed without reference to the proviso The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest The true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail If he has such reason he may for reasons to be recorded in writing seize such accounts etc the appellant justifies the power to seize and confiscate goods on the round that it is ancillary and incidental to the power to tax for it is necessary to have such power in order to check evasion of tax and make it unprofitable <ORG> held that the Act was not a law on goods and that a provision for confiscation of goods found on search was neither incidental nor ancillary to the power to tax contained in item It is under this power to check evasion that provision for search and seizure is made in many taxing statutes It must therefore be held that the legislature has power to provide for search and seizure in connection with taxation laws in order that evasion may be checked It is further urged on behalf of the appellant that confiscation of goods which are not entered in accounts is merely a provision of ancillary nature to check evasion of tax by making it unprofitable for dealers to secrete goods in which they are dealing We do not propose in the present case to decide the general question whether a power to confiscate goods which are found on search and which are not entered in account books of the dealer is an ancillary power necessary for the purpose of stopping evasion of tax It may be added that there is no such provision as the second proviso in of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act We do not therefore propose to express any opinion as to the correctness of the above decision of <ORG> in addition to the tax recoverable a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees or double the amount of tax recoverable and ii to pay a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees or double the amount of tax recoverable But under cl a of the second proviso the tax is ordered to be recovered even before the sale in addition to the penalty not exceeding Rs We are therefore of opinion that cl a of the second proviso being repugnant to the entire scheme of the Act in so far as it provides for recovery of tax even before the first sale in the <ORG> which is the point of time in a large majority of cases for recovery of tax must fall on the ground of repugnancy We therefore agree with <ORG> and strike down sub but for reasons different from those which commended themselves to <ORG> Then we come to the question whether sub ss and of of the Act which have been struck down by <ORG> on the ground that they are unreasonable restrictions on the right to hold property and to carry on trade have been correctly struck down The main reason which impelled <ORG> to strike down sub was that there was no safeguard provided for search made thereunder It also held that <ORG> was given the power to empower any officer to make a search under sub and this meant that even an officer of low status could be empowered Consequently <ORG> struck down sub on the ground that it gave arbitrary power of search which could be made even by an officer of low status It is true that search under this sub section can be made by any officer empowered by Government in this behalf but we have no reason to think that Government will not empower officers of proper status to make searches We cannot also forget that in a case of this kind the Government cannot find sufficient number of officers of what may be called high status to make searches for dealers who may be covered by the Act may be legion throughout the State and if such searches could only be made by high officers there would not be enough officers available to do so We are also of opinion that though sub itself provides no safeguards and might have been open to objection on that ground there is a provision in the proviso to sub which lays down that all searches under this subsection shall so far as may be Some of these provisions are contained in Chapter VII but one such provision is contained in It is true that that section specifically refers to an officer in charge of a police station or a police officer making an investigation But when the proviso applies the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure to all searches made under this sub section as far as may be possible we see no reason why should not apply mutatis mutandis to searches made under sub After he has done these things he can make the search In view of these safeguards and other safeguards provided in Chapter VII of the Code apply so far as may be to searsee no reason to hold that the restriction if any on the right to hold property and to carry on trade by the search provided in sub is not a reasonable restriction keeping in view the object of the search namely prevention of evasion of tax if he has reason to suspect that any dealer is attempting to evade the payment of any tax etc It also provides that he has to record his reasons in writing and we are of opinion that these reasons have to be recorded before the accounts are seize These in our opinion are sufficient safeguards and the restrictions iS any on the right to hold property and the right to carry on trade by sub must therefore be held to be a reasonable restriction We may add that the proviso to sub has fixed the period for which the officer seizing accounts can keep them namely days at a time and if he wants to keep them for has to take the permission of the next additional safeguard entitling the dealer accounts after every days unless a higher officer has permitted the retention of accounts for a period longer than days and of of the Act are unreasonable restrictions on the right to hold property or carry on trade for reasons indicated We now proceed to consider what order should be passed in the appeals in the view we have taken about the interpretation and validity of sub ss and are unconstitutional on the ground of their being unreasonable restrictons on the right to hold property and to carry on trade In view of our decision on the main question of law we order parties to bear their own costs in all the appeals
