The respondents filed petitions under Art of the Constitution for the issue of writ of mandamus directing the refund of sales tax collected from them a of the Constitution and they paid the tax under a mistake of law and the tax so paid was refundable under of the Indian Contract Act The appellant contended that there was no violation of Art of the Constitution even if there was such violation the tax came within the special provision under Art no power to direct refund of tax already paid and in any event the <ORG> should not exercise its discretionary power of issuing a writ of mandamus directing this to be done since there was unreasonable delay in filing the petition Held i Even though the liability to pay tax was created by the sale of tobacco in Madhya Pradesh and not by the import itself the facts and circumstances showed that trade and commerce as between Madhya Bharat and other parts of India was directly impeded by the impugned tax and therefore the said tax violated Art The <ORG>s have power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to grant consequential reliefs by ordering repayment of money realised by the Government without the authority of law Even if there is not such delay in cases where the opposite party raises a prima facie issue as regards the availability of such relief on the merits on grounds like limitation the <ORG> should ordinarily refuse to issue the writ of mandamus the maximum period fixed by the legislature as the time within which relief by a suit in a Civil <ORG> must be claimed may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Art The <ORG> may consider the delay unreasonable even if it is less than the period of limitation prescribed for a civil action for the remedy The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeals by the State of Madhya Pradesh are against the orders made by <ORG> in applications under Art All these petitioners carried on business in Madhya Bharat which later became part of the State of Madhya Pradesh They were assessed to sales tax on their sales of tobacco in accordance with the notification issued by the State Government in exercise of powers under of the State Sales Tax Act and large amounts were collected by <ORG> and later by <ORG> The liability to pay tax arose under of the Madhva Bharat Sales Tax Act This Act came into force from the st day of May As originally enacted it provided that a every dealer who imports goods into Madhya Bharat shall be liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected from the st day of May if his total turnover in the previous year in respect of sales or supplies of goods exceeded Rs similarly every manufacturer or processor whose turnover in the previous year exceeded Rs was made liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected from the st day of May every other dealer was made liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected from the st day of May if the total turnover in the previous year exceeded Rs There was also an amendment in making it clear that the taxable turnover on which the tax liability The legal position therefore is that unless there is a valid notification under no tax can be levied This provided that with effect from the st day of May sales tax shall be collected in respect of goods specified in column of the Schedule that was attached to the notification at the point of sale mentioned in column at the rates mentioned in column This was followed by another notification dated May under which a lower rate was prescribed for tobacco used for Bidi manufacturers This last notification was again superseded by a notification dated the st January in consequence of which the old position was restored with effect from January If the tax could have been claimed to be regula tory or compensatory it would have got the benefit of the latter decision There is however no scope for such a claim See Firm Mehtab Majid Co The tax could still be good if even though it contravened the provisions of Art it came within the saving provi sions of Art the legislature of a State may by law impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced An attempt was made on behalf of the State before <ORG> and also before us to construe the notification mentioned above to mean that not only the tobacco imported from other States but also similar goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat were subject to this tax and at the same rate It was argued that a dealer in these goods who was an importer and so sold goods imported by him into Madhya Bharat would also be selling goods not so imported but manufactured and produced in the State The learned Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh who appeared before us in support of these appeals suggested that that was done by <ORG> on a mistaken interpretation of the law If the intention had been as suggested by the learned Advocate General that though the tax is payable at the point of sale by an importer the scale by the same person of goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat would also be liable to tax the word importer would not have been used in column but the word dealer would have been used and the point of sale would have been indicated by some other words as the first sale in Madhya Bharat or the sale to the retailer in Madhya Bharat as the rule making authority chose Reading this we find that the point of sale in Madhya Bharat at which the tax is payable is the sale by the dealer who brings or causes to be brought into Madhya Bharat any goods from outside for the purpose of processing manufacturing or sale or who purchases goods in Madhya Bharat for the purpose of sale from a dealer who does not ordinarily carry on business in Madhya Bharat When only such a sale is being made the point at which the tax is payable there is hardly any scope for a serious argument that the notification was intended to make sales by that same dealer of goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat liable to tax it may not be out of place to notice in this connection the distinction made by of the Madhya Bharat Sales Tax Act between sales by a dealer who imports goods cl There can therefore be no escape from the conclusion that similar goods manufactured or produced in the State of Madhya Bharat have not been subjected to the tax which tobacco leaves manufactured tobacco and tobacco used for Bidi manufacturing imported from other States have to pay on sale by the importer As already pointed out it contravenes the provisions of Art It cannot now be disputed that this payment was made under a mistake within of the Indian Contract Act and so the Government to whom the payment has been made by mistake must in law repay it The question is whether the relief of repayment has to be sought by the tax payer by an action in a civil court or whether such an order can be made by <ORG> in exercise of its jurisdiction under Art This Article empowers <ORG> to give relief by way of enforcement of fundamental rights and other rights by issuing directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari According to the petitioners a writ in the nature of mandamus can be appropriately used where money has been paid to the Government by mistake to give relief by commanding repayment of the same an order for refund of tax illegally collected from the petitioner under Rule of the Madras General Sales Tax Turnover and Assessment Rules The order made in this case by <ORG> for refund was affirmed by this <ORG> in appeal We see no reason to think that <ORG> have not got this power If a right has been infringed whether a fundamental right or a statutory right and the aggrieved party comes to the court for enforcement of the right it will not be giving complete relief if the court merely de clares the existence of such right or the fact that that existing right has been infringed It will hardly be reasonable to say that while the court will grant relief by such command in the nature of an order of injunction where the invasion of a right has been merely threatened the court must still refuse where the right has been actually invaded to give the consequential relief and content itself with merely a declaration that the right exists and has been invaded or with merely quashing the illegal order made For the reasons given above we are clearly of opinion that <ORG> have power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to give consequential relief by ordering repayment of money realised by the <ORG> without the authority of law At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact that the special remedy provided in Art It has been made clear more than once that the power to give relief under Art This is specially true in the case of power to issue writs in the nature of mandamus Among the several matters which <ORG> rightly take into consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the delay made by the aggrieved party in seeking this special remedy and what excuse there is for it Another is the nature of controversy of facts and law that may have to be decided as regards the availability of consequential relief Thus where as in these cases a person comes to the <ORG> for relief under Art on the allegation that he has been assessed to tax under a void legislation and having paid it under a mistake is entitled to get it back the court if it finds that the assessment was void being made under a void provision of law and the payment was made by mistake is still not bound to exercise its discretion directing repayment Whether repayment should be ordered in the exercise of this discretion will depend in each case on its own facts and circumstances It may however be stated as a general rule that if there has been unreasonable delay the court ought not ordinarily to lend its aid to a party by this extraordinary remedy of mandamus Again where even if there is no such delay the <ORG> or the statutory authority against whom the consequential relief is prayed for raises a prima facie triable issue as regards the availability of such relief on the merits on grounds like limitation the <ORG> should ordinarily refuse to issue the writ of mandamus for such payment The order of refund made by the High <ORG> in these cases cannot therefore be dis turbed The position in Civil Appeal Nos to of is however different We accordingly allow this petition and issue a writ directing the oppo nents to refund to the applicant firm the amount of tax collected from it during the above mentioned period He argued that assuming that the remedy of recovery by action in a civil court stood barred on the date these applications were made that would be no reason to refuse relief under Art It appears to us however that the maximum period fixed by the legislature as the time within which the relief by a suit in a civil court must be brought may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Art The Court may consider the delay unreasonable even if it is less than the period of limitation prescribed for a civil action for the remedy If the mistake was known in these cases on or shortly after January the delay in making these applications should be considered unreasonable In either view of the matter we are of opinion the orders for refund made by <ORG> in these seven cases cannot be sustained We see no reason to interfere with the order for refund made by <ORG> in this case In the result Civil Appeals Nos to of are allowed in part and the orders for refund made in those cases are set aside In the other appeals which are dismissed <ORG> will pay costs to the respondents
