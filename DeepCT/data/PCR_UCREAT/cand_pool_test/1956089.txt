The question referred by <ORG> is i Whether a reference to <ORG> is competent on the point indicated in the question following which was not raised before or considered by the <ORG> It arises in the following circumstances and that she took a loan of Rs it was urged that this was the belongings of the wife and it was also submitted that the first transaction of the business having taken place in August no profits could have arisen as early as the th of July With regard to other items Nos and the <ORG> upheld the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and gave reasons why the explanation given by the assessee could not be accepted Notice was served on the assessee on the th of August and he made an application under section of the Indian Income tax Act We take it that it must have been filed within the sixty days allowed by section of the Income tax Act The assessee sought to raise six questions of law and I law and I need only refer to the first question which was On the other hand as indicated by the dates the same fall within the year preceding assessment year <ORG> by an order dated the th February have drawn up a statement of the case and have referred the following two questions for decision of the <ORG> Whether a reference to <ORG> is competent on the point indicated in the question following which was not raised before or considered the Tribunal If the answer to above question is in the affirmative whether cash credits the nature and source of which were not satisfactorily explained and which came to the surface in the financial year were properly assessed as the assessees income from undisclosed sources for the assessment for It is necessary to say that in the sixth paragraph of the statement the following was added The Commissioner wishes us to add that the questions above set out were not raised in the assessees application under section either It is under these circumstances that two questions of law were referred for decision by this <ORG> and the first one has been referred for the opinion of <ORG> In order to decide the question that has been referred that is whether a reference to <ORG> is competent on a question which was not raised before or considered by the <ORG> it is necessary to refer to the scheme of the Act Section Provides for appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against an assessment under the Act It runs Any assessee objecting to the amount or denying his liability to be assessed may appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against the assessment This appeal has to be presented within thirty days of the receipt of notice of demand and has to be in the prescribed form which is to be verified in the prescribed manner and the form is prescribed under rule made under section of the Income tax Act At the hearing of an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner an appellant can be allowed to go into any ground of appeal not specified in the grounds of appeal if the Appellate Assistant Commissioner allows it Appeals against the order of an Appellate Assistant Commissioner be provided in section of the Act for which a period of sixty days is prescribed within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an order under sub section of section the assessee or the Commissioner may by application in he prescribed form accompanied where application is made by the assessee by a fee of one hundred rupees require the <ORG> to refer to the <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order and the <ORG> shall within ninety days of the receipt of such application draw up a statement of the case and refer it to the <ORG> Provided that if in the exercise of its powers under sub section <ORG> refuses to state a case which it has been required by the assessee to state the assessee to state the assessee may within thirty days from the date on which be receives notice of the refusal to state the case withdrawn his application and if he does so the fee paid shall be refunded Thus according to this section after an application is made within the prescribed time on the prescribed form with the request fee the <ORG> has to draw up a case and refer it to <ORG> and if it refuses to state the case which it has been required by the assessee to state the assessee may within the prescribed time withdraw his application and sub section of section provides that if the Appellate <ORG> refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises an application can be made to <ORG> for an order to the Appellate <ORG> to state the case and refer it and the Appellate <ORG> is then bound to state the case and refer it to <ORG> Sub section provides that if <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements in a case referred under section are sufficient to enable it to determine the question raise then it may refer the case back to the <ORG> to make such additions or alteration as the <ORG> may direct A combined reading of section and the statutory rules made under section shows that an application for reference to <ORG> has to be made i Within sixty days from the date of service of the order ii on a prescribed form iii the applicant has to indicate the questions which he wants to be referred to <ORG> and on which the requires the case to the stated iv the <ORG> cannot suo motu refer any question which is dehors paragraph of the application made on the prescribed form Rule makes certain rules applicable mutates mutandis to an application under sub section I of section but it must be noted that rule is not one of them and therefore at the time when an application for making a reference under section is heard the <ORG> is confined to the ground set forth in the application for reference and a fortiori cannot suo motu raise a question of law which has not been set forth in paragraph of the prescribed form Thus it was held that the <ORG> had no discretion to raise questions which were not in the application made on the form prescribed for applications under section This in my opinion supports the construction placed on section read with rules made under section of the Act the <ORG> cannot raise a question of law suo motu The form of the question before us however is confined to the power of the <ORG> to refer a point which was not raised before of considered by the <ORG> and in this case this particular question was not in the prescribed application not was it raised within the sixty days allowed by section of the Income tax Act and the question referred to us has to be read in the light of paragraph which shows that objection was taken as to the assessees right to get a reference made on this point but the reference was made by the <ORG> suo motu and I have already held that a reference suo motu is not within the contemplation of law Under section of section it is only when the Appellate <ORG> refuses to state a question of law on the ground that no such question of law arises and <ORG> is not satisfied with the correctness of this decision that it can call upon the <ORG> to state the case and refer it Similarly in sub section the jurisdiction or the power of <ORG> requiring the Appellate <ORG> to treat the application made under subsection of section was within time arises if the Appellate <ORG> has rejected the application on the ground that it is barred by time Under sub section it is again when a statement is made to <ORG> and it is not satisfied that the statement is sufficient to determine the question raised it can send it back to the Appellate <ORG> to make such additions or alternations as <ORG> may direct The words of the section therefore show that the jurisdiction of <ORG> arises when a case is stated or is directed to be stated and a case can only be stated if an application that behalf is made on the prescribed form or if <ORG> finds that the <ORG> has wrongly refused to state case on the ground that no question of law arises It shows therefore that a case must be raised before the <ORG> before it can make the reference or refuse to make the reference and in these circumstances it cannot be said that a question would arise merely because the facts justify the deduction of a question of law from the facts found even though the question is never raised before the <ORG> In support of the view that unless a question has been raised and decided by a <ORG> no questions of law can be said to arise there is a large number of authorities It was held in this case after referring to rules and of the Appellate <ORG> Rules that the <ORG> could not be directed to state a questions of law which had not been decided by the <ORG> The reference there was to two questions Nos and which had not been raised before the <ORG> and therefore could not be considered or decided by the <ORG> commissioner of <ORG> Delhi it was contended that under section it is sufficient to state in a application that the <ORG> may refer to the <ORG> questions of Law arising out of the order of the <ORG> In others words it is not for the assessee to formulate the questions but this contention was repelled because of rule A of the India <ORG> Rules which gives the form of a application under sub section of section of the Act What it means is that in every case where the <ORG> decides a question of law it can approach <ORG> with the prayer to give a finding to as whether the view taken by the <ORG> on a questions of law is correct The duty of <ORG> under section is to decide the questions of law raised by the case referred to them by the Commissioner and it is for the Commissioner to state formally the questions which arises In my view what the word any really connotes in this context is that it for example ten questions of law arise in a case it is open to the assessee to choose all or any of them as he likes and require a reference in that respect only but it is he who has to exercise his choice in the first instance and none else Commissioner nor <ORG> can it of his or its dissatisfaction with the commissioners decision on a point which was never raised before him and it only when it is only when it is so dissatisfied that it can take action under sub section According to this case the assessee has to make an indication of the questions of law which he wishes to raise and he can require any one of them to be referred to <ORG> and in the case of refusal the jurisdiction of <ORG> arises if there is its revenue in that the questions to be referred must be raised considered and decided by the <ORG> before any reference can be made And how can there be a mandamus if the question has never been raised at all In <NAME> Commissioner of Income tax it was held that the jurisdiction of <ORG> under section is confined only to those matter which are contained in the application made to the Commissioner under sub section of section and it is only in relation to such matters that the refusal of the Commissioner to state the case can be investigated by <ORG> and therefore if a point is not raised before the Commissioner his refusal to state the case cannot be declared to be unjustified In this case it was held that directions under section are in the nature of mandamus and a direction will not ordinarily he issued to the <ORG> unless the <ORG> was required to do and had an opportunity of considering the questions in other words unless there was evidence of a distinct demand and such a demand was met by refusal Thus it comes to this that according to nature of the proceedings under section which given to <ORG> not a supervisory but merely an advisory jurisdiction <ORG> can be asked to given an opinion on a questions which has been stated by the <ORG> or which <ORG> call upon the <ORG> to state and in the latter case it can only arise where the <ORG> was asked by the assessee in the form indicated by section to consider the questions and to state it to <ORG> <NAME> case supports this contention It was held in this case by <ORG> that if a questions is not raised in the appeal before the Assistant Commissioner of Income tax it cannot be said to arise out of an order made by him under section and the assessee has no right to require the Commissioner to refer the question This case was severely curtsied on the ground that no reasons had been given by the learned judges but in my opinion if the decision and I say so with respect is confined to the facts of that case no fault can be found with it After referring to section and <NAME> was of the opinion that a questions of law which an Appellate <ORG> can be required to refer under section is a question of law arising out of such an order that is the order of the Appellate <ORG> passed on appeal and when it was contended that though the question had not been raised before the <ORG> it can well be said to arise out of its order if on the facts of the case appearing from the order the question fairly arises <NAME> observed This judgment has been criticised by counsel for the assessee on the ground that if literally applied it would make it possible for the shutting out of a question of law being raised in the High Court where although a question has raised and argued before a <ORG> but has been absolutely ignored even though such a question may be of very great importance but the observations of the learned Judge must be confined to the facts of that case where the two questions which were then sought to be raised had never been either raised or argued before the <ORG> But when we are considering the powers of the <ORG> we must presume that they will be exercised in accordance with law in that all questions which are in the grounds of appeal and are raised and argued before the <ORG> will be decided by it and if they are not so decided it is open to the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be to indicate in the application made under section that the questions were raised and argued but not decided and if even then the case is not stated an application under section might be a proper remedy But it is not necessary to decide this question really because it does not arise on the facts of the present case In two other cases <ORG> has taken the same view as was taken by <NAME> in <NAME> case it was held that a question as the apportionment of profits between British Indian and Indian States could not be raised as it was not question referred to <ORG> and as it was not a question raised before <ORG> it could not be said that it was a question which arose out of the order of <ORG> It was argued in this case that the questions actually refereed to <ORG> were wide enough to cover the question of apportionment of profits but it was observed that the <ORG> had to understand the question referred in the light of the statement of facts and of the case which is the basis of the reference to the <ORG> and after referring to <NAME> case it was held that the question can arise out of the order of the <ORG> only if the order discloses that the question of apportionment was not raised before the <ORG> nor before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner In these circumstances it is impossible to hold that it is a question which arise out of the order of <ORG> and which is covered by the question that are actually referred to us On an application being made under section of the Act it was held by <ORG> that as the question was not raised before the <ORG> it did not arise out of its order and therefore it was not open to <ORG> to go being that decision If the <ORG> decline to make a reference on the ground that no question of law arises the applicant has the right to move <ORG> and <ORG> may if it is satisfied that the decision of the <ORG> in refusing to make a reference was not correct direct a case to be stated and referred We respectfully agree with the view expressed by <ORG> At page it was observed In my opinion it is not proper to overlook the fact that the jurisdiction of <ORG> upon a reference under section of the Income tax Act is purely advisory that the sole task of the <ORG> is to answer the question actually referred on the case stated and that it is no part of its duty or right to give further advice or to set about raising other questions and proceeding to decide them It is true that this last case has reference only to the practice of <ORG> but it is significant that <ORG> has pronounced decisively in favour of the stricter view of section of the Income tax Act The section confers a special and limited jurisdiction upon <ORG> to decide upon specific questions of law which have been raised between the assessee and the <ORG> before the <ORG> and upon which questions the parties are at issue and the correct interpretation of section is that the question of law which a party seeks to refer must be a question of law which has been actually raised before the <ORG> or actually dealt with in its order In this case it was contended that the expression any question of law arising out of such order in section should be construed to mean that the question of law should fairly arise out of the facts appearing from the order and not necessarily that the question of law should have been actually argued before the <ORG> or dealt with in the <ORG>s order but this contention was repelled was held that the jurisdiction with which <ORG> is invested under the Income tax Act is of an exceptional nature and in hearing the reference <ORG> has session only of such question of law as has been duly raised before the Appellate <ORG> and upon which there is statement of the case it was held that the special jurisdiction of <ORG> under section depends upon the strict fulfilment of the preliminary conditions required by the parties before the <ORG> or dealt with in the order of the <ORG> <ORG> has no jurisdiction to discuss and answer that question Commissioner of Income tax Punjab which was an application for mandamus and where a question of law was not raised in the appeal to the Assistant Commissioner or decided by him it was held that it did not arise out of the order under section which was a case decided by <NAME> and <NAME> JJ It was held in this case that it cannot be said that under no circumstances can a point of law be said to arise out of an order of <ORG> under section of the Income tax Act simply because the point has not been raised and discussed in the order itself The <ORG> refused to refer these questions and it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the subject of a reference to <ORG> under section need not necessarily be one which had been raised and discussed in the appellate order and that fundamental question such as want of jurisdiction is one which was said to arise out of the order of <ORG> whether it had been raised in the appeal or discussed in the appellate order or not and this contention was accepted Now this was a question of jurisdiction and the question had been raised before the <ORG> under section and therefore there was no defect due to there being no application on the prescribed form within the period of limitation and whether such fundamental question as the question of jurisdiction should or should not be held to arise out of the appellate order of the <ORG> is not the matter before us in the present case and it is not necessary therefore to express any opinion as to the correctness of this judgment and it must be confined to the facts of that particular case Under section <ORG> it has been held in many case is bound to decide the questions of law raised thereby meaning on a case stated by the <ORG> itself or under the directions of <ORG> or after <ORG> has required some additions to be made and they have been made <NAME> referring to this objection said Since the <ORG> has although the question was not argued before it raised the question of law and referred it to us we are bound to determine it under sub section and in this view of the matter the learned Judge did not discuss the wide question as to the correct meaning to be placed on the words question of law arising out of such order and was of the opinion that these words would fall to be determined only under an application under section of the Income tax Act <NAME> <NAME> although he recognised that the question had been given up and not argued before the <ORG> and that the case had been stated by the <ORG> gave his opinion as to the meaning of the words arising out of such order and said Now looking at the plain language of the section apart from any authority I should have stated that a question of law arose out of the order of the <ORG> if such a question was apparent on the order itself or it could be raised on the facts found by the <ORG> and which were stated in the order I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction this <ORG> to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by the <ORG> The section does not say so and there is no reason why we should construe the expression arising out of such order in a manner unwarranted by the ordinary grammatical construction of that expression This <ORG> has no jurisdiction to decide questions which have not been referred by the <ORG> If the <ORG> does not refer a question of law under section which arises out of the order then the only jurisdiction of the <ORG> is to require the <ORG> to refer the same under section It is true that the <ORG> has jurisdiction to resettle questions of law so as to bring out the real issue between the parties but it is not open to the <ORG> to raise new question which have not been referred to it by the <ORG> It was recognised that if the <ORG> does not refer a question of law under section if it arises out of the order then the only jurisdiction of the <ORG> is to require the <ORG> to refer the same under section and that the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to decide questions which have not been referred by the <ORG> At the bottom of page the learned Chief Justice said in so many words that the <ORG> had actually raised the question of law and referred it for the opinion of the <ORG> and under section they were bound to decide the question and it was not open to the Advocate General once a question of law had been raised by the <ORG> to ask the <ORG> not to give its opinion Besides being obiter the observations of the learned Chief Justic are not in accord with the scheme of section and the rules made under section of the Act which show that section becomes operative only if the jurisdiction is invoked in a particular manner and if the <ORG> was first invited to give its decision on the questions sought to be referred This view finds further support from language sub sections and of section where the satisfaction of <ORG> with the order of the <ORG> is indicated and this can only arise if the <ORG> has been called upon and has given its decision on the question sought to be raised Counsel then referred to a judgment of <ORG> in Commissioner of Income tax Bombay Aden <NAME> Notices were issued to the assessees at Shikarpur under section of the Income tax Act but they ignored the notices He must have been acting under the powers given to him under section a of the Act but he expressed no opinion whether such assessment was one made under section The matter was taken to the Commissioner and subsequently an application was made for stating the case of the Judicial Commissioners which was refused by <ORG> who ordered the Commissioner under section of the Act to state a case and refer it to them for their decision and the decision of that Court was in favour of the assessees and an appeal was then taken to <ORG> In this case the assessees under section Applied to the Commissioner requiring him to refer three questions of law which he contended arose out of the order of the Assistant Commissioner which the Commissioner refused to do The assessees then applied under section for an order requiring the Commissioner to state the case and referred two questions for the determination of <ORG> and it was contended that the Court had power under section to order the Commissioner to state a case and refer any question of law which the Court was of opinion arose out of the order of the Assistant Commissioner not withstanding that such question of law was not duly raised before either the Assistant Commissioner or the Commissioner A Special Bench of <ORG> held that the Court has no jurisdiction to order the Commissioner to state a case which the assessee has not duly required the Commissioner to refer under section and it was also observed that section the Court at the hearing of an application by the assessee has seisin only of such questions of law as have duly been raised by or before the Commissioner and upon which the Commissioner has expressed his opinion <ORG> in <NAME> case however refused to accept the view taken by <ORG> and was of the opinion that an assessee can require the Commissioner to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of an order or decision of the Assistant Commissioner which at any rate would not be the law now particularly in view of the requirements of an application in a prescribed form under section of the present Income tax Act The question raised and decided by the <ORG> was that on a proper construction of section the amount paid for municipal taxes and urban immovable property tax should be allowed as deduction in computing the income from property and the two aspects of the question were that this tax should be deducted in the first instance before arriving at the bona fide annual value and that the annual value of the property being ascertained these are permissible deductions under heads iv and of sub section In this case observations fations of <NAME> were followed and it is a fundamental principle of administration of justice that a litigant has a right to present at any stage any question of law arising from the facts found by a <ORG> and that the assessee has to plead facts and not law and the <ORG> is always under an obligation to apply the appropriate law to the facts found by it Ordinarily a <ORG> has to decide those questions which are raised before it and it and it does not and cannot decide questions which are not raised before it or are given up and in income tax matters the jurisdiction is very much more limited be the function of the <ORG> is nothing more than advisory and it has to advise the <ORG> as to whether the decision made by it has to advise the <ORG> as to whether the decision made by it on questions of law is correct or not There was an appeal to the Special Commissioners from the assessment and then they were required to state a case upon their determination and having so invoked the jurisdiction of the Commissioners it was held that the applicants cannot afterwards be heard to say that there was no jurisdiction at all At page <NAME> said The language of the question clearly indicates that the question of law has to be determined on the facts of this case The cases that have been discussed above show that i the jurisdiction of <ORG> the Income tax Act is advisory and a limited one ii only such question of law arise out of an order of the <ORG> which have been raised and dealt with by it iii in order to raise a question of law the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be must make an application within a specified time on a prescribed form raising the questions of law which arise out of the order and specify the question on which reference is sought iv on such an application being made it is for <ORG> to decide whether the questions are questions of law and if they are questions of law to refer them for the opinion of <ORG> if <ORG> refuses to refer the questions the applicant can approach the Court under section to direct that a reference be made vi the jurisdiction of <ORG> is limited to the question raised and referred <ORG> cannot raise any question which has not been referred to it either under section or section vii the <ORG> itself has no power to raise a question suo motu Its powers are also limited to the provisions of section or section and viii once the question is properly raised and reference made to <ORG> <ORG> is bound to answer the question I would therefore answer the question referred to <ORG> in the negative <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of perusing the exhaustive judgment of my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> and agree with him that the first of the questions propounded for our consideration in this case should be answered in the negative In the first place although it does not directly out of the question but only out of the sixth paragraph of the statement of the case I agree with his view that the matter contained in the second question was never properly before the <ORG> under section of the Income tax Act and should never have been allowed to be raised at all on this ground alone It is therefore with some diffidence and regret that I express the opinion that the view expressed by so many <ORG> and adopted by me learned brother that in no case if a question of law has not been raised and decided by the <ORG> can a reference be made to the <ORG> is too sweeping as it stands and requires some qualification The other kind of case I have in mind is one where a point has been raised and argued in the appeal but from inadvertence or because the point was considered to be unworthly of serious consideration it has been referred to in the appellate order This could lead to unfortunate consequences and I do not think that the remedy suggested by Mr <NAME> for the aggrieved party that he should go <ORG> under article of the constitute for a mandamus directing the <ORG> to write a fresh appellate order dealing with the point in question is very satisfactory <NAME> <NAME> I agree that the first question referred to us should be answered in the negative
