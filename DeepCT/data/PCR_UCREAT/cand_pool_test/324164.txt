The applicant seeks a writ of certiorari for quashing an order of <ORG> passed on in the following circumstances After the filing of the revision petition <ORG> gave to the opponent No a notice to show cause why the revision petition should not be dismissed as barred by time In response to this notice the said opponent stated that he had applied for a copy of the order of <ORG> on that the copy of the order was supplied to him on and that therefore excluding the time taken by him in obtaining the copy of the order the revision petition was within time <ORG> did not pass any order as to whether the opponent No was entitled to claim that the time required for obtaining the copy of the order of <ORG> should be excluded in computing the period of limitation prescribed by the proviso to Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act Accordingly <ORG> made an order remanding the case to <ORG> with the direction to publish the application of <ORG> for the transfer for inviting the objections and then to dispose of the petition after an enquiry into the question whether the transfer was genuine Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act <ORG> was debarred from entertaining the revision petition as it was filed after the lapse of thirty days from the date of the order of <ORG> and the opponent No was not entitled to claim that the time required for obtaining the copy of the order of <ORG> should be excluded in computing the period of limitation But as there is no dispute as to the material dates having a bearing on the question it is not necessary to remit the matter to <ORG> for determination of the question of limitation which is now one of pure law There is no provision in the Motor Vehicles Act for the exclusion of the time required for obtaining a copy of the order of <ORG> sought to be revised under Section A The question therefore arises whether by virtue of Section Limitation Act the operation of Section of the Limitation Act is attracted and the time taken by opponent No in obtaining a copy of the order of <ORG> can be excluded thereunder Section runs as follows Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply It cannot be disputed that the Motor Vehicles Act is a special law prescribing by Section A a period of limitation for a revision petition under that section The argument of <NAME> was that Section had no applicability here for the reason that the first schedule to the Limitation Act did not prescribe any period of limitation for a revision petition under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act or for the matter I of that for any revision petition and therefore it could not be said that when Section A provided for an application under that section a period of limitation it prescribed a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule In our view on a true construction of Section Limitation Act the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be accepted It is true that Section cannot apply unless the special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule Section is a saving provision and its real object is to provide that where there is a special law of limitation it shall override the general law of limitation except to the extent expressly specified in the section The variation or difference may arise either because the first schedule prescribes a different period of limitation or because it omits to prescribe any period of limitation A special law may provide a period of limitation and schedule may omit to do so The expression a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule occurring in Section can not be construed as meaning that schedule must also positively prescribe the period of limitation If the construction sought to be put by the learned counsel for the petitioner were accepted the result would be that Sections to and will apply to the special law when that law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from that specifically prescribed therefor by the first schedule When the same period of limitation is prescribed in the schedule as well in the special law these provisions of the Limitation Act will apply proprio vigore without the aid of Section But the provisions will be inapplicable if the special law prescribes a period of limitation and the schedule omits to do so In our judgment it would be absurd to think that the <ORG> intended that the aforesaid provision should apply in the first two cases only and not in the third case We can think of no valid reason for such an exclusion of the application of Sections to and to a special law prescribing for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation and schedule I omitting to prescribe any period therefor In our judgment if the first schedule to the Limitation Act omits to prescribe any period of limitation for a particular suit appeal or application and the special law provides a period of limitation in such suits appeals or applications then Section will apply to the special law In that case the question of the applicability of Section of the Limitation Act to the Bombay Land Requisition Act came up for consideration Section of the Bombay Act contained a provision for an appeal against the decision of a special officer under Section and prescribed a period of limitation of sixty days from the date of the decision It was contended in <ORG> that the Bombay Land Requisition Act was not a special law prescribing a period of limitation different from the period prescribed for an appeal under Section by Schedule to the Limitation Act It may also be different in the sense that it departs from the period of limitation fixed for various appeals under the Limitation Act If the first schedule to the Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act We are conscious of the fact that the language used by the <ORG> is perhaps not very happy but we must put upon it a construction which will reconcile the various difficulties caused by the other sections of the Limitation Act and which will give effect to the object which obviously the <ORG> had in mind because if we were to give Section the meaning which Mr <NAME> contends for then the result would be that even Section of the Limitation Act would not apply to this special law The result would be that although an appeal may be barred by limitation it would not be liable to be dismissed under Section Therefore on a true and sensible construction of Section it must be held that for the purpose of that section the Motor Vehicles Act is a special law Section A of which prescribes a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule to the Limitation Act It was then argued that even if section of the Limitation Act applied to the Motor Vehicles Act the opponent No could not deduct copying time for filing the revision petition as under section time for obtaining copies was to be excluded only in case of an appeal an application for leave to appeal and an application for a review of judgment and that an application under section A of the Motor Vehicles Act did not fall under any description of the application mentioned in Section of the Limitation Act The fact that Clause a of Section Limitation Act makes section applicable to a special or local law does not mean that every provision of Section will necessarily apply to every case under the special or local law irrespective of question whether the particular sub section sought to be applied is in terms applicable to such a case where the application in respect of which limitation is sought to be computed is not one of the types referred to in Sub section then the time taken in obtaining copies cannot be excluded in making such computation In that case it was held that by virtue of Section the period prescribed by Section of the and Berar Sales Tax Act would be regarded as the period prescribed by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act for the purpose of Section of the Limitation Act and Sections to and would apply In the Patna case <NAME> expressed the opinion that Section Limitation Act should be liberally construed that in view of the provision in that section namely that for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal and application by any special or local law it would not be straining the law to hold that the main principle laid down in Section of the Limitation Act that the period for obtaining copies should be excluded in computing the period of limitation in certain cases had been made applicable by Section Limitation Act in the case of a suit appeal or application under the special law for which a period of limitation had been prescribed and this would cover an application under Section and Income tax Act The learned Judge however based his ultimate conclusion not on the terms of Section of the Limitation Act but on the general principle of section It is difficult to accept the Patna view based on equitable construction of Section and on the general principle underlying Section of the Limitation Act The enumeration in Section of different categories of legal proceedings in which time can be excluded is itself a pointer to the fact that the descriptive terms of legal proceedings have been used in that section in technical sense It must be remembered that it was while dealing with the question of the starting point of limitation under article for the execution of a decree or an order where there has been an appeal that <ORG> made the observation that There is no definition of appeal in the Civil Procedure Code but their Lordships have no doubt that any application by a party to an appellate <ORG> asking it to set aside or revise a decision of a subordinate <ORG> is an appeal within the ordinary acceptation of the term and that it is no less an appeal because it is irregular or incompetent The reasoning which their Lordships of <ORG> gave for reading the word appeal as used in article in a wider sense was It is at least an intelligible rule that so long as there is any question sub judice between any of the parties those affected shall not be compelled to pursue the so often thorny path of execution which if the final result is against them may lead to no advantage This reasoning has clearly no applicability in the construction of Section and there is no warrant for reading the observation of <ORG> as laying down that the term appeal must be understood in its ordinary acceptation wherever it has been used in the Limitation Act If as we think an application under Section A Motor Vehicles Act is not an appeal or any application of the types referred to in Section then the opponent No was not entitled to claim deduction on account of the time taken by him in obtaining the copy of the order of <ORG> When the order proposed to be passed was laid on the table of the <ORG> for inspection of the counsel appearing in the case learned counsel appearing for the opponent No sought leave to address some arguments on the applicability of the decision in ILR Nag AIR Nag which was not cited at the bar He laid emphasis on the words for the purpose of determining any period of Limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application occurring in Section Limitation Act and said that they made Section Limitation Act applicable to an application in revision permissible under any special or local law for which limitation has been prescribed therein The argument that as Section Limitation Act itself provides that for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any application for any special or local law the provisions inter alia of Section shall apply if not expressly excluded therefore Section Limitation Act would apply to an application in revision ignores the fact that Section does not deal with the applicability of Section alone It makes the provisions contained in several sections of the Limitation Act applicable for purposes of determining the period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application If Section had been so worded as to say that the determination of any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law shall be as in Section the matter would have been different But it says inter alia that the provisions contained in Section shall apply If Section is applicable to any special or local law then what that section in effect says is that the limitation prescribed by the special or local law shall be read as if incorporated in the first schedule and on this fiction Section and other provisions mentioned in clause a shall be applied Sales Tax AIR All and it has been held that Section Limitation Act provides for the exclusion of time only in computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal an application for leave to appeal and an application for review It has been further laid down in the Allahabad case that there is no justification for holding that Section enlarges the scope of the provisions made applicable by it to computation of period of limitation prescribed under a special or local law beyond the scope plainly laid down in those provisions when they are applied for the purpose of computing the period of limitation under the Indian Limitation Act itself This distinction has been recognised by Section of the Motor Vehicles Act which deals with appeals and by Section A which is concerned with a revision petition in a case in which no appeal lies It is well known that the right of appeal is a substantive right created by a statute and that the appellate court when it interferes with a decision of a lower court does so not because there has been a gross injustice or hardship to a party but because it disagrees with the conclusions arrived at by the lower court whether on fact or on law Even when an appeal is dismissed the appellate court exercises jurisdiction It must be noted that under Section A revisional powers can be exercised without an application of any of the parties concerned and when that section speaks of a revision petition being filed by a person aggrieved by an order of <ORG> within thirty days of the order it only provides a procedure for invoking the revisional jurisdiction of <ORG> It is therefore erroneous to say that for the purposes of the Motor Vehicles Act there is no distinction between an appeal and a revision and therefore a revision application would fall within the term appeal as used in Section Limitation Act <NAME> learned counsel for opponent No further said that even if the revision petition filed by the opponent No before <ORG> was barred by time the order of <ORG> should be affirmed as that body could suo motu set aside the order of <ORG> on finding it improper or illegal That being so it is not necessary to consider whether under Section A <ORG> is competent to act on its own motion when an application filed by a person aggrieved by an order of <ORG> Is barred by time <ORG> has been given the power to summon both the parties to the application if it thinks necessary It is only when <ORG> is satisfied that the transfer of a permit may properly be made that he can under Sub rule take further steps for making the transfer effective For these reasons we allow this petition and issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decision dated the th November of <ORG>
