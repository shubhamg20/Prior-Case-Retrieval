Validity Wheth er infringes fundamental rights Right not to be deprived of property save by authority of law Right to acquire hold and dispose of property Right to equal protection of law Constitution of India Arts HEADNOTE The Governor General of India finding that on account of mismanagement and neglect a situation had arisen in the affairs of <ORG> which had prejudicially affected the production of an essen tial commodity and had caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community and that an emergency had thereby arisen which rendered it necessary to make special provision for the proper management and administration of the said company promulgated an Ordinance which was subse quently reenacted in the form of an Act of the <ORG> called the sholpur Spinning and Weaving Company Emergency Provisions Act the net result of which was that the Managing Agents of the said company were dismissed the directors holding office at the time automatically vacated their office the Government was authorised to appoint new directors the rights of the shareholders of the company were curtailed in the matters of voting appointment of directors passing of resolutions and applying for winding up and power was also given to the Government to further modify the Indian Companies Act in its application to the company and in accordance with the provisions of the Ordi nance new directors were appointed by the Government iii that as the Act did not impose any restrictions on the petitioner right to acquire hold and dispose of his shares there was no infringement of Art and assuming that the restrictions imposed on the right of voting etc were restrictions on the right to acquire hold or dispose of property within Art such restric tions were reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the public namely to secure the supply of a commodity essential to the community and to prevent serious unemploy ment amongst a section of the people and were therefore completely protected by cl of Art that though the <ORG> had proceeded against one company only and its shareholders inasmuch as even one corporation or a group of persons can be taken to be class by itself for the purposes of legislation provided there is sufficient basis or reason for it and there is a strong presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment the burden was on the petitioner to prove that there were also other companies similarly situated and this company alone had been discrimi nated against and as he had failed to discharge this burden the impugned Act cannot be held to have denied to the peti tioner the right to equal protection of the laws referred to in Art He and the petitioner was not therefore entitled to any relief under Art and even though when a law is made applicable to a class of persons or things and the classification is based on differentia having a rational relation to the object sought to be attained it can be no objection to its constitutional validity that its applica tion is found to affect only one person or thing Whilst all reasonable pre sumptions must undoubtedly be made in favour of the consti tutional validity of a law made competent legislature no such presumption could be raised in this case as on the face of it the Act was discriminatory and the petitioner could not be called upon to prove that similar mismanagement existed in other companies The argument that the pre sumption being in favour of the <ORG> the onus is on the petitioner to show that there are other individuals or companies equally guilty of mismanagement prejudicially affecting the production of an essential commodity and causing serious unemployment amongst certain section of the community does not in such circumstances arise for the simple reason that here there has been no classification at all and in any case the basis of classification by its very nature is much wider and cannot in its application be limited only to this company and its shareholders and that being so there is no reason to throw on the petitioner the almost impossible burden of proving that there are other companies which are in fact precisely and in all particulars similarly situated In so far as the petitioner rights as a shareholder were curtailed he was entitled to apply for relief under Art An incorporated company therefore can come up to <ORG> for enforcement of its fundamental rights and so may the individual shareholders to enforce their own but as the company and its shareholders are in law separate entities it would not be open to an individual shareholder to complain of a law which affects the fundamental right of the company except to the extent that it constitutes an infraction of his own rights as well i it means and implies the acquiring of the entire title of the expropriated owner whatever the nature or extent of that right might be The guarantee against the denial of equal protection of the laws does not mean that identically the same rules of law should be made applicable to all persons within the territory of India in spite of differences of circumstances and conditions contem plates only confiscation or destruction of property in exercise of what are known as police powers in American law for which no compensation is necessary DAS The question whether an Act has deprived a person of his property must depend on whether it has taken away the substantial bulk of the rights constituting his property Where the most important rights possessed by the shareholders of a company are still preserved by an Act even though certain privileges incidental to the ownership of the shares have been put in abeyance the shareholders cannot be said to have been deprived of their property in the sense in which that word is used in Art FAZAL ALI <NAME> and <NAME> Except in the matter writs in the nature of habsas corpus no one but those whose rights are directly affected by a law can raise the question of the constitutionality of a law and claim relief under Art <ORG> classification which is arbitrary and which is made without any basis is no classification and a proper classification must always rest upon some difference and must hear a reasonable and lust relation to the things in respect of which it is proposed But the presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of constitutional principles I have read the judgment prepared by Mr Justice <NAME> In respect of the arguments advanced to challenge the validity of the impugned Act under articles and of the Constitution of India I agree with his line of reasoning and conclusion and have nothing more to add I agree with the line of reasoning and the conclusion of Mr Justice <NAME> as regards the second point relating to the inva lidity of the Act on the ground that it infringes article of the Constitution and have nothing more to add The facts urged in the petition and the points raised on behalf of the petitioner before us are fully set forth in the judgments of my brethren <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and I do not wish to repeat them here It is sufficient to say that the main grounds on which the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Emergency Provisions Act Act No XXVIII of which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act has been assailed is that it infringes three fundamental rights these being the right to property secured by article of the Constitution the right to acquire hold and dispose of property guaranteed to every citizen by article and the right to equal protection of the laws guaran teed by article It has been held in a number of cases in the United States of America that no one except those whose rights are directly affected by a law can raise the question of the constitutionality of that law Nor does it make any difference that other persons who may be injured are persons of the same race or occupation The company and the shareholders are in law separate entities and if the allegation is made that any property belonging to the company has been taken possession of without compensa tion or the right enjoyed by the company under article has been infringed it would be for the company to come forward to assert or vindicate its own rights and not for any individual shareholder to do so The only serious point which in my opinion arises in the case is whether article of the Constitution is in any way infringed by the impugned Act A law apply ing to one person or one class of persons is constitutional if there is sufficient basis or reason for it There can be no doubt that article provides one of the most valuable and important guarantees in the Constitution which should not be allowed to be whittled down and while ac cepting the statement of Professor <NAME> as a correct exposition of the principles underlying this guarantee wish to lay particular emphasis on the principle enunciated by him that any classification which is arbitrary and which is made without any basis is no classification and a proper classification must always rest upon some difference and must bear a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect of which it is proposed No resolution passed at any meeting of the share holders of the company shall be given effect to unless approved by <ORG> <NAME> the argument appears to be a plausible one but it requires a careful examination and while examining it two principles have to be borne in mind that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual in those cases where on account of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not applica ble to others that single individual may be treated as a class by himself that it is the accepted doctrine of the American courts which I consider to be well founded on principle that the presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles A clear enunciation of this latter doctrine is to be found in <NAME> <ORG> in which the relevant passage runs as follows It must be presumed that a legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds The onus is therefore on the petitioner to show that the legislation which is impugned is arbitrary and unreasonable and there are other companies in the country which should have been subjected to the same disabilities because the reasons which led the <ORG> to impose State control upon the Sholapur company are equally applicable to them A reference to the Parliamentary proceedings shows that some time ago a representation was made on behalf of a section of the shareholders of the Sholapur company to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies in Bombay against the conduct of the managing agents and <ORG> was moved to order a special inquiry into the affairs of the company It also revealed that the persons who were responsible for the mismanagement were guilty of certain acts and omissions which brought them under the purview of the law The Minister for Indus try who sponsored the Bill in explaining what distin guished the case of the Sholapur mill from the other mills against whom there might be charges of mismanagement made it clear in the course of the debate that certain condi tions had to be fulfilled before the Government can and should intervene and he set out these conditions as fol lows The undertaking must relate to an industry which is of national importance If it appears that it is completely uneconomic and cannot be managed at all there is no sense in Government taking charge of it If anything it will mean the Government will have to waste money which belongs to the taxpayer on an uneconomic unit Professor <NAME> dealing with the question of classification in exercise of police power makes the following observa tions There is no rule for determining when classification for the police power is reasonable In doing this the <ORG> may consider matters of common knowledge matters common report tile history of the times and to sustain it they will assume every state of facts which can be conceived of as existing at the time Of legislation proof it must be shown that there is no reasonable basis for the classification In this particular case the Government initially took control of <ORG> by means of an Ordinance Ordinance No II of of which the preamble runs as follows Whereas on account of mismanagement and neglect a situation has arisen in the affairs of <ORG> which has prejudicially af fected the production of an essential commodity and has caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community And whereas an emergency has arisen which renders it necessary to make special provision for the proper manage ment and administration of the aforesaid Company Now therefore In the course of the Parliamentary debate reference was made to the fact that the country was facing an acute cloth shortage and one of the reasons which apparently influenced the promulgation of the Ordinance and the passing of the Act was that the mismanagement of the company had gravely affected the production of an essential commodity Therefore it seems to me that to say that one particular mill has been arbitrarily and unreasonably selected and subjected to discriminatory treatment would be an entirely wrong propo sition Article of the Constitution as already stated lays down an important fundamental right which should be closely and vigilantly guarded but in construing it we should not adopt a doctrinaire approach which might choke all benefi cial legislation I think that the petitioner has failed to make out any case for granting the writs or directions asked for and the petition should therefore be dismissed with costs The petitioner complains that the impugned Act and the action of <ORG> pursuant thereto have infringed the fundamental rights conferred on him by arti cles and of the Constitution with the result that the enactment is unconstitutional and void and the inter ference by the <ORG> in the affairs of the company is unauthorised and illegal Section a empowers the Central <ORG> to appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be directors of the company for the purpose of taking over its management and administration Notwith standing anything contained in the Companies Act or in the memorandum or articles of association of the company a it shall not be lawful for the shareholders of the company or any other person to nominate or appoint any person to be a director of the company no resolution passed at any meeting of the shareholders of the company shall be given effect to unless approved by the Central <ORG> no proceeding for the winding up of the company or for the appointment of a receiver in respect thereof shall lie in any Court unless by or with the sanction of the Central <ORG> to the provisions contained in sub section and to the other provisions of this Act By section the provisions of the Act are to have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act Section provides for delegation of powers to the Govern ment of Bombay to be exercised subject to the directions of <ORG> and section bars suits or other proceedings against <ORG> or <ORG> or any director for any damage caused or likely to be caused by anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of this Act which thus affects the petitioner and his co sharehold ers while leaving untouched the shareholders of all other companies including those engaged in the production of essential commodities denies to the petitioner the equal protection of the laws under article of the Constitution The correct approach to this question is first to see what rights have been con ferred or protection extended to persons similarly situated The relevant protection is to be found in the provisions of the Indian Companies Act which regulates the rights and obligations of the shareholders of incorporated companies in India It is argued however that article does not make it incumbent on the <ORG> always to make laws applicable to all persons generally and that it is open to the Legis lature to classify persons and things and subject them to the operation of a particular law according to the aims and objects which that law is designed to secure Reliance was placed in support of this argument on certain American decisions dealing with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution A legislature empowered to make laws on a wide range of sub jects must of necessity have the power of making special laws to attain particular objects and must for that pur pose possess large powers of distinguishing and classifying the persons or things to be brought under the operation of such laws provided the basis of such classification has a just and reasonable relation to the object which the legis lature has in view If a law is made applicable to a class of persons or things and the classification is based upon differentia having a rational relation to the object sought to be attained it can be no objection to its constitutional validity that its application is found to affect only one person or thing crores and upwards and it may be found that there is only one such company for the time being to which the law could be applied Whilst all reasonable pre sumption must undoubtedly be made in support of the consti tutional validity of a law made by a competent legislature the circumstances of the present case would seem to my mind to exclude such presumption Hostile discrimination is writ large over the face of the impugned Act and it dis closes no grounds for such legislative intcrvcntion There is thus nothing in the record even by way of allegation which the petitioner need take steps to rebut Supposing howev er that the impugned Act was passed on the same grounds as were mentioned in the preamble to the repealed Ordinance namely mismanagement and neglect prejudicially affecting the production of an essential commodity and causing seri ous unemployment amongst a section of the community the petitioner could hardly be expected to assume the burden of showing not that the company affairs were properly man aged for that is not his case but that there were also other companies similarly mismanaged for that is what according to the respondents he should prove in order to rebut the presumption of constitutionality and that inasmuch as there was no infringement of the individ ual right of a shareholder even assuming that there was an injury to the company as a corporate body the petitioner was not entitled to apply for relief under that article Whatever validity the argument may have in relation to the petitioner claim based on the alleged invasion of his right of property under article there can be little doubt that so far as his claim based on the contravention of article is concerned the petitioner is entitled to relief in his own right As has been pointed out already the impugned Act deprives the shareholders of the company of important rights and safeguards which are enjoyed by the shareholders of other joint stock companies in Indian under the Indian Companies Act The company which has its registered office within the State of Bombay and is governed by the provisions of the Indian Companies Act was incorporated with an authorised capital of Rs The petitioner states in his petition that he holds in his own right three ordinary shares and eighty prefercnce shares in the company though according to his own admission the preference shares do not stand in his name but have been registered in the name of <ORG> with which the shares are pledged The provisions of the Ordinance so far as they are material for our present purpose may be summarised as follows Under section of the Ordinance <ORG> may at any time by notified order appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be directors of the company for the purpose of taking over its management and administration and may appoint one of such directors to be the Chairman The powers and the duties of the directors are specified in section and this section inter alia empowers the directors to vary or cancel with the previous sanction of <ORG> any contract or agreement entered into between the company and any other person if they are satisfied that such contract or agreement is detrimental to the interests of the company The petitioner in his petition has challenged the con stitutional validity of both the Ordinance and the Act The provisions of the Act it is said amount to deprivation of property of the shareholders as well as of the company within the meaning of article of the Constitution and the restrictions imposed on the rights of the shareholders in respect to the shares held by them constitute an unjustifia ble interference with their rights to hold property and as such are void under article It is urged that there was no public purpose for which the <ORG> could authorise the taking possession or acquisition of property and such acquisition or taking of possession with out payment of compensation is in violation of the funda mental rights guaranteed by article of the Constitu tion The third and the material prayer is for issuing a writ of mandamus restraining the respondents to from exercising or purporting to exercise any powers under the said Ordinance or Act and from in any manner interfering with the manage ment or affairs of the company under colour of or any pur ported exercise of any powers under the Ordinance or the Act The other prayers are not material for our purpose The first point relates to the scope of our enquiry in the present case and raises the question as to what precisely are the matters that have to be inves tigated and determined on this application of the petition er Article of the Constitution guarantees to every body the right to move this court by appropriate proceed ing for enforcement of the fundamental rights which are enumerated in Part II of the Constitution Clause of the article lays down that <ORG> shall have the power to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this part Thus anybody who complains of infraction of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution is at liberty to move <ORG> for the enforcement of such rights and this court has been given the power to make orders and issuue directions or writs similar in nature to the prerogative writs of English law as might be considered appropriate in particular cases An incorporated company there fore can come up to this court for enforcement of its fundamental rights and so may the individual shareholders to enforce their own but it would not be open to an individual shareholder to complain of an Act which affects the funda mental rights of the company except to the extent that it constitutes an infraction of his own rights as well As the rights are different and inhere in different legal entities it is not competent to one person to seek to enforce the rights of another except where the law permits him to do so The rights that could be enforced under article must ordinarily be the rights of the petitioner himself who complains I of infraction of such rights and approaches the court for relief The first prayer made in the petition seeks relief in the shape of a declaration that the Act is invalid and is apparently inappropriate to an application under article while the second purports to be framed for a relief by way of injunc tion consequent upon the first As regards the third pray er it has been contended by Mr <NAME> who appears for one of the respondents that having regard to the nature of the case and the allegations made by the petitioner himself the prayer for a writ of mandamus in the form in which it has been made is not tenable What is argued is that a writ of mandamus can be prayed for for enforcement of statutory duties or to compel a person holding a public office to do or forbear from doing something which is incumbent upon him to do or forbear from doing under the provisions of any law There is no legal obligation on their part to abstain from exercising the powers conferred upon them by the impeached enact ment which the court can be called upon to enforce As the taking of possession is not for any public purpose and no provision for compensation has been made by the law which authorises it such law it is said violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under article of the Constitution The first clause of article lays down that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law The second clause provides No property movable or immovable including any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken posse sion of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given The other condition is that no property can be taken unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains a provision for payment of compensation in the manner laid down in the clause In the context in which the word acquisition appears in article it can only mean and refer to acquisition of the entire interest of the previous holder by transfer of title and I have no hesitation in holding that there is no such acquisition either as regards the property of the company or of the shareholders in the present case It is argued by the learned Attorney General that the taking of possession as contemplated by article means the taking of possession of the entire bundle of rights which the previous holder had by excluding him from every part or item thereof As regards the properties of the company the directors who have been given the custody of the property effects and actionable claims of the company are it is said to exercise their powers not in their own right but as agents of the company whose beneficial interest in all its assets has not been touched or taken away at all There can be no doubt that there is force in this con tention but as I have indicated at the outset we are not concerned in this case with the larger question as to how far the inter position of this statutory management and control amounts to taking possession of the property and assets belonging to the company The hold ing of the share in his name gives him the right to vote at the election of directors and thereby take a part though indirectly in the management of the company affairs If the majority of shareholders sides with him he can have a resolution passed which would be binding on the company and lastly he can institute proceedings for winding up of the company which may result in a distribution of the net assets among the shareholders The impugned Act has affected him in this way that his right of voting at the election of direc tors has been kept in abeyance so long as the management by the statutory director continues and as a result of that his right to participate in the management of the company has been abridged to that extent His rights to pass resolutions or to institute winding up proceedings have also been restricted though they are not wholly gone these rights can be exercised only with the consent or sanction of <ORG> If somebody had taken possession of the petitioner shares and was clothed with the authority to exercise all the powers which could be exercised by the holder of the shares under law then even if he purported to act as the petitioner agent and exer cise these powers for his benefit the possession of such person would not have been the petitioner possession if he was bound to act not under the directions of the petitioner or in obedience to his commands but under the directions of some other person or authority There is no doubt whatsoever that is not the position in the present case In the view that I have taken it is not necessary to discuss whether we can accept as sound the contention put forward by the learned Attorney General that the word property as used in article of the Constitution con notes the entire property that is to say the totality of the rights which the ownership of the object connotes It is difficult in my opinion to accept the contention formulated in such broad terms It is relevant to refer in this connection to an observation made by <NAME> in a <ORG> decision of <ORG> where the ques tion arose as to whether the taking of exclusive possession of a property for an indefinite period of time by the Com monwealth of Australia under Reg But there is nothing in See Minister of Stain for the Army <NAME> the placitum to suggest that the legislature was intended to be at liberty to free itself from the restrictive provisions of the placitum by taking care to seize something short of the whole bundle owned by the person whom it was expropriat ing During his reply however he laid some stress on clause of the article as well and his contention seems to be that there was deprivation of property in the present case in contra vention of the terms of this clause It has been argued by the learned Attorney General that clause of article relates to a power different from that dealt with under clause According to him what clause contemplates is confiscation or destruction of property in exercise of what are known as police powers in American law for which no payment of compensation is neces sary If the word deprived as used in clause connotes the idea of de struction or confiscation of property obviously no such thing has happened in the present case If the two clauses are read disjunctively the only question that may arise in connection with clause is whether or not the depriva tion of property is authorised by law Mr <NAME> has raised a question relating to the validity of the legislation on the ground of its not being covered by any of the items in the legislative list and to this question I would advert later on but apart from this clause of article of the Constitution seems to me to be altogether irrelevant for purposes of the petitioner case This leads me to the consideration of the next point raised by Mr <NAME> namely whether these restrictions offend against the provision of article of the Constitution Article of the Constitution enumerates the dif ferent forms of individual liberty the protection of which is guaranteed by the Constitution The remaining clauses of the article prescribe the limits that may be placed upon these liberties by law so that they may not conflict with public welfare or general morality Article guarantees to all citizens the right to acquire hold or dispose of property right to acquire hold or dispose of property within the meaning of article of the Constitution and secondly if they do interefere with such rights whether they are covered by the exceptions aid down in clause of the article So far as the first point is concerned it is quite clear that there is no restriction whatsoever upon the petitioner right to acquire and dispose of any property holder derives from the shares he holds is the dividend and there is no limitation on the petitioner right in this respect I do not think that there has been any restriction on the rights of a shareholder to hold acquire or dispose of his share by reason of the impugned enactment and conse quently article of the Constitution is of no assistance to the petitioner The next point urged on behalf of the petitioner raises an important question of constitutional law which turns upon the construction of article of the Constitution It is pointed out that the law in this case has selected one particular company and its shareholders and has taken away from them the right to manage their own affairs but the same treatment has not been meted out to all other companies or shareholders situated in an identical manner We have been referred in course of the arguments on this point by the learned Counsel on both sides to quite a number of cases decided by <ORG> where questions turning upon the construction of the equal protection clause in the Ameri can Constitution came up for consideration As the discriminatory treat ment has been in respect to the shareholders of this company alone any one of the shareholders whose interests are thus vitally affected has a right to complain and it is immate rial that there has been nodiscrimination inter se amongst the shareholders themselves It must be admitted that the guarantee against the denial of equal protection of the laws does not mean that identically the same rules of law should be made applicable to all persons within the territory of India in spite of differences of circumstances and conditions As has been said by <ORG> equal protection of laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws and this means subjection to equal laws applying alike to all in the same situation It is an accepted doctrine of <ORG> and which seems to me to be well founded on principle that the presumption is favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a transgression of constitutional principles As was said by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> It must be presumed that a <ORG> understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds No allegations were made in the petition and no materials were placed before us to show as to whether there are other companies in India which come precisely under the same category as <ORG> and the reasons for imposing control upon the latter as mentioned in the preamble to the Ordinance are applicable to them as well Mr <NAME> argues that these are matters of common knowledge of which we should take judicial notice If there was any such statement the respondents could have placed before us the whole string of events that led up to the passing of this legislation If we are to take judi cial notice of the existence of similar other badly managed companies we must take notice also of the facts which appear in the parliamentary proceedings in connection with this legislation which leave been referred to by my learned brother <NAME> in his judgment and which would go to establish that the facts connected with this corporation are indeed exceptional and the discrimination that has been made can be supported on just and reasonable grounds I purpose ly refrain from alluding to these facts or basing my deci sion thereon as we had no opportunity of investigating them properly during the course of the hearing We should <ORG> New York bear in mind that a corporation which is engaged in produc tion of a commodity vitally essential to the community has a social character of its own and it must not be regarded as the concern primarily or only of those who invest their money in it But all these I must say are matters which require investigation on proper materials which we have not got before us in the present case In my opinion this argument has no substance <NAME> I have arrived at a conclusion different from that reached by the majority of this <ORG> I consider it proper out of my respect for the opinion of my learned colleagues to state the reasons for my conclusions in some detail Suffice it to say that the net result of the Ordinance was that the managing agents of the said company were dismissed the directors holding office at the time automatically vacated their office the Government was authorised to nominate directors the rights of the shareholders of this company were curtailed in that it was made unlawful for them to nominate or appoint any director no resolution passed by them could be given effect to without the sanction of the Government and no proceeding for winding up could be taken by them without such sanction and power was given to the Government to further modify the provisions of the Indian Companies Act in its application to the said company <NAME> who tried the suit held that the Ordinance was valid and dismissed the suit The validity of the Ordinance and the Act has been challenged before us on the following grounds i that it was not within the legislative competence a of the Gover nor General to promulgate the Ordinance or of the <ORG> to enact the Act and ii that the Ordinance and the Act infringe the fundamental rights of the shareholders as well as those of the said company and are therefore void and inoperative under article Sub section of that article guarantees the right to move this <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part of the Constitution Sub section empowers this <ORG> to issue directions or orders or writs including certain specified writs whichever may be appro priate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by that Part It does not appear to me however that there is any substance in this point for in my opinion entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act and the corresponding entry of the Union List set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitu tion clearly support these pieces of legislation as far as the question of legislative competency is concerned Re ii The fundamental rights said to have been in fringed are the right to acquire hold and dispose of property guaranteed to every citizen by Article and the right to property secured by article In <NAME> case pointed out that the rights conferred by article a to and would be available to the citizen until he was under article deprived of his life or personal liberty according to procedure established by law and that the right to property guaranteed by article would likewise continue until the owner was under article deprived of such property by authority of law No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property movable or immovable including any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorisingthe taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken posses sion of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or speci fies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given Article protects every person whether such person is a citizen or not Whether or not having regard to the language used in article a corpora tion can be called a citizen and as such entitled to the rights guaranteed under article it is quite clear that the corporation is protected by article for that article protects every person which expression certainly includes an artificial person Therefore it is reasonable to say that the word property must be given the same meaning in construing those two articles But there is nothing in the placi tum to suggest that the legislature was intended to be at liberty to free itself from the restrictive provisions of the placitum by taking care to seize something short of the whole bundle owned by the person whom it is expropriating In my judgment the question whether the Ordinance or the Act has deprived the shareholder of his property must depend for its answer on whether it has taken away the substantial bulk of the rights constituting his property In other words if the rights taken away by the Ordinance or the Act are such as would render the rights left un touched illusory and practically valueless then there can be no question that in effect and substance the property of the shareholder has been taken away by the Ordinance or the Act The right still pos sessed by the shareholder are the most important of the rights constituting his property although certain privi leges incidental to the ownership have been put in abeyance for the time being It is in my opinion impossible to say that the Ordinance or the Act has deprived the shareholder of his property in the sense in which that word is used in article and article Learned counsel for the petitioner however urges that the Ordinance and the Act have infringed the sharehold er right to property in that he has been deprived of his valuable right to elect directors to give directions by passing resolutions and in case of apprehension of loss to present a petition for the winding up of the company The right to vote for the election of directors the right to pass reso lutions and the right to present a petition for winding up are personal rights flowing from the ownership of the share and cannot by themselves and apart from the share be ac quired or disposed of or taken possession of as contemplated by those articles Assuming however that the fetters placed on these rights are tantamount to the taking away of the rights altogether there is nothing to indicate that the Ordinance or the Act has after taking away the rights from the shareholder vested them in the <ORG> or in any other person named by it so as to enable the <ORG> or any other person to exercise those rights of the shareholder The <ORG> undoubtedly appoints directors under the Act but such appointment is made in exercise of the the powers vested in the <ORG> by the Ordinance or the Act and not in exercise of the shareholder right There was therefore nothing to prevent <ORG> from amending the Companies Act or from passing a new law regulating the management of the company by providing that the directors instead of being elected by the shareholders should be appointed by the <ORG> It implies that a person may be deprived of his property by authority of law Article prohib its the acquisition or taking possession of property for a public purpose under any law unless such law provides for payment of compensation There appear to me to be two objections to this sug gestion This deprivation of property is different from acquisition or taking of possession of property which goes by the name of eminent domain in the American Law I am not prepared to adopt such construction for I do not feel pressed to do so by the language used in article I think clause enunciates the general principle that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law which put in a positive form implies that a person may be de prived of his property provided he is so deprived by au thority of law The effect of clause is that only certain kinds of deprivation of property namely those brought about by acquisition or taking possession of it will not be permissible under any law unless such law provides for payment of compensation As regards the company it is contended that the Ordi nance and the Act by empowering the <ORG> to dismiss the managing agent to discharge the directors elected by the shareholders and to appoint new directors have in effect authorised the <ORG> to take possession of the undertaking and assets of the company through the new directors appoint ed by it without paying any compensation and therefore such law is repugnant to article of our Constitution This argument however overlooks the fact that in order that the posses sion of the servant or agent may be juridically regarded as the possession of the master or principal the servant or agent must be obedient to and amenable to the directions of the master or principal If the master or principal has no hand in the appointment of the servant or agent or has no control over him or has no power to dismiss or discharge him as in this case the possession of such servant or agent can hardly in law be regarded as the possession of the company matter there is great force in the argument that the proper ty of the company has been taken possession of by the <ORG> through directors who have been appointed by the <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by the Ordinance and the Act and who are under the direction and control of the <ORG> and this has been done without payment of any compen sation Here there fore it may well be argued that the property of the company having been taken possession of by the <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by a law which does not provide for payment of any compensation the fundamental right of the company has in the eye of the law been infringed This however is a misapprehension for if the Act be void on account of its being unconstitutional the directors appointed by the shareholders have never in law been dis charged and are still in the eye of the law the directors of the company and there was nothing to prevent them from taking proceedings in the name of the company at their own risk as to costs It is well settled in the United States that no one but those whose rights are directly affected by a law can raise the question of the constitutionality of that law Nor does it make any difference that other persons who may be injured are persons of the same race or occupation In that case there was no allegation that anyone of the plaintiffs had ever travelled on anyone of the rail roans or had requested any accommodation in any of the sleeping cars or that such request was refused A white man sold his property in such a block to a Negro under a contract which provided that the purchaser should not be required to accept a deed unless he would have a right under the laws of the city to occupy the same as a residence Although the alleged denial of con stitutional rights involved only the rights of coloured persons and the vendor was a white person yet it was held that the vendor was directly affected because the <ORG> below in view of the Ordinance declined to enforce his contract and thereby directly affected his right to sell his property The question has been answered in the negative by <ORG> in <NAME> The State of Indi ana If such be the require ments of law in connection with the equal protection clause which corresponds to our article it appears to me to follow that only a person who is the owner of the property can raise the question of constitutionality under article of a law by which he is so deprived of his property If direct interest is necessary to permit a person to raise the question of constitutionality under article a direct interest in the property will I apprehend be necessary to entitle a person to challenge a law which is said to infringe the right to that property under article The proceedings for a writ in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus appear to be somewhat different for the rules governing those proceedings permit besides the person imprisoned any person provided he is not an utter strang er but is at least a friend or relation of the imprisoned person to apply for that particular writ He cannot complain of any infringement of his own rights as a shareholder because his property has not been acquired or taken possession of by the <ORG> although he has been deprived of his right to vote and to present a winding up petition by authority of law Nor can he complain of an infringement of the compa ny right to property because he is not in the eye of law the owner of the property in question and accordingly not directly interested in it In certain exceptional cases where the company property is injured by outsiders a shareholder may under the English law alter making all endeavours to induce the persons in charge of the affairs of the company to take steps file a suit on behalf of himself and other shareholders for redressing the wrong done to the company but that principle does not apply here for this is not a suit nor has it been shown that any attempt was made by the petitioner to induce the old directors to take steps nor do these proceedings purport to have been taken by the petitioner on behalf of himself and the other shareholders of the company The only other ground on which the Ordinance and the Act have been challenged is that they infringe the the fundamen tal rights guaranteed by article of the Constitution in <ORG> <NAME> means subjection to equal laws applying alike to all in the same situation The inhibition of the article that the <ORG> shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws was designed to protect all persons against legislative discrim ination amongst equals and to prevent any person or class of persons from being singled out as a special subject for discriminating and hostile legislation If law deals equally with all of a certain well defined class it is not obnoxious and it is not open to the charge of a denial of equal protection on the ground that it has no applica tion to other persons for the class for whom the law has been made is different from other persons and there fore there is no discrimination amongst equals Arbitrary selection it has been said cannot be justified by calling it classification In <NAME> <ORG> it was pointed out that there was a strong presumption that a legislature understood and correctly appreciated the needs of its own people that its laws were directed to problems made manifest by experience and that the discriminations were based upon adequate grounds It was also pointed out in that case that the burden was upon him who attacked a law for unconstitutionality The power to make regulations relating to trading corpo rations or the control or production of industries was a power which consistently with article could be exercised only generally or with reference to a class and not with reference to a single company or to shareholders of a single company The Act is also challenged on the same ground in paragraph of the petition It will be noticed that it is not a case of a shareholder complaining only about discrimination against the company or fighting the battle of the company but it is a case of a shareholder complaining of discrimination against himself and other shareholders of this company It is true that there is no complaint of discrimination inter se the share holders of this company but the complaint is that the share holders of this company taken as a unit have been discrim inated vis a vis the shareholders of other companies Therefore the question as to the right of the shareholder to question the validity of a law infringing the right of the company does not arise Here the shareholder is com plaining of the infringement of his own rights and if such infringement can be established I see no reason why the shareholder cannot come within article to vindicate his own rights To the charge of denial of equal protection of the laws the respondents in the affidavit of Sri <NAME> filed in opposition to the petition make the following reply With reference to paragraph of the petition I deny the soundness of the submissions that on or from the th January when the Constitution of India came into force the said Ordinance became void under article of the Constitution or that the provisions thereof were inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the said Constitution or for any of the other grounds mentioned in paragraph of the said petition In the whole of the affidavit in opposition there is no suggestion as to why the promulgation of the Ordinance or the passing of the Act was considered necessary at all or on what principle or basis either of them was founded It will be noticed that apart from these preambles there is no material whatever before us establishing or even suggesting that this company and its shareholders have in fact been guilty of any mismanagement or neglect I shall assume that it is permissible to make a law whereby all delinquent companies and their shareholders may be brought to book and all companies mismanaging their affairs and the shareholders of such companies may in the interest of the general public be deprived of their right to manage the affairs of their companies circumstances arise for the simple reason that here there has been no classification at all and in any case the basis of classification by its very nature is much wider and cannot in it application be limited only to this company and its shareholders and that being so there is no reason to throw on the petitioner the almost impossible burden of proving that there are other companies which are in fact precisely and in all particu lars similarly situated In any event the petitioner in my opinion may well claim to have discharged the onus of showing that this company and its shareholders have been singled out for discriminating treatment by showing that the Act on the face of it has adopted a basis of classifica tion which by its very nature cannot be exclusively ap plicable to this company and its shareholders but Which may be equally appplicable to other companies and their shareholders and has penalised this particular company and its shareholders leaving out other companms and their shareholders who may be equally guilty of the alleged vice of mismanagement and neglect of the type referred to in the preambles
