<NAME> The plaintiff <ORG> filed this suit against the defendant <ORG> for a permanent injunction against the defendant restraining it from selling in any manner its product under the brand name Curechlor or any other deceptively mark similar to the registered trade mark of the plaintiff Peclor with respect to the pharmaceutical preparation known as Chloramphenicol Along with the suit the plaintiff filed this application under Order Rules I and and Section of the Code of Civil Procedure with the same prayer for temporary injunction till the decision of the suit The case of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff has been selling the said product under the trade mark Reclor in India from the year to March through the instrumentality of its registered users <ORG> and <ORG> and that from March The Supreme <ORG> also on a comparison of the competing trade marks came to the conclusion that the trade mark Dropovit was not deceptively similar to the trade mark <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the defendant also cited a few English judgments relating to the cases of pharmaceutical preparations namely Re Bayer Products Lid Application AU These judgments deal with cases of pharmaceutical preparations and a similar view has been taken in all these judgments as was taken by the Supreme <ORG> in <NAME> case supra i that the question of deceptive similarity must be decided on the basis of class of goods to which the two trade marks applied We have to judge the case of the plaintiff on the principal as stated above There is also an addition of the letter after the letter of Reclor I do not agree with the submission of Mr <NAME> that there is a great similarity in the two marks phonetically as suggested by him that the letter cu which creates the distinction in the two marks phonetically may sometimes be spoken feebly or may not be quite audible to a person with whom an order is placed for the sale of Reclor It is also worth noting that that the name of the defendant company is <ORG> The defendant has filed its price list effective from July The supply of drugs specified in Schedule or Schedule to Registered Medical Practitioners Hospitals Dispensaries and Nursing Homes can also be made only against the signed order in writing which ha Sub rule of Rule says that persons dispensing a prescription containing a drug specified in Schedule like the drug in question shall comply with the requirements as detailed there under which also places a number of restrictions on the dispensing chemists for their sale to customers Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the plaintiff also cited a number of judgments in support of his contention that the trade mark Curechlor is deceptively similar to the trade mark Rector in respect of medicinal preparations It was pointed out that in the case of <ORG> <ORG> a photo copy of which judgment was placed on the record an order allowing a temporary injunction in favor of <ORG> plaintiff respondent restraining the defendant appellant from using the trade mark Kempsillin in respect of the medicinal preparation was affirmed A perusal of the judgment shows that the ratio to the decision in that case was that there was per cent phonetical similarity in the two names There is obviously a great similarity phonetically in both these marks In conclusion I find no merit in the application and the same is dismissed
