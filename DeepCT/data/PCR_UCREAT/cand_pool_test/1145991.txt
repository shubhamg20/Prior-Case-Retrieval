There was a preliminary decree for partition in that suit decreeing partition according to the shares to which each was entitled and <NAME> died after the preliminary decree in that partition suit As <NAME> died after the preliminary decree and as <NAME> was added as his legal representative and as the plaintiff had only a right to possession after the death of <NAME> apparently the title based on the will in respect of the acres cents was not and could not be put forward by the present plaintiff in that suit No of In due course there was a final decree in that partition suit in which the properties were divided and allotted to the various sharers in accordance with the directions contained in the preliminary decree That suit did not proceed to trial and there was a compromise decree in that suit on st September Ex The portion of the compromise relating to this matter is as follows That the plaintiff herein i <NAME> has no interest claim or right whatsoever regarding the properties belonging to the defendant under <NAME> will that the plaintiff herein and his heirs should not question this will possession of another third the plaintiff instituted the present suit on the basis of the will of <NAME> to recover possession of the rd share in No the other third was in the possession of the plaintiff as per the partition decree in No of The suit was dismissed by both the <ORG> on the ground that as the compromise relating to the suit property was outside the scope of the suit No of the compromise required registration and further that in any event the title of the plaintiff to recover the properties on the strength of the will of <NAME> was concluded by the decision in No of It is on the basis of this admission that the present suit was instituted by the plaintiff to recover possession of the property from the first defendant The view therefore of the <ORG> below that the implied decision in No of stands in the way of the plaintiff recovering possession of the one third share in No in the possession of the first defendant seems to me to be clearly wrong All that the clause says is that <NAME> agrees to treat the will as valid <NAME> definitely stated in it that he and his heirs would not question the will and that they had no interest in the properties The importance of the case before <ORG> however is that it approves an earlier decision of West in <NAME> <NAME> I Bom There it was stated we three persons and our heirs and representatives have no interest of any kind whatever The same view was also taken in <ORG> <NAME> In view of these decisions I am of opinion that the compromise decree does not require registration as it does not by itself declare or create any rights in the suit property in favour of the plaintiff The second appeal is allowed to this extent and the decrees of the <ORG> below will be modified by passing a decree in favour of the plaintiff for recovery of possession of that portion of No which was allotted to the first defendant as representing his one third share under the partition decree in No of and was described as item No in the schedule attached to the decree The plaintiff will be entitled also to a decree for Rs The plaintiff will be entitled to recover half costs in all the <ORG> from the first defendant
