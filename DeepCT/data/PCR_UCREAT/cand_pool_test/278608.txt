The question is whether the present appeal which is an appeal from a decision of the Recorder of Rangoon was filed within time or out of time and that depends upon whether it is or is not governed by Article in the second schedule of the Limitation Act The Act relating to the matter are these First the Burma <ORG> Act XVII of Chapter IV deals with <ORG> and Section in that chapter says There shall be no appeal from the decree or order of the Recorder passed in any original suit or proceeding where the amount or value of the subject matter does not exceed three thousand rupees but where the amount or value of the suit or proceeding in the Recorder Court exceeds three thousand rupees and is less than ten thousand rupees an appeal shall lie to <ORG> It applies in general terms to the whole of British India and therefore includes British Burma There is no doubt that the meaning is that if anything in the Code is found to conflict with anything in the Burma Courts Act the Code shall not prevail to override the inconsistent provisions in the Burma Courts Act so far as they are inconsistent Then comes Section which says Unless when otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force an appeal shall lie from the decrees or from any part of the decrees of the <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction to the <ORG> authorised to hear appeals from the decisions of those <ORG> That is a general provision not conflicting with any enactment in the Burma <ORG> Act or any other Act by which an appeal was excluded because that exclusion is expressly saved and not prescribing for Burma or any other part of British India to what Court any appeal shall lie but merely laying down the broad rule that where an appeal is not expressly excluded an appeal shall lie to whatever Court under the enactment in force may be the proper Court Now what is meant by an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code A particular appeal was given by the Burma Courts Act and the Burma Courts Act is still the only Act which prescribes to what Court this appeal shall lie The Limitation Act Schedule II Article when it speaks of the Civil Procedure Code is on the face of it speaking of a Code which relates to procedure and does not ordinarily deal with substantive rights and the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned It was there held that Article Schedule II of the Limitation Act does not apply to proceedings under Section or Section of the Burma <ORG>s Act Section gives power to the Judicial Commissioner who is we presume in such a case by reason of Section of the General Clauses Act a High <ORG> within the meaning of the Limitation Act under certain circumstances if in his discretion he thinks fit to do so to admit a second appeal To apply Article to such cases would be to use it not to restrict any rights given to the parties but to curtail a discretion given to the <ORG>
