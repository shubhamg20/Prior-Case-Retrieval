The trial court substantially decreed the suit HELD It could not be contended by the appellant that the respondent had no right to sue on the basis that the rights under the contract accrued under cl of the Governor General Order in favour of <ORG> in Pakistan Clause of the Governor General Order dealt with the contracts which formed the subject matter of of the Government of India Act that is with contracts made by or on behalf of the Secretary of State in <ORG> for the purposes of the Province of punjab before the Government of India Act was brought into force It has nothing to do with the contracts made by or on behalf of the Governor of Punjab under Government of India Act after March There was no settlement between the appellant and the respondent that the former should recover only of the amount due from the appellant There was only a proposal to the appellant for settlement of the claims of the respondent and the sellers but the appellant instead of unconditionally accepting the proposal made an alternative proposal with the result that there was no settlement between the parties The first appellant sold the said stock to persons in Delhi and the United Provinces now called Uttar Pradesh It is alleged in paragraph of the plaint that on July the appellants admitted their liability to pay the said amount They pleaded that all rights and liabilities under the agreement of have accrued in favour of <ORG> which forms part of Pakistan and the respondent has no right to sue They also pleaded that in the meeting held on July and between the representatives of the respondent and the first appellant it was admitted on behalf of the respondent that the first appellant was liable to pay only of the total amount from and on behalf of them there was in credit in favour of the first appellant a sum of Rs It is asserted in the written statement that nothing was due by the appellants The written statement denies that the appellants Nos and admitted their liability to pay any amount in the meeting held on July The trial court decreed the suit of the respondent for a sum of Rs Section enabled the Governor General to make Orders for dividing between the new Dominions and between the new Provinces rights and liabilities of the Governor General in <ORG> and the relevant Provinces which were to cease to exist It came into force at once The Order would have effect subject to any award that might be made by <ORG> Clause of the Order provided that there would be a general financial settlement between the two new Provinces West Punjab and East Punjab in regard to all assets and liabilities of the Undivided Punjab as they stood immediately before the appointed day It further provided that any award of the Arbitrator given under Cl or Cl of the Order would be taken into account in making general financial settlement Counsel has cited a number of cases in support of this argument Clauses and of the Governor order dealt with various contracts made by or on behalf of the Governor of Punjab in accordance with of the Government of India Act or rights and obligations of the Governor arising Under those contracts The phrase on behalf of the Province of Punjab in Cl of the Governor General Order shows that the contracts dealt with in that clause were the contracts which formed the subject matter of of the Government of India Act They did not overlap and there was no conflict between them The question that we are called upon to decide in this case was not considered in that case It is difficult to under stand how this remark helps the appellants on account of the construction that we are putting on the language of clause of the Governor General Order It was held that the liability to pay the amount was not a financial obligation contemplated by cl of the Governor General Order and the Government of West Bengal was liable under cl a of the said Order to pay the rent which had accrued upto August It is thus clear that the case was decided on the concession made by the Advocate General and the question that has arisen before us did not arise there In the judgment there is no reference to any Order made by the Governor of the Province of Bengal Secondly it is said that by virtue of a settlement between the <ORG> and the appellants the former can recover only of the amount found due by the latter The trial court and <ORG> have found that there was no settlement between the parties and we agree with them The so called settlement is spelt out by the appellants from <NAME> letters dated January The letter opens with the statement that the question of settlement of claims of <ORG> and all sellers against your agency has been discussed at length in the presence of certain <ORG> representatives and <NAME> the second appellant It may be noted that in paragraph of the written statement the appellants had taken the plea that the settlement of January It is not a pleading that there was a firm settlement between the parties There is plainly substantial difference between the terms proposed by the Director and the alternative term proposed by <NAME> In the result we are of opinion that there was no settlement between the parties This inference is supported by three letters sent to the appellants by the Director <ORG> the Controller of Food Accounts and the Director General <ORG> dated September November and September No argument founded on estoppel was advanced by the appellants in the trial court and <ORG> The argument is not raised even in the statement of case filed by the appellants in this Court While dealing with this argument the trial court said These letters and other letters on the file which have been referred to by the learned counsel for the defendants do show that the <ORG> had taken such a decision The argument is founded on the proceedings of the meeting held on July and in the office of the Controller <ORG> at Simla Thereafter he added that they have to settle all the accounts of all the sellers on whose behalf the Punjab <ORG> has recovered the money from the con signees and the amounts found due to different sellers as per <ORG> proceedings by making cash payment to <ORG> of the amount found short They were asked by him to bring the payees receipts with them in support of payments made to sellers <NAME> Secretary to the Governor has deposed that there was no legal liability of the <ORG> to pay sellers whose goods were supplied to the consignees through the sellers at Shahdara On the other hand letters of the Director <ORG> dated April and May show that the <ORG> was paying the sellers from the amount with it to the credit of the appellants and asking them to give their consent to such payment In each of them he has stated that if no reply were received within a fortnight it would be presumed that the appellants had agreed to the payment being made to the sellers mentioned in the letters He concluded by saying that if no reply was received by him up to May it would be presumed that they had no objection to the payment being made to the sellers and that this office would proceed to make payment to the parties concerned Accordingly we allow the appeal and dismiss the suit of the <ORG>
