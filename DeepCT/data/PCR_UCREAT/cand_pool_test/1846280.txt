The first civil revision petition raises a question in regard to the scope and effect of Order Rule Civil The suit was filed by the plaintiff in <ORG> for a declaration that he was a duly elected member of <ORG> When the meeting commenced there were members present besides the president It is alleged that the adjournment was illegal because out of the members who voted for the adjournment two members had ceased to be so long before the date and they had no right to take part in the meeting at all and as such their votes were improperly received In the plaint there are allegations impeaching the conduct of the President of <ORG> and questioning the legality of the notification in the <ORG> published by the <ORG> But there is not a single allegation made either against defendant or The application of the <ORG> was opposed both by the plaintiff and the defendants The local Government has power under Section to make rules with reference to all matters relating to elections of members of <ORG> If there are more candidates than there are vacancies the votes of the members present at the meeting shall be taken The manner has been prescribed by Section to which I have already referred There are several sections in the Act vesting in the <ORG> power of control over <ORG> It empowers the Local <ORG> inter alia to suspend by order in writing the execution of any resolution of any Local <ORG> Presumably it was under this section that the Government acted when it issued the notification to which the plaintiff takes exception in his plaint Under Section I have pointed out that <ORG> may suspend the execution of any resolution of <ORG> can it or can it not veto the election of a member under this section It is at a meeting that the candidate is to be elected In this case it has exercised that right and suspended the execution of the resolution The material portion of Rule runs thus The <ORG> may at any stage of the proceedings either upon or without the application of either party and on such terms as may appear to the <ORG> to be just order that the name of any person who ought to have been joined whether as plaintiff or defendant or whose presence before the <ORG> may be necessary in order to enable the <ORG> effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit be added I may quote his very words from the judgment The very basic principle of judgment interpartes is that the judgments are not judgements in rem but declaratory and operative only as between them This view seems to ignore the distinction which the section makes between two classes of persons Persons who ought to have been joined persons whose presence is necessary to enable the <ORG> to completely and effectively adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit The view taken in that case is opposed not only to the plain wording of the section but also to a large body of authority That was a decision on the Code of but in this respect there is no difference between that and the present code The plaintiff in that case sued defendant on a bond executed in his favour The latter supporting the statement made by defendant sought to intervene and the plaintiff resisted his application The learned Judges Sir <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> thus deal with the question Is the effectual adjudication mentioned in the section only as between the parties to the suit Or does the section contemplate a final decision as between not only them but also third parties interested in the dispute They state their answer in terms which leave no doubt on the paint Now as explained in the case of <NAME> <NAME> the <ORG> has the power to add a person as defendant even though the plaintiff objects to such joinder I may quote another paragraph from the judgment The object of the legislature is to avoid multiplicity of suits and to ensure that the dispute may be finally determined at the same time in the presence of all the parties interested without the delay and expense of several actions and trials Do the English cases give countenance to a different rule Montgomery <NAME> deals fully with the question The action was by a shipowner for a declaration that he is entitled to freight against the consignee of the goods who had no property in the cargo It was held that the shippers of the cargo who applied to be added as defendants are proper parties and that they should be added in order that they might counter claim against the plaintiffs damages for short delivery and injury to cargo The learned Master of the <NAME> explains that it was one of the great objects of the Judicature Acts that where there is one subject matter out of which several disputes arise all parties should be brought before the <ORG> and all disputes should be determined in one and the same action Esquimalt and <ORG> <NAME> A decided by <ORG> is another case which supports the view I am taking I reverse the order of the lower Court and direct that the <ORG> be added as defendant to the suit The plaintiff shall pay the costs of the petitioner in the lower Court and in this Court I make no order as to costs
