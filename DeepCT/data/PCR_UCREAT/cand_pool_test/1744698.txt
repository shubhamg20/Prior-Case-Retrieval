In order to understand the precise significance of the ground taken in this Rule it will be necessary to set out briefly the facts giving rise to the appeal the dismissal of which has led to the present application being made to us Thereafter the learned Munsif at the instance of the plaintiff filed a complaint if ore the Magistrate against the said petitioners <NAME> and <NAME> or having committed certain offences punishable under Sections and of the I This complaint was one which was marla under Section of the Criminal Thereafter an appeal was filed before the District Judge against the order of the Munsif making or filing the said complaint The hearing of the appeal was adjourned and it appears that the matter did not come on again before the District Judge till the nd December when it was thought desirable that the appeal which the appellants that is <NAME> and <NAME> had filed against the decree of the <NAME> in tli said suit should be heard along with the appeal against the order of the <NAME> filing or making the complaint under the provisions of Section of the Criminal The hearing of this appeal that is to say the appeal against the order of the <NAME> filing or making the complaint was accordingly a learned The District Judge after looking into the record found that the hearing by the Magistrate of the complaint made by the <NAME> had been delayed for more than a year he came to the conclusion that no further time could be allowed and he thereupon dismissed the appeal Mr <NAME> who appears for the <ORG> argues that by the terms of Section the appeal against the order of the Munsif filing or making the complaint under Section of the Criminal lay to the <ORG> to which the <ORG> making the order or filing the complaint was subordinate within the meaning of Section in other words Mr <NAME> contention is that the appeal from the order of the Munsif making or filing the complaint lay to the District Judge and the appeal was one which was governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and not by the Coda of Criminal Procedure Mr <NAME> who appears in support of the Rule argues that the appeal is one which is allowed by and under a section of the Code of Criminal Procedure namely section and that there is nothing whatsoever in the Code of Criminal Procedure negativing the contention that the appeal is governed by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure In the second place he argues that the Coda of Civil Procedure has no application and that having regard to Chapter of the Code of Criminal Procedure it must follow that the appeal is one governed by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if that is so then under Section of the Criminal the learned Judge who disposed of the appeal was in error in disposing of the same without considering the matters on the record in the appeal No doubt the appeal in this case is one which is given by Section of the Criminal but the very words used in Section of the Criminal indicate with sufficient clearness that the <ORG> to which the appeal lies is one to which the <ORG> making or filing the complaint is subordinate in other words if it is <ORG> which has made an order under Section of the Criminal the appeal against such an order must lie to and be heard by the authority or tribunal to which such civil <ORG> is subordinate It follows therefore that the original order having been made by a <ORG> in a civil suit the appeal against an order by the <ORG> under Section of the Criminal lay to the District Judge to whom the <ORG> was subordinate It follows therefore that the procedure governing an appeal of this description is one which is to be sought for within the four corners of the Code of Civil Procedure It stood over from time to time till it was reached on the nd June It stood over for a further period and was not reached till the th December when as stated above the learned pleaders who had bean engaged to appear in support of the appeal were found to be absent The result therefore is that there is absolutely no substance in the present Rule and it must be discharged
