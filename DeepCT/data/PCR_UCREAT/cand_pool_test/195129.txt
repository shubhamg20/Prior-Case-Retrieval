PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT KHUBCHAND BAGHEL AND OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> RAJAGOPALA BENCH <NAME> RAJAGOPALA SINHA BHUVNESHWAR CJ <NAME> <NAME> RAGHUBAR <NAME> CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC RF SC RF SC ACT Election Appeal to <ORG> under A Whether in computing period of limitation for filing an appeal to <ORG> time provided by of Limitation Act for getting a copy of the order can be excluded Whether a applied to cases of appeal preferred under A Relationship between the two limbs of of Limitation Act Limitation Act ss First Schedule Art Representation of the People Act A Against the order of the <ORG> the first respondent preferred an appeal to the <ORG> under A of the Representation of the People Act Admittedly the appeal was filed more than days after the order of <ORG> If the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the order of the <ORG> was excluded the appeal was filed within days The appellant came to this <ORG> by special leave ii Though the right of appeal is conferred by A of the Representation of the People Act and it is by virtue thereof that the appeal was filed by respondent in the <ORG> it is still an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure to the <ORG> of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act it is not necessary for an appeal to be an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure that the right to prefer the appeal should be conferred by the Code of Civil Procedure There is no reason for construing the words under the Code of Civil Procedure as meaning governed in the matter of procedure by the Code of Civil Procedure Section a of the Limitation Act speaks of express exclusion and there is no express exclusion in A of the Representation of the People Act An order made under of the Representation of the People Act if it contains also the reasons for it is a composite document satisfying the definition of a judgment as well as that of an order and thereby attracting the relevant provisions of of the Limitation Act The Act of empowers the <ORG> to make an order and gives a right of appeal against that order to the <ORG> and therefore is directly attracted without any recourse to the definition of an order in the Code of Civil Procedure The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> behalf of the Chief Justice and himself We have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of our brother <NAME> and we agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed The facts of the case have been set out in detail in the judgment of <NAME> and it is therefore unnecessary to repeat them There were three principal points that were urged before us on either side which require to be considered and all of them turn on the proper construction of of the Indian Limitation Act which we shall for convenience set out here Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in section sections to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply and there is a difference between the two periods For this purpose he relied on Art The argument was that though the right of appeal in the case before us was conferred by A of the Representation of the People Act and it was by virtue thereof that the appeal was filed by the respondent to <ORG> it was still an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure to <ORG> that the right to prefer the appeal should be conferred by the Code of Civil Procedure but that it was sufficient if the procedure for the filing of the appeal and the powers of the court for dealing with the appeal were governed by that Code The right to prefer these appeals was conferred by <ORG> constituting the respective High <ORG>s and not by the Code of Civil Procedure though the Code of Civil Procedure governed the procedure jurisdiction and powers of the <ORG> in dealing with the appeals so filed There would have been need therefore to except cases covered by Art Mr <NAME> drew our attention to some decisions in which a different construction was adopted of the word under a particular enactment occurring in other Articles of the Limitation Act and in particular some dealing with appeals in certain criminal matters <ORG> shall subject to the provisions of this Act have the same powers jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to an appeal under this Chapter as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate juris diction In this view even on the narrowest construction of the words different from those prescribed therefor in first schedule occurring the opening part of the exclusion of time provided for by Art of the Limitation Act would be permissible in computing the period of limitation for filing the appeal to <ORG> in the case before us Sub section it would be seen consists of two parts The first sets out the conditions to which the special law should conform in order to attract section and that part ends with the words as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule This is followed by the conjunction and that word by the second part reading for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in section sections to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply If on the other hand the two parts of the sub section could be read independently as if they made provision for two separate situations the result would be that the words starting from for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law followed by clauses a would be an independent provi sion unrelated to the first part and therefore could operate unhampered by the condition set out in the first part In other words if the latter construction were adopted for every suit appeal or application for which a period of limitation was prescribed by a special or local law the provisions in ss to would apply unless excluded Mr <NAME> urged that the conjunction and could in the context be construed only as rendering the second limb a part and parcel of the first so that unless the conditions laid down by the opening words of the sub section were satisfied the provisions of the Limitation Act set out in cl a would not be attracted to determine the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law If the conditions prescribed by the opening words were satisfied of the Limitation Act would be attracted Section reads Subject to the provisions contained in sections to inclusive every suit instituted appeal preferred and application made after the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the first schedule shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence In other words if the special or local law prescribed a period of limitation different from that prescribed by the first schedule by the application of the first part of sub the court is enabled to dismiss suits appeals and applications filed beyond time The words italicised being perfectly general would manifestly be comprehensive to include every special or local law and among these must necessarily be included such special or local laws which satisfy the conditions specified by the first limb of We then have this strange result that by the operation of the first part ss to of the Limitation Act are made applicable to that class of special and local laws which satisfy the conditions specified by the first limb whereas by the operation of the second limb the provisions of section to to to would not apply to the same class of cases A construction which would lead to this anomalous result cannot be accepted and we therefore hold that subject to the construction we have put upon sub of both the parts are to be read as one whole and that the words following the conjunction and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation etc We agree that the appeal fails and we direct that it be dismissed with costs The facts relevant to the question raised lie in a small compass and they are not disputed On February the first respondent preferred an appeal against the said order of <ORG> to <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur If the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the order of the <ORG> was excluded the appeal was filed within days but if in law it could not be excluded the appeal would certainly be out of time The present appeal has been preferred by the appellant against the said order of <ORG> setting aside his election Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant in an ela borate argument placed before us the different aspects of the question raised and I shall deal with his argument in the appropriate context in the course of my judgment At the conclusion of the trial of an election petition the <ORG> shall make an order a dismissing the election petition or declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void or Section A An appeal shall lie from every order made by a <ORG> under section or section to <ORG> in which the <ORG> is situated The High Court shall subject to the provisions of this Act have the same powers jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to an appeal under this Chapter as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate jurisdiction Every appeal under this Chapter shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the order of the <ORG> under section or section Provided that <ORG> may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satis fied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First Schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in section section to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal an application for leave to appeal and an application for a review of judgment the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced and time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree sentence or order appealed from or sought to be reviewed shall be excluded Section A of the Act confers a right of appeal against an order of the <ORG> under or thereof sub thereof prescribes a period of limitation of days for preferring such an appeal Section of the Limitation Act attracts by fiction the provisions of thereof to an appeal described in of the said Act with the result the provisions of sub ss This argument is met by learned counsel for the respondents in two ways namely i that the First Schedule to the Limitation Act has prescribed a period of limitation for such an appeal and ii that sub will apply even to a case where the First Schedule to the Limitation Act has not prescribed any period of limitation for an appeal but a special law prescribed a period of limitation for such an appeal Section of the Civil Procedure Code of which was in force at that time read Unless when otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force an appeal shall lie from the decrees or from any part of the decrees of the <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction to the <ORG> authorized to hear appeals from the decisions of those <ORG> when it speaks of the Civil Pro cedure Code is on the face of it speaking of a Code which relates to procedure and does not ordinarily deal with substantive rights and the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned No direct decision has been brought to our notice which has differed from or even questioned the correctness of this decision Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant brought to our notice a number of decisions which considered the forum to which an appeal shall lie against an order under of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the procedure to be followed therein It is said that the combined effect of these decisions is that the procedure applicable in an appeal against an order made by a civil court under of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure whereas the period of limitation is that prescribed for an appeal under the Code of Criminal Procedure The complainant preferred an appeal to the District Judge more than days prescribed under art Even so it is contended that under A of the Act <ORG> though it has the same powers jurisdiction and authority of an appellate court governed by the Code of Civil Procedure is not empowered to follow the procedure prescribed under the Code in respect of receiving the appeals Under that sub section <ORG> shall subject to the provisions of this Act have the same powers jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to an appeal under this Chapter as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate jurisdiction Under the second part of sub of A of the Act a fiction is created namely that though a right of appeal is conferred by A of the Act the appeal thereunder for the purpose of sub will be deemed to be an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil apPellate jurisdiction If that part was excluded how could the appeal be received in <ORG> The answer given is that the Government might make rules under of the Act When confers a statutory power on <ORG> to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure we cannot invoke the general power of <ORG> to make rules under of the Act of Schedule to the Limitation Act did not prescribe a period of limitation for the kind of appeal under consideration the question arises whether sub of of the Limitation Act would not be appli cable if no period was prescribed by the First Schedule for an appeal created by a special law but the special law pres cribed a period of limitation for the same Section of that Act which is relevant to the present inquiry read When by any law not mentioned in the schedule hereto annexed and now or hereafter to be in force in any part of British India a period of limitation differing from that prescribed by this Act is especially prescribed for any suits appeals or applications nothing herein contained shall affect such law Section of this Act read When by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India a period of limitation is especially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed Before the amendment of there was a difference of view on the following questions namely whether the general provisions of the Limitation Act where the word prescribed alone without reference to any Act was used or even where that word was not used would be applicable to special or local laws and whether the general provisions of the Limitation Act did not apply at all to the periods of limitation prescribed by special or local laws A comparison of the phraseology of the earlier sections shows that while of the Limitation Act of used the words shorter period of the Act of used the expression differing and of the Acts of and removed both the expressions The result was that of the Act of saved all the special or local laws which prescribed a special period of limitation from the operation of the provisions of the Limitation Act As the section then stood it applied to all special or local laws prescribing a period of limitation whether the Limitation Act prescribed any period of limitation or not for suits or appeals similar to those governed by special or local laws or where the period of limitation so prescribed by special or local laws was shorter or longer than that prescribed in the Limitation Act Can it be said that by the Amending Act of a conscious departure was made by the <ORG> to impose a condition for the application of sub of namely that a period of limitation should have been expressly prescribed by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act in respect of a suit or appeal governed by the special or local law There was no occasion for such a departure It follows that there is no period of limitation for an appeal not provided for in the second division unless the special or local law prescribes for it When the First Schedule of the Limitation Act prescribes no time limit for a particular appeal but the special law prescribes a time limit to it can it not be said that under the First Schedule of the Limitation Act an appeal can be filed at any time but the special law by limiting it provides for a different period While the former permits the filing of an appeal at any time the latter limits it to the prescribed period If the first Schedule to the Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act We are conscious of the fact that the language used by the <ORG> is perhaps not very happy but we must put upon it a construction which will reconcile the various difficulties caused by the other sections of the Limitation Act and which will give effect to the object which obviously the <ORG> had in mind because if we were to give to the meaning which Mr <NAME> contends for then the result would be that even of the Limitation Act would not apply to this special law The learned Judges expressed conflicting views <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> stated thus A special law may provide a period of limitation and schedule I may omit to do so But this <ORG> held that of the Limitation Act applied but that section excluded the application of to the said application <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed Hence it may be said that there is no limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act for an A I appeal against an order of acquittal at the instance of a private prosecutor Thus there is a difference between the Limitation Act and the rule laid down in of the Code in respect of limitation affecting such an application This observation clearly supports the position that would apply even to a case where a difference between the special law and the Limitation Act arose by the omission to provide for a limitation to a particular proceeding under the Limitation Act therefore hold that in the instant case the Act provides a period of limitation different from that prescribed therefor by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act and therefore it is governed by of the said Act Even if my view on the construction of the first limb of of the Limitation Act were wrong it would not help the appellant for his case squarely falls within the scope of the second limb of the section and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or focal law Those proceedings to which the first part applies by fiction the period prescribed in the special or local law is treated as prescribed in the First Schedule itself A construction which will leave without effect any part of the language of a statute will normally be rejected or to put it in a positive form the <ORG> shall ordinarily give meaning to every word used in the section Does the conjunction and make the following clause a limitation on the preceding one No rule of grammatical construction has been brought to our notice which requires an interpretation that if sentences complete by themselves are connected by a conjunction the second sentence must be held to limit the scope of the first sentence But if the interpretation suggested by the learned counsel be accepted we would not be giving any meaning at all to the word any used thrice in the second part of the section namely any period any suit and any special or local law There is no reason why we should attribute such a grammatical deficiency to the legislature when every word in the second part of the section can be given full and satisfactory meaning Provided that <ORG> may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period There are two answers to this argument Firstly a of the Limitation Act speaks of express exclusion but there is no express exclusion in sub of A of the Act secondly the proviso from which an implied exclusion is sought to be drawn does not lead to any such necessary implication Elaborating the argument it is said that in order to exclude the time for obtaining a copy of the order appealed against the original shall be a decree or order within the meaning of or judgment within the meaning of of the Limitation Act and the order under of the Act is neither a decree nor an order or a judgment within the meaning of the said sub sections of of the Limitation Act Under sub of of the Code of Civil Procedure judgment is defined to mean the statement given by the judge of the grounds of a decree or order Section of the said Code says An appeal shall lie from the following orders and save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any law for the time being in force from no other orders Under of the Code The procedure provided in this Code in regard to suits shall be followed as far as it can be made applicable in all proceedings in any court of civil jurisdiction Judgment is a statement given by the judge of his grounds in respect of a decree or order Under sub thereof an appeal shall lie from every order made by a <ORG> under or to <ORG> of the State in which the <ORG> is situated As under of the Act the Election <ORG> is directed to try election petitions as nearly as may be in accordance with the pro cedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure it is the duty of the Election <ORG> to give a statement of reasons for its decision If so it is manifest that an order made under of the Act if it contains also the reasons for it is a composite document satisfying the definition of a judgment as well as that of an order and thereby attracting the relevant provisions of of the Limitation Act The proviso to a of the Representation of the People Act gives discretion to <ORG> to entertain an appeal presented after the expiry of days from the date of the order of the <ORG> in case it is satisfied that there is sufficient cause for the late presentation of the memorandum of appeal The respondent has applied in this Court for the condonation of the delay in filing the appeal in <ORG> There was a difference of opinion in <ORG>s regarding the applicability of of the Limitation Act to such appeals The Election <ORG> passed the order on January and the appeal was filed on February I am satisfied that there was sufficient cause for the respondent not presenting the appeal within the period of limitation <NAME> agree with my brother <NAME> that the appeal should be dismissed I regret my inability to agree with all the reasons which he has given I need not recapitulate the facts which have been set out fully in the judgment prepared by my learned brother but I would only state the point which we have to consider in this appeal Finally it was argued that even if the appeal cannot be regarded as one falling within the first limb of sub of would still apply because the second limb of sub of is wide enough in its ambit to include a suit appeal or application for which no period of limitation is prescribed in the first schedule but a period of limitation has been prescribed by a special or local law As however I do not agree with what he has said on the first two points I must briefly indicate my reasons for coming to different conclusions Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which was in force at that time read thus Unless when otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force an appeal shall lie from the decrees or from any part of the decrees of the <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction to the <ORG> authorised to hear appeals from the decisions of those courts when it speaks of the Civil Procedure Code is on the face of it speaking of a Code which relates to procedure and does not ordinarily deal with substantive rights and the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned With respect I do not think that there was any warrant for holding that an appeal which was not given by the Code would still be one under the Code merely because the procedural provisions thereof would govern its course I see no valid reason for construing the words under the Code of Civil Procedure as meaning governed in the matter of procedure by the Code of Civil Procedure By reading the article in the way it has done <ORG> has virtually construed the only provision in the Limitation Act dealing with normal civil appeals to <ORG> as a residuary article which would take in all appeals by whatever law they may be provided merely because the procedure relating to appeals contained in the Code of Civil Procedure was applicable to them Indeed while a right to institute a suit or make an application is a wider kind of right Article makes provision for applications for which no period of limitation is prescribed elsewhere in the Schedule In the second division however which deals with appeals there is no provision analogous to art or The <ORG> knew that appeals have been provided by various special laws but it made no provision for such appeals in this Schedule appa rently for the reason that a law which confers a right of appeal is expected to provide for the period of limitation for such an appeal XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure were not applicable to an appeal under the Representation of the People Act there would be no provision whereunder the party could at all file an appeal It seems to me however that there can be no difficulty at all in this matter as every High Court has made rules partly under the Constitution and partly in exercise of its inherent power to make suitable provisions in regard to this and allied matters There may be a great deal to be said in favour of not disturbing even erroneous decisions affecting substantive rights to property which have stood undisturbed for a long time on the ground that such a course may unsettle existing titles to property They run thus Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First Schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the Provisions contained in section Since I agree with my learned brother about what he has said regarding the second limb of sub of the aapeal must be dismissed with costs as proposed by him
