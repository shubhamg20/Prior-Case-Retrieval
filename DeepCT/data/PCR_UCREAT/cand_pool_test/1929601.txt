HEADNOTE The petitioner aggrieved by the award of a contract by the respondent in favour of <ORG> filed a Writ Petition and a further Writ Appeal in the Karnataka High <ORG> The single judge of the High <ORG> had taken the view that prerequisites for the supply of tender forms were contained in Para I of the Notification Inviting Tender NIT and the details called for in Para could be supplied any time <ORG> on appeal did not express any opinion regarding the requirements set out in para but was of the view that there was nothing unfair or arbitrary about the award of the contract to the <ORG> Dismissing the appeal of the petitioner the <ORG> HELD Para cannot but be read with para I The supply of some of the documents referred to in para is indispens able to assess whether the applicant fulfills the prequali fying requirements set out in para I It will be too extreme to hold that the omission to supply every small detail referred to in para would affect the eligibility under para I and disqualify the tenderer We have heard counsel for both sides at length We grant Special leave and proceed to dispose of the appeal Though at an earlier stage of the proceedings there were some allegations of favoritism the plea of the peti tioner as urged before us is that the <ORG> should not at all have entertained the tender of <ORG> as the <ORG> did not fulfill certain preliminary requirements which under the Notification Inviting Tenders I had to be ful filled even before the forms of tender could be supplied to any intending contractor The principal argument advanced on behalf of the peti tioner is that paragraphs I and of the <ORG> specified certain pre qualifying requirements It is submit ted that <ORG> did not comply with these requirements and hence its application for tender forms should have been rejected at the outset He took the view that the pre requisites for supply of tender forms were only the three conditions set out in para I of the I and that the details called for in para could be supplied at any time <ORG> on appeal did not express any clear opinion as to the nature of the requirements set out in Para but was satisfied on an overall view that there was nothing unfair or arbitrary about the award of the contract tO the <ORG> It observed We have carefully considered these contentions Why we are obliged to say this is if the <ORG> is satisfied there is nothing arbitrary or unfair in the award of the contract it cannot convert itself into a super technical Committee and find out whether the requirements have been fulfilled or not If these basic principles are kept in mind we do not think we can intro duce nuances of law to enter into the realm of contract which we consider should be kept out of the purview of writ jurisdiction The first question that falls to be considered is as to whether there is any difference between the requirements in paras I and and whether only para I and not para sets out the pre conditions of eligibility to submit a tender for the contract It is in order to satisfy itself that the requirements of para I and are fulfilled that the calls for the certifi cates mentioned in para and the fulfilment of the require ment in para I has obviously to be verified by reference to the audited balance sheets called for under clause a of para The reference in clause of para to the annual output of the works of the above nature is also obviously a reference to the works of the nature described in para I It is clear that at least some if not all of the documents referred to in para are intended to verify the fulfilment of the three prequalifying requirements of para I The stipulation of the time element within which the information asked for in para should be supplied is also of some significance it specifically requires the information to be supplied along with the application for tender forms The more harmonious and practical way of construing the I is by saying that before the tender books can be supplied an intending ten derer should satisfy the by supplying such of the documents called for in para as are material in assessing the fulfilment of the condition in para I that he fulfills the three conditions set out in para I It seems clear to us that apart from para I there are some other requirements in the I which have to be complied with before the applicant can be eligible for supply of tender forms It is pointed out incidentally that this is also a part of the specific requirements in para I and as such the <ORG> cannot be said to have satisfied the preliminary conditions Tendering it eligible to tender for the contract Should the <ORG> have been denied altogether the right to Tender for the contract consequent on the delay in sub mitting this document is the second question that arises for consideration <NAME> for the appellant would have us answer this question in the affirmative on the principle enunciated by <NAME> and approved by this Court in <NAME> <ORG> Second series where the learned Judge said An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged Accordingly if dismissal from employment is based on a defined procedure even though generous beyond the require ments that bind such agency that procedure must be scrupu lously observed He that takes the procedur al sword shall perish with the sword Even in England the recent trend in administrative law is in that direction as is evident from what is stated at pages in Prof There is no reason why we should hesitate to adopt this rule as a part of our continually expanding administrative law Where prequalifying conditions are notified in the notification the applications for the issue of tenders is carefully scrutinised with reference to these requirements and the tenders will be issued to those who comply with all the prequalifying eligibility requirements The tenders will be issued to those tenderers who comply with the prequalifying conditions The second is the record of minutes showing what they actu ally did There was extended discussion on the issue There was a discussion as to whether the stipulations mentioned in the <ORG> other than those stipulated under prequalifying conditions have to be mandatorily fulfilled before the tenders were filed However it was decided that in future it should be made clear that only prequalifying conditions would be mandatory These two documents particularly the last sentence of the second one clearly show <NAME> urged that the <ORG> had relaxed its I standards in favour of the <ORG> Interesting as this argument is we do not see much force in it In the first place although as we have ex plained above para cannot but be read with para I and that the supply of some of the documents referred to in para is indispensable to assess whether the applicant fulfills the prequalifying requirements set out in para I it will be too extreme to hold that the omission to supply every small detail referred in para would affect the eligibility under para I and disqualify the tenderer The question how far the delayed supply or omission to supply any one or more of the details referred to therein will affect any of the prequalifying conditions is a matter which it is for the <ORG> to assess regarding output of concrete and brick work had been supplied in time The delay was only in supplying the details regarding hollow cement blocks and to what extent this lacuna effected the conditions in para I was for the <ORG> to assess There is nothing wrong with this particularly as this document was eventually supplied Secondly whatever may be the interpretation that a court may place on the I the way in which the tender documents issued by it has been understood and implemented by the <ORG> is explained in its note which sets out the general procedure which the <ORG> was following in regard to I issued by it from time to time Para of the note makes it clear that the <ORG> took the view that para I alone incorporated the minimum prequalifying eligi bility conditions and the data called for under para was in the nature general requirements It further clarifies that while tenders will be issued only to those who comply with the prequalifying conditions any deficiency in the general requirements will not disqualify the applicant from receiving tender documents and that data regarding these requirements could be supplied later Right or wrong this was the way they had understood the standard stipulations and on the basis of which it had processed the applications for contracts all along They only decided in view of the contentions raised by the appellant that para should also be treated as part of the prequali fying conditions that they would make it specific and clear in their future I that only the fulfilment of prequal ifying conditions would be mandatory If a party has been consistently and bona fide interpreting the standards pre scribed by it in a particular manner we do not think this Court should interfere though it may be inclined to read or construe the conditions differently Thirdly the conditions and stipulations in a tender notice like this have two types of consequences The first is that the party issuing the tender has the right to punc tiliously and rigidly enforce them Thus if a party does not strictly comply with the requirements of paras III or VI of the I it is open to the <ORG> to decline to consider the party for the contract and if a party comes to <ORG> saying that the <ORG> should be stopped from doing so the <ORG> will decline relief by this <ORG> in earlier decisions is not that the <ORG> cannot deviate from these guidelines at all in any situation but that any deviation if made should not result in arbitrariness or discrimination It may perhaps be said to cause prejudice also to a party which can show that it had refrained from applying for the tender documents only because it thought it would not be able to produce the document by the time stipulated but would have applied had it known that the rule was likely to be relaxed But we are inclined to agree with the respondent contention that while the rule in <NAME> case supra will be readily applied by <ORG>s to a case where a person complains that a departure from the qualifi cations has kept him out of the race injustice is less apparent where the attempt of the applicant before <ORG> is only to gain immunity from competition But we make no order as to costs
