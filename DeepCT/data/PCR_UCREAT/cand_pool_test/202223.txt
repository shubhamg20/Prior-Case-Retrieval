In one group of lands declarations that the provisions of A shall not apply in respect of the lands were issued under With respect to a third group no notification under was issued but after the petitioners filed objections the notifica tion was issued accompanied by the declaration of urgency under The owners of the land sought to have the proceedings quashed on the grounds that there was no public pur pose and that there was no urgency justifying the notification under and dispensing with the enquiry under A In the appeals by the <ORG> it was contended by the appellant <ORG> that the burden of proving that there was no urgency was on the owners of the The doctrine of onus of proof becomes unimportant when there is sufficient evidence before the <ORG> to enable it to reach a particular conclusion in favour of or against a party The mind of the officer or authority con cerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under A which has to be considered Even a technically correct recital in an order or notification stating that the conditions precedent to the exercise of a power have been fulfilled may not debar the <ORG> in a given case from considering the question whether in fact those conditions have been fulfilled And a fortiori the <ORG> may consider and decide whether the authority concerned has applied its mind to really relevant facts of a case with a view to determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of a power has been fulfilled If it appears upon an examination of the totality of facts in the case that the power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied at all to the real object on purpose of a power so that the result is that the exercise of power could only serve some other or collateral object the <ORG> will interfere <ORG> had however correctly stated the limited grounds on which even a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need to take action under of the Act can be challenged namely main fides no application of mind and total want of material on which the opinion is formed Therefore it is for the petitioner to substantiate the grounds of his challenge under ss and petitioner has to either lead evidence or show that some evidence has come from the other side to indicate that his challenge to a notification or order is made good If he does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition will fail In the present case in addition to the bare assertions of the owners of the land that the particular urgency contem plated by did not exist there were other facts and circumstances including non disclosure of any facts and circumstances which could easily justify the use of and which could have been disclosed if they existed and therefore the petitioners should be held to have discharged their general onus under of the Evidence Act schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable at least summary inquiries under A of the Act to be completed without any impediment to the execution of the scheme ii All schemes relating to development of industrial and resi dential areas must be urgent in the context of the Yet the very nature of such schemes of development does not appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary enquiries under A iii There is no indication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> that the mind of the Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under A The recitals in the notification on the contrary indicate that elimination of the enquiry under A was treated as an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other matters The recital does not say at all that any opinion was formed on the need to dispense with the enquiry under A The burden therefore rested upon the <ORG> to remove the defect if possible in recitals by evidence to show that some exceptional circumstances existed which necessi tated the elimination of an enquiry under A and that the mind of the Commissioner was applied to this essential question <ORG> has thus correctly applied the provi sions of of the Evidence Act to place the burden upon the <ORG> to prove those special circumstances although the High <ORG> was not quite correct in stating that some part of the initial burden of the petitioners under ss and of the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the <ORG> to discharge its duty under of the Act The correct way of putting it would have been to say that the failure of the <ORG> to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under of the Evidence Act taken together with other evidence and the attendant facts and circumstances including the contents of recitals had enabled the petitioners to discharge their burdens under ss and Of the Evidence Act in these particular cases ARGUMENTS For the Appellant It was urged on behalf of the appellant <ORG> that the High <ORG> was in error in placing the burden of proof on the <ORG> Reliance was placed on the decision of the Su preme <ORG> in pages and In particular it was urged that where a statute prescribes something as a condition precedent for the exercise of statutory power and there is a recital of existence of that condition in the notification then it is presumed that the statutory condition exists and it is for the other side to bring material before the <ORG> to show that recital is not supported on any evidence or is made malafide The Barium Chemicals case and other cases cited can be easily distinguished on the ground that the statutory re quirements for the exercise of particular power for example under section of the Companies Act are differently worded where certain circumstances are required to be present There specific allegations were made by the petitioners giving reasons as to why they challenged the notifications Secondly there are number of decisions of the Supreme <ORG> where the opinion which is to be formed on is held to be subjective satisfaction It is submitted under section and on one hand and the power under are two separate and independent powers which can be exercised at different stages of the Land Acquisition pro ceedings In the pleadings of the Respondents the writ petitioners it was urged at pages and of the record that in fact it is significant that in some cases the lands which are sought to be acquired for the same purpose vis a vis for development and utilisation of the land as industrial and residential area the urgency clause has not been applied It was further stated at page that the power under Section has been exercised in casual and light heart ed manner The said point was argued before the High <ORG> and the High <ORG> dealt with the same at pages to of the record It was further argued that the Government never applied its mind nor did it place before the High <ORG> any material to show that there was any urgency with respect to some of the lands and no urgency in respect to the others It is admitted that the lands in all these cases were acquired for the same purpose inter alia for the development and utilisa tion of the said lands as an industrial and residential area The cases cited by the Counsel for the <ORG> have no application since in those cases the petitioners could establish that the impugned notification was not bona fide In this case the respondent land owners had in their Writ Petitions specifically raised the question that the authority had not applied its mind and treated it light heartedly and the Notification was not bona fide The <ORG> however did not place any material before the <ORG> to show that the authority had applied its mind or there was any clue to the urgency From all these facts and circumstances the respondents argue that the notification under Section was not bonafide and the authority had not applied its mind and the High <ORG> was right in setting aside the said notification The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BEG There are nine appeals before us after certifi cation of fitness of the cases for appeals to this Court directed against orders governed by the same judgment of a Division Bench of <ORG> disposing of Writ Petitions relating to four groups of lands which were sought to be acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The noti fication goes on to state AND WHEREAS the Commissioner <ORG> is of the opinion that the said lands were waste or arable lands and their acquisition is urgently necessary he is further pleased to direct under sub section of Section of the said Act that the provisions Section A of the said Act shall not apply in respect of the said land Thereafter a notification was issued under section of the Act on th December followed by notices under Sec tion and the Act it was conceded by Counsel in the course of arguments on behalf of the <ORG> in <ORG> that the proceedings had become invalid This land was notified under section of the Act on th September followed by the notice under section sub ss With regard to the land in the fourth group a notifi cation under Section the Act took place on th Novem ber in substantially the same terms as those in the other three groups but there was no direction under sec tion of the Act Consequently the appellant filed his objection on th January The real question which has been argued before us is raised by the State of Maharashtra in its three appeals Nos to of against the view taken by <ORG> of <ORG> in its judgment dated th June The case of the State of Maharashtra is stated as fol lows in the affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition officer I deny the allegation that the urgency clause has been applied without any valid reason Without prejudice to this respect fully submit that as mentioned in the impugned Notifications the rd Respondent formed the opin ion that the said lands were urgently acquired for the public purposes mentioned therein and accord ingly he was pleased to so direct under the provi sions of Section of the Act It is significant that in the affidavit filed in reply to the assertions of peti tioners denying the existence of such urgency as to attract the provisions of section of the Act the position primarily taken up on behalf of the State of Maharashtra was that the existence of the urgency is not a justiciable matter at all left for determination by <ORG> After that there is a bare submission stating the alternative case that the rd respondent had formed the opinion that the said lands were urgently required for the public purpose mentioned therein remember that the mind of the officer or authority concerned has really to be directed towards formation of an opinion on the need to dispense with the inquiry under Section A of the Act Neverthe less that opinion has to be based upon some relevant mate rials in order to pass the test which <ORG> do impose <ORG> had put its point of view in the following words When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of an authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of a power the challenge to the formation of such opinion or to such satisfaction is limited in law to three points only It can be challenged firstly on the ground of malafides secondly on the ground that the authority which formed that opinion or which arrived at such satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on which it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction and third ly that the material on which it formed its opin ion or reached the satisfaction was so insuffi cient that no man could reasonably reach that conclusion So far as the third point is con cerned no <ORG> of law can as in an appeal consider that on the material placed before the authority the authority was justified in reaching its conclusion The <ORG> can interfere only in such cases where there was no material at all or the material was so insufficient that no man could have reasonably reached that conclusion In this case however there is no challenge on any of these three grounds In other words the dispute is whether it is the petitioner who has to bring the material before the <ORG> to support his contention that no urgency existed or whether once the peti tioner denied that any urgency existed it was incumbent upon the respondent to satisfy the <ORG> that there was material upon which the respondents could reach the opinion as mentioned in section On the evidence before it <ORG> recorded its conclusions as follows In the case before us the petitioner has stated in the petition more than once that the urgency clause had been applied without any valid reason The urgency clause in respect of each of the said two notifications concerning the lands groups Nos and is contained in the relative section notification itself The public purpose stated in the notification is for development and utiliza tion of the said lands as an industrial and resi dential area To start with this statement itself vague in the sense that it is not clear whether the development and utilization of the lands referred to in that statement was confined to the lands mentioned in the schedule to the Notification or it applied to a wider area of which such lands formed only a part The affidavit only states that the authority i the Commissioner of <ORG> was satisfied hat the possession of the said lands was urgently required for the purpose of carrying out the said development Even Mr <NAME> conceded that the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on which the authority was satisfied or on which it formed its opinion It is therefore quite clear that the respondents have failed to bring on record any material what ever on which the respondents formed the opinion mentioned in the two notifications The notifica tions themselves show that they concern many lands other than those failing in the said first and third groups It is not possible to know what was the development for which the lands were being acquired much less is it possible to know what were the circumstances which caused urgency in the taking of possession of such lands We have held that the burden of proving such circumstances at least prima facie is on the respondents As the respondents have brought no relevant material on the record the respondents have failed to dis charge that burden It has been submitted on behalf of the <ORG> that we need decide nothing more than a simple question of burden of proof in the cases before us We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought to be made out here Indeed the apparent simplicity of a question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof which have to always viewed together is often deceptive Over simplification of such questions leads to erroneous statements and misapplications of the law It is fixed at the begin ning of the trial by the state of the pleadings and it is settled as a question of law remaining unchanged throughout the trial exactly where the pleadings place it and never shifting in any circumstances whatever Where a corporation does an act under statutory powers which do not prescribe the method and that act invades the rights of others the burden is on the corporation to show that there was no other practi cal way of carrying out the power which would have that effect Turning now to the provisions of our own Evi dence Act we find the general or stable burden of proving a case stated in section as follows The principle is stated in section from the point of view of what has been sometimes called the burden of leading or introducing evidence which is placed on the party initiating a proceeding In practice this lesser burden is discharged by merely showing that there is evidence in the case which supports the case set up by the party which comes to <ORG> first irrespective of the side which has led that evidence Sometimes evidence coming from the side of the respondents in the form of either their admissions or conduct or failure to controvert may strengthen or tend to support a petitioner or plaintiff case so much that the heavier burden of proving or establishing a case as distinguished from the mere duty of introducing or showing the existence of some evidence on record stated in section is itself discharged party which initiates a proceeding or comes with a case to <ORG> offers no evidence to support it the presumption is that such evidence does not exist Coming back to the cases before us we find that <ORG> had correctly stated the grounds on which even a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need to take action under section of the Act can be challenged on certain limited grounds But as soon as we speak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general burdens laid down by sections and of the Evidence Act It is for the petitioner to substantiate the grounds of his challenge This means that the petitioner has to either lead evidence or show that some evidence has come from the side of the respondents to indicate that his challenge to a notification or order is made good If he does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition will fail But is that the position in the cases before us We find that although <ORG> had stated the ques tion before it to be one which narrows down to the point as to the burden of proof yet it had analysed the evi dence sufficiently before it to reach the conclusion that the urgency provision under section had not been validly resorted to We do not think that the vagueness of the purpose as stated in the notification under section really affected the judgment of he <ORG> so much as the absence of facts and circumstances which could possibly indicate that this purpose had neces sarily to be carried out in such a way as to exclude the application of section A of the Act in King Emperor <NAME> which was relied upon on behalf of the State to contend that it was the duty of the petitioners to remove the effect of a recital in an order showing that conditions precedent to the exercise of a power had been fulfilled It is quite a different thing to question the accuracy of a recital contained in a duly authenticated order particularly where that recit al purports to state as a fact the carrying out of what I regard as a condition necessary to the valid making of that order The presence of the recital in the order will place a difficult burden on the detenu to produce admissi ble evidence sufficient to establish even a prima facie case that the recital is not accurate If however in any case a detenu can produce admis sible evidence to that effect in my judgment the mere existence of the recital in the order cannot prevent the court considering such evidence and if it thinks fit coming to a conclusion that the recital is inaccurate We think that the original or stable onus land down by section and section of the Evidence Act can not be shifted by the use of section of the Evidence Act although the particular onus of proving facts and circumstances lying especially within the knowledge of the official who formed the opinion which resulted in the notification under sec tion of the Act rests upon that official Such an attitude may itself justify Further judi cial scrutiny We do not think that the principle laid down in <NAME> case supra can be circumvented by merely citing section of the Evidence Act as <ORG> did It has been repeatedly laid down that the doctrine of onus of proof becomes unimportant when there is sufficient evidence before the <ORG> to enable it to reach a particular conclusion On the other hand if in addition to the bare assertions made by the petition ers that the urgency contemplated by section did not exist there were other facts and circumstances including the failure of the <ORG> to indicate facts and circum stances which it could have easily disclosed if they exist ed the petitioners could be held to have discharged their general onus We think that the matter is not so simple as to capa ble of decision on an examination of a mere recital in the order or notification as was urged on behalf of the State of Maharashtra This was clearly laid down by this Court in <ORG> case supra where <NAME> speaking for the Constitution Bench of this Court said The difference between a case where a gener al order contains a recital on the face of it and one where it does not contain such a recital is that in the latter case the burden is thrown on the authority making the order to satisfy the <ORG> by other means that the conditions precedent were fulfilled but in the former case the <ORG> will presume the regularity of the order including the fulfilment of the conditions precedent and then it will be for the party challenging the legality of the order to show that the recital was not correct and that the conditions precedent were not in fact complied with by the authority see the observa tions of Spens in King Emperor <NAME> which were approved by the Privy Coun cil in King Emperor <NAME> This <ORG> also said there Our conclusion therefore is that where certain conditions precedent have to be satisfied before a subordinate authority can pass an order be it executive or of the character of subordi nate legislation it is not necessary that the satisfaction of those conditions must be recited in the order itself unless the statute requires it though as we have already remarked it is most desirable that it should be so for in that case the presumption that the conditions were satisfied would immediately arise and burden would be thrown on the person challenging the fact of satis faction to show that what is recited is not cor rect But even where the recital is not there on the face of the order the order will not become illegal ab initio and only a further burden is thrown on the authority passing the order to satisfy the <ORG> by other means that the condi tions precedent were complied with And a fortiori the <ORG> may consider red decide whether the authority concerned has applied its mind to really relevant facts If it appears upon an examination of the totality of facts in the case that the power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied at all to the real object or purpose of a power so that the result is that the exer cise of power could only serve some other or collateral object the <ORG> will interfere a Constitution bench of this Court held It is true that the opinion of <ORG> which is a condition for the exercise of the power under of the Act is subjec tive and a Court cannot normally enquire whether there were sufficient grounds or justification for the opinion formed by <ORG> under But even though the power of <ORG> has been formulated under of the Act in subjective terms the expression of opinion of <ORG> can be challenged as ultra vires in <ORG> if it could be shown that <ORG> never applied its mind to the matter or that the action of <ORG> is malafide If therefore in a case the land under acquisition is not actual ly waste or arable land but <ORG> has formed the opinion that the provisions of sub of are applicable the Court may legiti mately draw an inference that <ORG> did not honestly form that opinion or that in forming that opinion <ORG> did not apply its mind to the relevant facts bearing on the question at issue It follows therefore that the notification of <ORG> under of the Act directing that the provisions of A shall not apply to the land is ultra vires Learned counsel for the <ORG> relied strongly on the judgment of this Court in I joshi Etc where this Court had pointed out how in <NAME> case supra the initial burden of the petitioner arising from a prima facie correct order had been repelled by an affidavit filed by Mr <NAME> Additional Home Secretary on behalf of the <ORG> showing that the mind of the authority concerned had not been independently applied to the require ments of law but a routine order had apparently been passed on materials supplied by the <ORG> As stated already there is a strong presumption of regularity of official acts and added thereto is the did whether he had the necessary authority to do so We do not think that we need express any opinion here on the question whether such an assertion can or cannot even raise a triable issue Indeed questions relating to validity of the notification on the ground of malafides do not seem to US to be ordinari ly open in a summary enquiry under section A of the Act waste and arable land but also to situations in which an inquiry under section A will serve no useful purpose or for some overriding reason it should be dispensed with The mind of the Officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is fan urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under section A which has to be considered Section deals with a case in which an enquiry under section A of the Act could not possibly serve any useful purpose It results in more or less indicating by an operation of natural physical forces beyond human control what land should be urgently taken possession of This in itself on the face of it does not call for any such action barring exceptional circumstances as to make immediate possession without holding even a summary enquiry under section A of the Act imperative On the other hand such schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable at least summary inquiries under section A of the Act to be completed without any impediment whatso ever to the execution of the scheme the land was to be acquired indicated the absence of such urgency on the apparent facts of the case as to require the elimination of an enquiry under section A of the Act Again the uniform and set recital of a formula like a ritual or mantara apparently applied mechanically to every case itself indicated that the mind of the Commissioner concerned was only applied to the question whether the land was waste or arable and whether its acquisition is urgently needed All schemes relating to development of industrial and residential areas must be urgent in the context of the country need for increased production and more residential accommodation Yet the very nature of such schemes of development does not appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary enquires under section A of the Act There is no indication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> that the mind of the Commis sioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under section A of the Act The recitals in the notifications on the other hand indicate that elimination of the enquiry under section A of the Act was treated as an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other matters The recital does not say at all that any opinion was formed on the need to dispense with the enquiry under section A of the Act The burden therefore rested upon the <ORG> to remove the defect if possible by evidence to show that some exceptional circumstances which necessitated the elimination of an enquiry under section A of the Act and that the mind of the Commissioner was applied to this essen tial question It seems to us that <ORG> correctly applied the provisions of section of the Evidence Act to place the burden upon the <ORG> to prove those special circumstances that <ORG> was not quite correct in stating its view in such a manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial burden of the petitioners under sections and of the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the <ORG> to discharge its duty under section of the Act The correct way of putting it would have been to say that the failure of the <ORG> to produce the evidence of facts espe cially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under section of the Evidence Act taken together with the attendant facts gnu circumstances includ ing the contents of recitals had enabled the petitioners to discharge their burdens under sections and of the Evidence Act We may also observe that if instead of prolonging litigation by appealing to this Court the State Government had ordered expeditious enquiries under section A of the Act or even afforded the petitioners some opportunity of being heard before acting under section of the Act asking them to show cause why no enquiry under section A of the Act should take place at all the acquisition proceed ings need not have been held up so long On the view we take of the cases before us we find no force in either the appeals by the owners of land or in those preferred by the State of Maharashtra Consequently we dismiss all the nine appeals before us The parties will bear their own costs
