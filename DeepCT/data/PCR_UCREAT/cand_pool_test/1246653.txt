The basic question of law which arises in these matters is whether the report of the Inquiry Officer authority who which is appointed by the disciplinary authority to hold an inquiry into the charges against the delinquent employee is required to be furnished to the employee to enable him to make proper representation to the disciplinary authority before such authority arrives at its own finding with regard to the guilt or otherwise of the employee and the punishment if any to be awarded to him This question in turn gives rise to the following incidental questions i Whether the report should be furnished to the employee even when the statutory rules laying down the procedure for holding the disciplinary inquiry are silent on the subject or are against it ii Whether the report of the Inquiry Officer is required to be furnished to the delinquent employee even when the punishment imposed is other than the major punishment of dismissal removal or reduction in rank iii Whether the obligation to furnish the report is only when the employee asks for the same or whether it exists even otherwise iv Whether the law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra will apply to all establishments Government and <ORG> public and private sector undertakings What is the effect of the non furnishing of the report on the order of punishment and what relief should be granted to the employee in such cases vi From what date the law requiring furnishing of the report should come into operation vii Since the decision in <NAME> case AIR SC supra has made the law laid down there prospective in operation i applicable to the orders of punishment passed after th November on which day the said decision was delivered this question in turn also raises another question viz The Act also provided that the inquiry may be committed either to the <ORG> <ORG> or any other authority to which the accused public servant was subordinate or to any other person or persons to be specially appointed as Commissioners for the purpose of of that Act authorised the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to make rules for regulating the classification of the civil services the methods of their recruitments their conditions of service pay and allowances and discipline and conduct In pursuance of these powers the Civil Services Classification Rules were framed and Rule XIV of the said Rules provided that without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act in all cases in which the dismissal removal or reduction in rank of any officer is ordered the order shall except when it is based on facts or conclusions established at a judicial trial or when the officer concerned has absconded with the accusations hanging over him be preceded by a properly recorded departmental inquiry However there was no provision made in the Rules for hearing the delinquent officer against the action proposed to be taken on the basis of the finding arrived at in the inquiry Rule thereof contained the same provisions as those contained in XIV of Rules and made no difference to the earlier position of law on the subject It stated that the civil servant shall not be dismissed or reduced in rank until he had been given reasonable opportunity to show cause against action proposed to be taken in regard to him The expression reasonable opportunity to show cause was accordingly interpreted to mean an opportunity at that stage to represent to the authority against the tentative findings both with regard to the guilt and the proposed punishment It was therefore held that in order that the employee had an effective opportunity to show cause against the finding of guilt and the punishment proposed he should at that stage be furnished with a copy of the findings of the inquiring authority Probably the specific addition was on account of the interpretation placed by the courts Article however underwent change with the Constitution th Amendment Act of which came into force from th October For the original expression until he has been given reasonble opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him the provision except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges and where it is proposed after such inquiry to impose on him any such penalty until he has been given reasonable opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed but only on the basis of the evidence adduced during such inquiry was substituted It would thus be apparent that the th Amendment for the first time in terms provided for holding of an inquiry into the specific charges of which information was given to the delinquent employee in advance and in which he was given reasonable opportunity to defend himself against those charges The Amendment also provided for a second opportunity to the employee to show cause against the penalty if it was proposed as a result of the inquiry The courts held that while exercising his second opportunity of showing cause against the penalty the employee was also entitled to represent against the findings on charges as well It came into force from st January It expressly stated that it shall not be necessary to give such person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed The words such person of course meant the person who was to be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank during the inquiry as introduced by the th Amendment of the Constitution did away with the opportunity of making representation against the penalty proposed after the inquiry which has given rise to the controversy as to whether when the Inquiry Officer is other than the disciplinary authority the employee is entitled to a copy of the findings recorded by him before the disciplinary authority applies its mind to the findings and the evidence recorded or whether the employee is entitled to the copy of the findings of the enquiry Officer only at the second stage viz what is meant by the expression reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed and at what stage the notice against the proposed punishment was to be served on the delinquent employee as originally enacted was at the following stages a An opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his innocence which he can only do if he is told what the charges levelled against him are and the allegations on which such charges are based an opportunity to defend himself by cross examining the witnesses produced against him and by examining himself or any other witnesses in support of his defence and finally an opportunity to make his representation as to why the proposed punishment should not be inflicted on him which he can only do if the competent authority after the inquiry is over and after applying his mind to the gravity or otherwise of the charges proved against the government servant tentatively proposes to inflict one of the three punishments and communicates the same to the government servant The Court further held that the substance of the protection provided by rules like of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules promulgated on May under of the Government of India Act sic was bodily lifted out of the said Rules and together with an additional opportunity embodied in The Court also held that the opportunity to show cause against the penalty proposed should be given after a stage has been reached where the charges had been established and the competent authority had applied its mind to the gravity or otherwise of the proved charges tentatively and proposed a particular punishment Hence it was also observed that in the communication addressed by the Inquiry Officer the punishment proposed to be imposed upon the appellant if he was found guilty of the charges could not properly be set out that it is not the function of the inquiry Officer to propose any punishment even after he records findings of guilt against the delinquent employee Secondly it is for the disciplinary authority to propose the punishment after receipt of the report of the Inquiry Officer which suggests that before the authority proposes the punishment it must have applied its mind to the evidence and the findings recorded by the Inquiry Officer Still further question that was required to be answered was whether when the disciplinary authority issued notice to the employee to show cause against the punishment proposed the employee had the right also to represent that he was not guilty of the charge itself and the findings recorded against him were wrong The <ORG> pointed out there that it was well settled that the public servant entitled to the protection of Art must get two opportunities to defend himself He must have a clear notice of the charge which he is called upon to meet before the departmental inquiry commences and after he gets a notice and is given the opportunity to offer his explanation the inquiry must be conducted according to the rules and consistently with the requirements of natural justice It is to enable the <ORG> to hold an investigation into the charges framed against the employee so that the <ORG> can in due course consider the evidence adduced and decide whether the said charges are proved or not For at the second stage the opportunity which is intended to be given to the public servant is to show cause not only against the proposed punishment but also against the finding recorded against him and that opportunity would be defeated because the <ORG> cannot alter the said finding even if the employee shows that the findings are incorrect In <NAME> Inspector General of Police Punjab Serv LR SC admittedly the findings of the Inquiry Officer were not communicated to the delinquent employee and he was only orally told that it was proposed to dismiss him The Court in this context held that every public servant is entitled to have the whole of the matter brought to his notice before he was asked to show cause why particular punishment should not be meted out to him Even if the inquiry committee makes a report absolving the employee of the charges against him the disciplinary authority may on considering the entire record come to a different conclusion and impose a penalty A reference is made in this connection to <NAME> case AIR SC supra The broad test of reasonable opportunity is whether in the given case the show cause notice issued to the delinquent servant contained or was accompanied by so much information as was necessary to enable him to clear himself of the guilt if possible even at that stage or in the alternative to show that the penalty proposed was much too harsh and disproportionate to the nature of the charge established against him and where it is proposed after such inquiry to impose on him any such penalty until he has been given reasonable opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed but only on the basis of the evidence adduced during such inquiry was deleted In that decision this Court has not dealt with the procedure to be followed by the disciplinary authority after the Inquiry Officer report is received by it before the disciplinary authority took its decision on the said report and came to its own conclusions with regard to the guilt or innocence of the employee Since it was raised in ignorance of the nd Amendment of the Constitution this Court rejected the said contention It was opined that in the event of failure to furnish the report of the Inquiry Officer the delinquent employee is deprived of crucial and critical material which is taken into account by the real authority which holds him guilty viz It was observed that there could be glaring errors and omissions in the report or it may have been based on no evidence or rendered in disregard to or by overlooking evidence The <ORG> then found that the said point required consideration by a larger Bench and referred the matter to Hon ble the Chief Justice for placing it before a larger Bench Since it is contended that in <NAME> State of SCC AIR SC a Bench of three learned Judges has taken a view that it is not necessary to furnish the report of the Inquiry Officer to the delinquent employee before the disciplinary authority arrives at its conclusions it is necessary to consider the said authority a little closely <ORG> thereafter requested the Governor to remove the petitioner from service and the impugned order terminating the services of the petitioner was accordingly passed The petitioner had also filed an application under Article of the Constitution before <ORG> which was dismissed in limine One of the contentions raised before this <ORG> by the counsel for the petitioner was that a copy of the report of <ORG> was not made available to the petitioner and this must be held to have vitiated the subsequent proceedings including the impugned order of punishment that although on account of the nd Amendment of the Constitution it was no longer necessary to issue a notice to the delinquent employee to show cause against the punishment proposed and therefore to furnish a copy of the Inquiry Officer report along with the notice to make representation against the penalty whether it was still necessary to furnish a copy of the report to him to enable him to make representation against the findings recorded against him in the report before the disciplinary authority took its own decision with regard to the guilt or otherwise of the employee by taking into consideration the said report They do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it If that is their purpose there is no reason why they should not be made applicable to administrative proceedings also especially when it is not easy to draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries from quasi judicial ones What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the inquiry is held and the constitution of the tribunal or the body of persons appointed for that purpose What emerges from the above survey of the law on the subject is as follows Since the <ORG> of India Act till the nd Amendment of the Constitution the <ORG> servant had always the right to receive report of the Inquiry Officer authority and to represent against the findings recorded in it when the Inquiry Officer authority was not the disciplinary authority when he was served with a notice to show cause against the proposed penalty The issuance of the notice to show cause against the penalty necessarily required the furnishing of a copy of the inquiry Officer report since as held by the Courts the right to show cause against the penalty also implied the right to represent against the findings on the charges The two rights came to be confused with each other bacause as the law stood prior to the nd Amendment of the Constitution the two rights arose simultaneously only at the stage when a notice to show cause against the proposed penalty was issued If the disciplinary authority after considering the Inquiry Officer report had dropped the proceedings or had decided to impose a penalty other than that of dismissal removal or reduction in rank there was no occasion for issuance of the notice to show cause against the proposed penalty In that case the employee had neither the right to receive the report and represent against the finding of guilt nor the right to show cause against the proposed penalty Since the nd Amendment of the Constitution dispensed with the issuance of the notice to show cause against the penalty proposed even if it was dismissal removal or reduction in rank some courts took the view that the <ORG> servant was deprived of his right to represent against the findings of guilt as well The reason why the right to receive the report of the Inquiry Officer is considered an essential part of the reasonable opportunity it the first stage and also a principle of natural justice is that the findings recorded by the Inquiry Officer form an important material before the disciplinary authority which along with the evidence is taken into consideration by it to come to its conclusions Both the dictates of the reasonable opportunity as well as the principles of natural justice therefore require that before the disciplinary authority comes to its own conclusions the delinquent employee should have an opportunity to reply to the Inquiry Officer findings The employee right to receive the report is thus a part of the reasonable opportunity of defending himself in the first stage of the inquiry If this right is denied to him he is in effect denied the right to defend himself and to prove his innocence in the disciplinary proceedings Article says that the employee shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of the charges against him What is further when the proviso to the said Article states that where it is proposed after such inquiry to impose upon him any such penalty such penalty may be imposed on the basis of the evidence adduced during such inquiry and it shall not be necessary to give such person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed it in effect accepts two successive stages of differing scope The second stage follows the inquiry so carried out and it consists of the issuance of the notice to show cause against the proposed penalty and of considering the reply to the notice and deciding upon the penalty What is dispensed with is the opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed and not of opportunity of making representation on the report of the Inquiry Officer Now the disciplinary authority has to consider the representation of the employee against the report before it arrives at its conclusion with regard to his guilt or innocence of the charges Hence it has to be held that when the Inquiry Officer is not the disciplinary authority the delinquent employee has right to receive a copy of the inquiry Officer report before the disciplinary authority arrives at its conclusions with regard to the guilt or innocence of the employee with regard to the charges levelled against him A denial of the Inquiry Officer report before the disciplinary authority takes its decision on the charges is a denial of reasonable opportunity to the employee to prove his innocence and is a breach of the principles of natural justice Whenever therefore the service rules contemplate an inquiry before a punishment is awarded and when the Inquiry Officer is not the disciplinary authority the delinquent employee will have the right to receive the Inquiry Officer report notwithstanding the nature of the punishment that the right to make representation to the disciplinary authority against the findings recorded in the inquiry report is an integral part of the opportunity of defence against the charges and is a breach of principles of natural justice to deny the said right it is only appropriate that the law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra should apply to employees in all establishments whether <ORG> or non <ORG> public or private This will be the case whether there are rules governing the disciplinary proceeding or not and whether they expressly prohibit the furnishing of the copy of the report or are silent on the subject When the employee is dismissed or removed from service and the inquiry is set aside because the report is not furnished to him in some cases the non furnishing of the report may have prejudiced him gravely while in other cases it may have made no difference to the ultimate punishment awarded to him If after hearing the parties <ORG> Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the non supply of the report would have made no difference to the ultimate findings and the punishment given <ORG> should not interfere with the order of punishment The question whether the employee would be entitled to the back wages and other benefits from the date of his dismissal to the date of his reinstatement if ultimately ordered should invariably be left to be decided by the authority concerned according to law after the culmination of the proceedings and depending on the final outcome The Court moulded the relief taking into consideration the long period which had passed and directed that the employee would be put back to the same position where he left off but his new salary will be what he would draw were he to be appointed in the same post today de novo He was not allowed to claim any advantages in the matter of seniority As has been discussed earlier a<ORG>hough the furnishing of the Inquiry Officer report to the delinquent employee is a part of the reasonable opportunity available to him to defend himself against the charges before nd Amendment of the Constitution the stage at which the said opportunity became available to the employee had stood deferred till the second notice requiring him to show cause against the pena<ORG>y was issued to him The law laid down was not applicable to the orders of punishment passed before that date notwithstanding the fact that the proceedings arising out of the same were pending in courts after that date In this connection we may refer to some well known decisions on the point The <ORG> pointed out that there was an essential distinction between the Constitution and the statutes It was left to the discretion of the court to prescribe the limits of the retroactivity The <ORG> then pointed out that there was no statutory prohibition against the <ORG> refusing to give retroactivity to the law declared by it The <ORG> then declared that the said decision will not affect the validity of the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act or other amendments made to the Constitution taking away or abridging the fundamental rights The <ORG> also declared that in future <ORG> will have no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights The Court while holding that the relevant provisions of the Act were ultra vires the Constitution gave a direction that the suits and appeals which were pending in various courts will be disposed of in accordance with the declaration made in the said decision Where however the decrees had become final they were directed to be binding inter partes and it was held that the declaration granted by the Court with regard to the invalidity of the provisions of the Act would be of no avail to the parties to such decree Although the <ORG> held that the levy was invalid since its inception the <ORG> held that a finding regarding the invalidity of the levy need not automatically result in a direction for a refund of all collections thereof made earlier The <ORG> held that the declaration regarding the invalidity of a provision of the Act enabling levy and the determination of the relief to be granted were two different things and in the latter sphere the <ORG> had and it must be held to have a certain amount of discretion It is open to the <ORG> to grant moulded or restricted relief in a manner most appropriate to the situation before it and in such a way as to advance the interest of justice On this view the <ORG> refused to give a direction to refund to the assessees any of the amounts of cess collected until the date of the decision since such refund would work hardship and injustice to the State The direction with regard to the prospective operation of the law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra was followed by various Benches of this Court viz It is in these circumstances that this <ORG> relying upon the proposition of law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra held that the order of dismissal was vitiated It also appears that <ORG> and some <ORG> of <ORG> have given retrospective effect to the law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra notwithstanding the fact that the said decision itself had expressly made the law prospective in operation The fact however remains that although the judgments in <NAME> case and <NAME> case supra as well as some of the decisions of <ORG> and of the <ORG> of <ORG> were either taking a similar view prior to the decision in <NAME> case supra or giving retrospective effect to the said view and those decisions were not specifically challenged the other decisions taking the same view were under challenge before this Court both before <NAME> case supra was decided and thereafter In fact as stated in the beginning the reference to this Bench was made in one such case as late as on the th August and the matters before us have raised the same question of law It has therefore to be accepted that at least till this Court took the view in question in <NAME> case AIR SC supra the law on the subject was in a flux Indeed it is contended on behalf of the appellants petitioners before us that the law on the subject is not settled even till this day in view of the apparent conflict in decisions of this Court The learned Judges who referred the matter to this Bench had also taken the same view We have pointed out that there was no contradiction between the view taken in <NAME> case AIR SC supra and the view taken by this court in the earlier cases and the reliance placed on <NAME> case AIR SC supra to contend that a contrary view was taken there was not well merited No order of punishment passed before that date would be challengeable on the ground that there was a failure to furnish the inquiry report to the delinquent employee The proceedings pending in courts tribunals in respect of orders of punishment passed prior to th November will have to be decided according to the law that prevailed prior to the said date and not according to the law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra The need to make the law laid down in <NAME> case AIR SC supra prospective in operation requires no emphasis As pointed out above in view of the unsettled position of the law on the subject the authorities managements all over the country had proceeded on the basis that there was no need to furnish a copy of the report of the Inquiry Officer to the delinquent employee and innumerable employees have been punished without giving them the copies of the reports Both administrative reality and public interests do not therefore require that the orders of punishment passed prior to the decision in <NAME> case supra without furnishing the report of the Inquiry Officer should be disturbed and the disciplinary proceedings which gave rise to the said orders should be reopened on that account Since my learned brother has critically examined in extenso the historical development and the interpretation given to of the Government of India Act and Art In Civil Appeal No Enquiry Officer after giving an opportunity to the respondent submitted his report and the disciplinary authority agreeing with the findings of guilt recorded by the enquiry officer reverted him to the grade of Ticket Collector in the pay scale of Rs On October he was served with a charge sheet and it violates the principle of natural justice These facts have been stated with a view to illustrate that <NAME> ratio was applied by the Courts Tribunals to the cases where rules are either absent or Statutory Rules were amended after Constitution nd Amendment Act omitting the obligation to supply a copy of the enquiry report It is settled law that the disciplinary authority by whatever name called has power and jurisdiction to enquire into the misconduct by himself or by his delegate and to impose the penalty for proved misconduct of a delinquent it was held thus If the opportunity to show cause is to be a reasonable one it is clear that he should be informed about the charge or charges levelled against him and the evidence by which it is sought to be established for it is only then that he will be able to put forward his defence servant an opportunity to exonerate himself from the charge and if this opportunity is to be a reasonable one he should be allowed to show that the evidence against him is not worthy of credence or consideration and that he can only do if he is given a chance to cross examine the witnesses called against him and to examine himself or any other witness in support of his defence All this appears to us to be implicit in the language used in the clause but this does not exhaust his rights In addition to showing that he has not been guilty of any misconduct so as to merit any punishment it is reasonable that he should also have an opportunity to contend that the charges proved against him do not necessarily require the particular punishment proposed to be meted out to him There is just one continuous proceeding though there are two stages in it It is only after all the material has been placed on record by both the sides the stage of recording a finding would arise does not accept the findings of the <ORG> and proposes to impose the penalty it should give reasons as to why it differ from the conclusions of the <ORG> though even in such a case it is not necessary that the reasons should be detailed or it be a judgment There is no evidence for proof thereof but evidence adduced establishes that he had not made full amount to those entitled to compensation There was no charge in that behalf nor any charge that he has authorised anyone to collect any fee which was sought to be set up in the evidence were conjectures and there was no evidence to show that any amount was deducted by the delinquent himself or at his instance or even by his connivance In that view it was held that it is difficult to hold that there was due compliance with the requirement of Art Lab LJ AIR SC a Bench of three Judges held that the employer must lead evidence against the concerned employee giving him reasonable chance to test the said evidence allow him liberty to lead evidence in defence and then come to a decision of his own The notice must therefore give a reasonable opportunity to the workmen It would thus be clear that the report together with the findings on the charge and the recommendations if any would constitute appropriate material for consideration by the disciplinary authority Brief reasons in this behalf also always lend assurance of the application of the mind and consideration given to the case by the disciplinary authority which would be a factor <ORG> or the <ORG> would take into consideration even on the nature of the penalty He may also persuade <ORG> that the finding is based on no evidence or the relevant material evidence was not considered or overlooked by the enquiry officer in coming to the conclusions with a view to persuade <ORG> to disagree with the enquiry officer and to consider his innocence of the charge or even that the guilt as to the misconduct has not been established on the evidence on records or disabuse the initial impression formed in the minds of <ORG> on consideration of the enquiry report Even if <ORG> comes to the conclusion that charge or charges is are proved the case may not warrant imposition of any penalty The enquiry report constitutes fresh material which has great persuasive force or effect on the mind of the disciplinary authority Therein the students were given an opportunity of hearing and they were supplied with all the material the foundation for the report Therein it was pointed out that under A of the I Act there was no scope of enquiry at two stages and the omission to supply enquiry report before taking the action did not vitiate the ultimate decision taken It was held that the delinquent officer was supplied with all the materials and was given opportunity to make representation and the same was considered However the disciplinary authority has an objective duty and adjudicatory responsibility to consider and impose proper penalty consistent with the magnitude or the gravity of the misconduct The statute or statutory rules gave graded power and authority to the disciplinary authority to impose either of the penalties enumerated in the relevant provisions In a given case if the penalty was proved to be disproportionate or there is no case even to find the charges proved or the charges are based on no evidence that would be for the court the tribunal to consider on merits not as court of appeal but within its parameters of supervisory jurisdiction and to give appropriate relief I respectfully agree with my brother <NAME> <NAME> in other respects in the draft judgment proposed by him are the proponents of the articulation and efficacy of prospective overruling or prospective application of a new principle laid by the courts At it was further stated that there are occasions where judicial innovation is valuable and appropriate In a society overwhelmed by a consciousness of the vastness and variety of its tasks there is opportunity for social responsibility in all branches of <ORG> But per majority held that the banker though honest misrepresentation spoken or written was negligent and it may give rise to an action for damages for financial loss caused thereby any contract or fiduciary relationship apart since law will imply a duty of care when a party seeking information from a party possessed of a special skill trusts him to exercise due care and that party knew or ought to have known that reliance was being placed on his skill and judgment The Court held that we have no occasion to consider whether this division in time of the effects of a decision as a sound or an unsound application of a doctrine of stare decisis as known to the common law This is not a case where a court in overruling an earlier decision has given to a new ruling a retroactive bearing and thereby has made invalid what was valid in the doing The choice for any state may be determined by the juristic philosophy of the judges of her courts their conceptions of law its origin and nature The court held that even though it involved constitutional right of accused it would look into the purpose of the newly evolved rule the reliance placed on the former rule and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective operation of the new rule have to be considered The Court must determine in each case by looking to the peculiar traits of the specific rule in question even if the new rule has already been applied to the parties before the court in the case in which the rule was announced its impact on the administration of justice be taken into account the extent to which safeguards other than that involved in the new rule are available to protect the integrity of the truth determining process at trial On certiorari the <ORG> of United States reversed the decision and held that the constitutional right gives them the remedy for damages of Lusiana to recover for personal injury prospectively two years earlier to the date of filing the suit Where a decision of the court could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retrospectively there is ample basis for avoiding injustice or hardship by a holding of non retrospectivity III protection offending independence of judiciary the court applied the law prospectively while giving relief to the plaintiff therein stayed its operation until a further date affording opportunity to the <ORG> to amend the Law to reconstitute bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws The benefit of the decision must be given to the parties before the <ORG> even though applied to future cases from that date prospectively would not be extended to the parties whose adjudication either had become final or matters are pending trial or in appeal There is no distinction between civil and criminal litigation The ratio of <ORG> of A consistently given the benefit of overruling decision to the successful party received commendation from the academic lawyers Accordingly I hold that the ratio in <NAME> case AIR SC would apply prospectively from the date of the judgment only to the cases in which decisions are taken and orders made from that date and does not apply to all the matters which either have become final or are pending decision at the appellate forum or in <ORG> or the <ORG> or in this <ORG>
