<ORG> upheld the contention of the respondents and quashed the notifications issued under sections and of the Act on the ground that if the <ORG> concerned filed any reply pursuant to the notice issued the objector would know what the <ORG> has stated by way of reply and at the stage of hearing of objection could further urge before the <ORG> that the reasons given by the department in reply to the objections should not be accepted On appeal by Special Leave it was contended by the appellant Rule is inconsistent With section A for the reasons that sub section of section A provides for further enquiry in the discretion of the Collector and rule if treated as mandatory would be to convert the discretionary power into a mandatory duty and is therefore ultra vires the section In determining the question whether a provision is mandatory or directory one must look into the subject matter One has to consider the nature the design and the consequence which will follow from construing a provision in one way or the other Rule was enacted for the purpose of enabling the Collector to have all the relevant materials before him for coming to a conclusion to be incorporated A in the report to be sent to the <ORG> in order to enable the <ORG> to make proper decision CIVIL APPEAL No or The respondents raised further contention in the above appeal to the effect that notification under section should be quashed since the public notice as required by section is not given and the report under section A was not sent to the <ORG> within the prescribed period There is no substance in the argument that the report under section A was not sent to the <ORG> within the prescribed period In any event since a fresh enquiry is directed under section A the Collector will in any event have to send a fresh report to the <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Civil Appeals Nos of <NAME> We take up for consideration Civil Appeal No In a notification under of the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter called the Act dated and published in <ORG> dated it was stated that in view of the urgency of the cases the provisions of SA of the Act shall not apply to the case The memo was to this effect The respondent agrees to modify the impugned notification issued under Section read with Section of the Land Acquisition Act and to give an opportunity to the petitioner of being heard under Section A of the Act Hence the relief sought for by the petitioner becomes unnecessary The Special Land Acquisition officer Mangalore issued notices to the respondents stating that the respondents will be given opportunity to file Objections under A of the Act pursuant to the order in Writ Petition No of <ORG> by its order upheld the contention of the respondents and quashed the notifications issued under and of the Act It is against this order that the appeal has been filed by special leave by the State of Karnataka and the Special Land Acquisition officer Mangalore The only point which arises for consideration is whether the pro visions of rule were mandatory and therefore the failure to issue the notice to the department concerned as enjoined by the rule was fatal to the validity of the notifications under sections and of the Act The reasons which impelled <ORG> to come to that conclusion were if the <ORG> to which a notice is issued files any reply by way of answer to the objections the objector will know what the <ORG> has stated by way of reply and at the stage Of hearing of objections he the objector may adduce evidence or A address arguments to meet what has been stated in such reply and that the objectors will have an opportunity of urging before the Government that the reasons given by the <ORG> in the reply to the objections should not be accepted The argument was that when sub section of A provides for further inquiry in the discretion of the Collector a rule making it mandatory that the Deputy Commissioner the Collector should give notice of the objection to the department concerned and consider its answer to the objection would be to convert a discretionary power into a mandatory duty and is therefore ultra vires the section What the material provision of A says is that the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further enquiry if any as he thinks necessary We also think that the government when it framed the rule had in mind that the Deputy Commissioner Collector should follow it while functioning under A and so the requirement of the rule was mandatory In determining the question whether a provision is mandatory or directory one must look into the subject matter and consider the importance of the provision disregarded and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured We see no reason why the rule should receive a permissible interpretation instead of a pre emptory construction As we said the rule was enacted for the purpose of enabling the Deputy Commissioner Land Acquisition Collector to have all the relevant materials before him for coming to a conclusion to be incorporated in the report to be sent to the Government in order to enable the Government to make the proper decision We direct the Collector nd appellant to proceed with the inquiry on the basis of the objection already filed under A after A I Kerala We dismiss the appeal subject to the modification indicated For the reasons given in the judgment in Civil Appeal No of dismiss Civil Appeal No of also with the modification indicated therein and without any order as to costs The notification under was published on Objections were filed by the respondent under A of the Act The notification under was published in the gazette on The Writ Petition challenging the validity of the notification was filed some time in July or August If public notice as required by of the Act was not given and that would per se vitiate the notification under the appellant should have challenged its validity within a reasonable time of the publication of the notification In these circumstances we see no reason to accept the submission of counsel We also see no substance in the argument of the counsel that the report drawn up under SA was not sent to the <ORG> within the time prescribed and therefore the proceedings were invalid In this view we do not think that there is any ground for remitting the case to <ORG> simply because <ORG> failed to consider these points
