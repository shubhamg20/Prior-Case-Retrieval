This appeal raises a question of subrogation The facts necessary for the disposal of the same lie in a narrow compass on a mortgage dated rd October executed by defendants to and their father late <NAME> in her favour There was a prior mortgage on the said property dated st August They therefore claim a right of subrogation in respect of the said sum on the ground that by their having discharged the said decree debt they are subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee under the deed dated st August It is conceded that the matter is governed by Section of the Transfer of Property Act but it is contended that defendants and have a right of subrogation under Clause i of the said section It applies to all persons who have an interest in the equity of redemption and are under no personal obligation to discharge prior encumbrances The clause is intended to apply to all persons who acquire an interest in the mortgaged property by advancing moneys to discharge prior incumbrances and there is no warrant for restricting the scope of that clause to persons other than purchasers or mortgagees as contended by Mr <NAME> The distinction between the two classes of cases aforesaid namely those who have an existing interest in the property and those who acquire an interest therein by advancing money is well recognised in the law relating to subrogation Since the date of this decision the matter was considered by a Full Bench of <ORG> and a Full Bench of <ORG> In that case certain properties were sold for discharging the prior encumbrances and as there was no registered instrument in the case the right of subrogation was refused The actual decision in that case is that A purchaser of a property with whom is left part of the consideration of the sale in his favour for paying off a mortgage but in whose favour there is no express agreement of subrogation in writing registered is not entitled to claim subrogation against a later mortgagee under Section of the Transfer of Property Act as amended by Act XX of It also affirms the view taken by us in our <ORG> decision observed thus There is a well established distinction between cases in which a person who has a pre existing interest in property pays off a prior charge on that property for the protection of his own interest and cases in which a person acquires an interest in property only by reason of his advancing money to pay off an existing mortgage debt It seems to me that the first clause of Section must be held to relate to the first type of cases above referred to and the third clause to the second type Considerable reliance was placed upon certain decisions of <ORG> and the interpretation placed upon them by our <ORG> and other <ORG>s The limit of the rule as enunciated therein is thus explained by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> A A purchaser who took a conveyance purporting to be free from encumbrances could not set up a mortgage which had been paid off out of the purchase money against an encumbrance subsequent in date of which he had constructive notice In dealing with this he observed the presumption was the other way remarking that if there was no reason for keeping it alive equity would in the absence of any declaration of his intention destroy it but if there was a reason for keeping it alive equity would not destroy it According to <NAME> <NAME> Ch a purchaser who pays off a charge must show an intention to keep it alive if he wishes to prevent its merger and such an intention was shown in that case Though the money was expressly borrowed for the purpose of paying off the prior mortgage their Lordships negatived the right of subrogation In that case a person in execution of a money decree purchased in <ORG> auction a certain property which was admittedly subject to more than one mortgage What was his intention If there is no express evidence of it what intention should be ascribed to him In the familiar instance of a tenant for life paying off a charge upon the inheritance he is assumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to have intended to keep the charge alive Their Lordships therefore treated the case of a purchaser of an equity of redemption in exactly the same position as a life tenant that is a person having an existing interest in the property and discharging a prior mortgage by reason of such an existing interest and not being under a personal liability to pay the charge or being under a contractual liability to pay the encumbrance Prima facie therefore as stated by <NAME> in his book on Mortgages Section If the money be paid by one who has assumed the duty of paying the debt either by contract with the mortgagor or with those who may have succeeded to his rights this must be taken as regards other subsequent interests as a payment and as the payment was in pursuance of his agreement it may be regarded as made with the mortgagor money Even in such cases where from the terms of the mortgage deed or purchase deed it is clear that the intention to keep alive a charge is inconsistent with the real intention of the parties it would not be kept alive because the mortgagee or purchaser finds it would have been better for him to have kept the charge alive That case was one in which the mortgagee had not an existing interest but acquired an interest in consideration of certain money paid to the mortgagor and prima facie the money so paid to the mortgagor would be the money of the mortgagor with which the prior mortgage would have been redeemed Both these cases illustrate the distinction between the case of a person having an existing interest and the case of a person acquiring an interest The sections gave effect to the recognition of the principle that a person having an existing interest and not being under personal or contractual liability to pay an encumbrance is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of a prior encumbrance which is discharged Section provides for the case of a co mortgagor Section provides for the case of a union of interests that is the case of an incumbrancer becoming owner of the property It was applied also to the case of a purchaser of equity of redemption discharging a prior encumbrance It will be seen from the language of Section that it is a statutory right and the <ORG> do not go into the question whether it was for the benefit of the subsequent mortgagee to keep the prior mortgage alive or not the presumption which was automatically raised in such cases in England was recognised as a statutory right In the case of a person who advances money for the purpose of paying off a mortgage and takes a mortgage or sale the principle would be that prima facie the prior mortgage is discharged unless there is an agreement that it should be kept alive or the mortgagee or the vendee shows that there is some reason for presuming or implying such an agreement in his favour as the subsistence of an intermediate incumbrance that is the onus is on him to prove it The presumption and onus are not the same as in the two classes of cases that is in the case where a person having an existing interest discharges a prior mortgage and a person acquiring an interest discharges a mortgage The result of the case law in regard to presumption and onus in cases where a charge is not discharged by a mortgagor and in the absence of an expression of intention or an express agreement to have the charge kept alive may be summarised thus If a charge is paid off by a tenant for life he retains the benefit of it against the inheritance at It appears to me that it would more appropriately come under the next class of cases Equity would in the absence of any declaration of his intention destroy it but if there was a reason for keeping it alive such as the existence of another encumbrance equity would not destroy it If he pays the charge created by his predecessor the presumption is merger but he can keep it alive or if there is an intermediate incumbrance or other circumstances which will have to be proved a rebutting presumption will be made in his favour Where there is no intermediate incumbrance or any other circumstances which would raise an equity in his favour the original presumption that the mortgage is extinguished will not give place to a rebutting presumption in his favour and the onus is on him to prove that there was an express agreement to keep the mortgage alive A question arose whether the mortgage in favour of <NAME> had priority over an attachment of property which came into effect before the date of the mortgage Therefore their Lordships recognised that though the money would prima facie become the money of the mortgagor as in the Calcutta case as the money was paid in performance of an agreement with the mortgagee it should be kept alive It would have been very easy for their Lordships to apply the rule under Section of the Transfer of Property Act by treating <NAME> as a second mortgagee but they would not apply that section because that section was intended to relate only to a person having an existing interest in the property and discharging a prior mortgage out of his own money without being under a stipulation with the mortgagor to discharge it from and out of the consideration money for his mortgage Therefore the distinction between a person having an existing right and the person acquiring an interest was kept in view by their Lordships of <ORG> there was a mortgage in favour of one <NAME> on th February which was effected for the purpose of discharging a zerpeshgi debt dated th November It is also significant that their Lordships did not apply Section of the Transfer of Property Act but invoked the principle of equity thus again illustrating the distinction between a person having an existing interest and a person acquiring an interest <NAME> does recognise that and Calcutta cases were based on conventional subrogation and that Section of the Transfer of Property Act would not apply to cases where a person is under a contractual liability to discharge a mortgage As remarked by <NAME> Section i deals with the case of a person having an existing interest and Section iii deals with the case where under the previous state of the law the right of subrogation was invoked on the doctrine of conventional subrogation This follows from the plain language of the section and there is very good reason why the <ORG> adopted this view In the case of a person having an existing interest there is no need to resort to any agreement express or implied and Section of the Transfer of Property Act before the amendment gave partial recognition in favour of second and subsequent mortgagees and Section i only extended the said principle In other cases the <ORG> had to go into questions of intention in certain cases coming to the conclusion that there was an intention to keep the mortgage alive and in certain other cases that there was no such intention The <ORG> therefore enacted the rule in Section iii as it is always open to a person who advances money to enter into an agreement The legislature does give the benefit of the principle of subrogation even in such cases but the legislature requires that the person intended to take advantage of the benefit must comply with certain requirements the requirements being a registered instrument for keeping alive the prior mortgage which can always be done even by the very transaction sale or mortgage under which the money was advanced by making a declaration that it was agreed between the parties that the prior mortgage was intended to be kept alive It is contended by Mr <NAME> that the words in Clause iii a person who has advanced money to a mortgagor money with which the mortgage has been redeemed are only intended to cover the case of a person who merely lends money without stipulating for any security as such a person cannot in law acquire any right of subrogation but for the statutory provision There is no warrant for placing such a narrow construction What is contemplated by the section is the receipt of money by a mortgagor for the discharge of a mortgage and the redemption of such a mortgage with that money But as and by way of equity an agreement was inferred in cases where there is no express agreement for keeping the mortgage alive As the inference of such an intention is dependent upon a number of circumstances and to avoid <ORG> going into them Clause was enacted to confer a statutory right in such cases provided the person seeking the benefit of it fulfils the conditions mentioned in the section The Court below has answered this question in the negative Persons entitled to institute a suit for redemption fall into three classes only any person who has an interest in or charge upon the property mortgaged or an interest in or charge upon the right to redeem any surety for payment of the mortgage debt or a part thereof any creditor of the mortgagor who in a suit for administration of his estate has obtained a decree for sale of the mortgaged property They were not persons entitled to sue for redemption when they purchased property burdened with a mortgage debt A person not entitled to sue for redemption who purchases property subject to mortgage becomes ipso facto a person entitled to sue for redemption which is the very reverse of saying that he is subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee A person not entitled to sue for redemption who buys mortgaged property that is advances money to the mortgagor with which the mortgage is redeemed may however contract with the mortgagor for the right to be subrogated to the mortgagee whose mortgage has been redeemed I agree with my learned brother that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs
