It appears that <ORG> had information that the appellants had not utilised the imported white cardboard for the purpose for which it was allowed to be imported but that they had exported only locally made packing materials However since the goods had already been exported the appellants who had contravened Section i of the <ORG> Act read with Section ibid with deliberate intent to evade <ORG> duty on the imported white cardboard had thereby rendered themselves liable to a penalty under Section ibid After holding adjudication proceedings the Collector of <ORG> Cochin passed an order dated holding that the appellants had failed to comply with the conditions specified in Notification No and ordering them to pay customs duty of Rs The evidence produced by the appellants to show that the imported cardboard had been converted into cartons was rejected by the Collector stating that there was nothing to prove that the said cartons were made only out of the imported material At this stage we may with advantage notice some of the relevant provisions Another was that the exempt materials should be used in the manufacture of such resultant products and in such factories as were specified in the <ORG> Notification No dated exempted the goods specified in the schedule to the notification imported against an Advance Licence being materials required to be imported for the purpose of manufacture of goods or replenishment of the materials used in the manufacture of goods or both for executing one or more export orders from customs duty There were several conditions laid down including the one about <ORG> However this condition was not applicable to exempt materials which are imported for replenishment of the materials used in the manufacture of goods One is that the imported materials were allowed to be imported duty free not only for the manufacture of specified goods for export but also for replenishment of the materials used in the manufacture of such goods At the outset the learned Counsel for the appellants made certain submissions challenging the validity of the show cause notice issued to the appellants and the jurisdiction of the Collector of <ORG> Cochin to adjudicate upon the proceedings initiated thereunder First the show cause notice for payment of duties not levied short levied or erroneously refunded in a case involving collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts by the importer or exporter or his agent or employee enabling the <ORG> to invoke an extended period of five years instead of the usual period of six months was to be issued by the Collector In the present instance the show cause notice was issued by the Assistant Collector though cause was required to be shown to the Collector The second preliminary submission of <NAME> was that the import having been effected at Madras Port the Collector of <ORG> Cochin had no jurisdiction to demand duty on the goods Taking first the question of the Cochin Collector jurisdiction to demand duty in the present case we have to note that the import of the goods took place at Madras A bond legal undertaking for complying with the conditions specified in the notification was to be executed before such authority as may be approved by the Central Government The Cochin Collector however seems to have assumed jurisdiction to deal with the matter himself The <ORG> has not produced any notification or other legal provision none has been placed before us under which the Cochin Collector was conferred jurisdiction to demand duty in respect of goods imported at Madras and cleared by the Madras customs either generally or in this particular case <ORG> has issued notifications under Section of the <ORG> Act appointing Collectors of <ORG> and lower officers for different jurisdictions In terms of these notifications the respective jurisdiction of the Collectors have been clearly spelt out see for example Notification No Cus Notification No dated as amended appoints the Collector of <ORG> and <ORG> Cochin as the Collector of <ORG> in his jurisdiction Evidently it does not extend to Madras Port for which the Collector is the Collector of <ORG> Madras vide Notification No dated There are of course a few officers appointed as Collectors with all India jurisdiction such as the Director of Revenue Intelligence but the Collector of <ORG> Cochin is not one among them In these circumstances we hold that the Collector of <ORG> Cochin had no jurisdiction to demand duty in the present case and consequently we set aside the demand However the show cause notice called upon the appellants to explain why in the circumstances stated in the notice a penalty should not be imposed on them under Section of the <ORG> Act We have therefore to proceed on the basis that penalty has in fact been imposed under Section though it is not clearly stated so It has not been shown before us that in respect of the exported goods there was any such prohibition This provision has no application to the present case Dutiable goods in this context evidently means goods liable to export duty This provision again has no application Perhaps there are separate proceedings in this regard In the view we have taken there is no need to go into the other submissions made before us The result is that the impugned order is set aside and the appeal is allowed
