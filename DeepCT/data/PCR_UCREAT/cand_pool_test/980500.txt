By the impugned judgment dated th December in A No of the learned Judges of <ORG> of <ORG> reversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge Writ Petition filed by some of the candidates was rejected by <ORG> on the ground of laches and also for the reason that the selection had to be broad based A similar petition was filed by the present respondents and it was dismissed by the learned Single Judge which was reversed by the impugned judgment The question which arises in the present appeal is whether or not candidates who were fully qualified to be appointed as Junior Engineers on the dates of interview but whose results had not been declared on the dates of submission of their applications were entitled to be considered for appointment to the post of Junior Engineer By that day the appellants and the respondents had submitted their applications The respondents challenge against the selection of the appellants did not appeal to either of the two Single Judges who heard the Writ Petitions filed by some of the respondents Attested copies of the following certificates original to be produced at the time of interview before <ORG> should be attached with the application Academic Technical Examination Certificate Counsel for the respondents submits that rule has no application to the instant case for the selection was not made by <ORG> Accordingly we set aside the impugned judgment of <ORG> and restore that of the learned Single Judge However we make no order as to costs However we do not make any order as to costs Although I agree with Brother <NAME> that the appeals deserve to be allowed and the seniority of the appellants and respondents who were selected as Junior Engineers in had to be determined by the marks they secured in the interview conducted by <ORG> but with profound respect in my opinion they are entitled to this relief not as a matter of law but due to equitable considerations arising in peculiar facts and circumstances of the case Candidates who fulfil the qualifications prescribed for appointment to the costs advertised shall alone be eligible for being called for interview and others need not therefore apply It can be divided in three parts If the notification would have stopped there probably much could be said in favour of the appellants but the second part required every candidate to file authenticated copy of the certificate in proof of each of the conditions Nor can the notification inviting applications be construed in light of what was stated by the <ORG> in the affidavit filed by it in <ORG> May be no one from those who were prevented from applying due to unawareness of the intention of <ORG> which came to light in <ORG> only could challenge the selection yet it is the duty of the <ORG> under the Constitution once it is apprised of true facts to make the <ORG> act fairly I have therefore grave doubt if rules framed by <ORG> could be utilised for purposes of construing the notification issued by the department of Government which has separate set of rules Having dealt with legal aspect it is necessary to be stated that it transpired from the records which were produced by the learned Counsel for State of Jammu Kashmir that a few days before the interview of first batch of candidates was to commence the result of was announced The matter was examined thereafter and after ascertaining from the <ORG> that such practice was prevalent a decision was taken by the appropriate authority to follow the same Therefore it was not a case where the rule of the <ORG> need be extended by analogy but factually the appropriate authority had taken decision to follow the same From the record it appeared that the <ORG> before issuing interview letters had taken a decision that those candidates who were not qualified were not entitled to be called What has persuaded me however to allow the appeals is not that there was no illegality in calling the appellants for interview or that the <ORG> was justified in taking the decision to follow the practice of <ORG> but similar claim of the respondents had been rejected earlier by <ORG> and by the time it was allowed more than ten years had elapsed since the examination was held and selection was made Once the appellants were held to be eligible may be not strictly under law but on equitable considerations then it was wholly unjust to place them junior and under those who in the same examination secured lesser marks I would therefore in agreement with Brother <NAME> allow the appeals set aside the order passed by <ORG> and restore that of the Single Judge
