The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is a petit ion under article of the Constitution praying for a writ in the nature of certiorari for calling up the records of certain criminal proceedings started against the petitioner by the Special judge <ORG> Delhi and for quashing the safe on the ground that these proceedings are without jurisdiction having been commenced in violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed under article of the Constitution Certain imputations of misbehaviour by the petitioner while holding offices of various descriptions under <ORG> came to the notice of <ORG> and the latter being satisfied that there were prima facie good grounds for making an enquiry directed a formal and public enquiry to be made as to the truth or falsity of the allegations made Against the petitioner in accordance with the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act of The first charge alleged that the petitioner was guilty of misbehaviour inasmuch as he showed undue favour to Messrs Opportunity was given to the petitioner by this letter in terms of article of the Constitution to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him and it was stated that any representation which he might desire to make would be taken into consideration before the final order was passed point for our consideration is whether in the events that have happened in this case there has been a violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner under article of the Constitution which would justify the issue of a writ for enforcement of the same The scope and meaning of the guarantee implied in The roots of the principle which this clause enacts are to be found in the well established rule of English law which finds expression in the maxim Nemo debet bis vexari a man must not be put twice in peril for the same offence The corresponding provision in the Federal Constitution of the A is contained in the Fifth Amendment which provides inter alia Nor shall any person be subjected for the same offence to be put twice in jeopardy of life and limb Although these were the materials which formed the background of the guarantee of the fundamental right given in article of the Constitution the ambit and contents of the guarantee as this court pointed out in the case referred to above are much narrower than those of the common law rule in England or the doctrine of double jeopardy in the American This has been left to be regulated by the general law of the land It has also been held by this court in <NAME> case that the language of article and the words actually used in it afford a clear indication that the proceedings in connection with the prosecution and punishment of a person must be in the nature of a criminal proceeding before a court of law or judicial tribunal and not before a tribunal which entertains a departmental or an administrative enquiry even though set up by a statute but which is not required by law to try a matter judicially and on legal evidence It was held that such proceedings were not Prosecution nor the order of confiscation a punishment within the meaning of article inasmuch as the <ORG> authority was not a court or a judicial tribunal and merely exercised administrative powers vested in him for revenue purposes We will assume for our present purpose that the allegations upon which these charges are based are substantially the same which formed the subject matter of enquiry under the Public Servants Inquiries Act of He had to adjudicate on the charges judicially on evidence recorded on oath which he was authorised by law to administer The prosecution was conducted by a prosecutor appointed under the Act charges were read out to the accused person and his plea was taken witnesses on both sides were examined on oath and they were cross examined and re examined The Commissioner had all the powers of a court he could summon witnesses compel production of relevant documents and punish people for contempt At the close of the enquiry the Commissioner did record his finding against the petitioner on some of the charges He had undoubtedly no power to impose any punishment and had only to forward his report to the Government It is true that the Commissioner appointed to make an enquiry under Act XXXVII of is invested with some of the powers of a court particularly in the matter of summoning witnesses and compelling the production of documents and the report which he has to make has to be made on legal evidence adduced under sanction of oath and tested by cross examination It is a well established principle of English law that except where it is otherwise provided by a statute all public officers and servants of the <ORG> hold their appointments at the pleasure of the <ORG> The object of the Act as stated in the preamble was to regulate enquiry into the behaviour of public servants not removal from service without the sanction of the <ORG> The enquiry was quite optional with the <ORG> and did not affect in any way the powers of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at pleasure and this was expressly provided by section of the Act the wording of which is as follows Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the authority of the <ORG> to Sub section of section of the Government of India Act runs as follows Subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder every person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed Thus one restriction imposed by this section upon the unfettered right of the Government to dismiss its servants at its pleasure was that no servant could be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed Rule which finds a place in the same chapter lays down the procedure to be followed before passing an order of dismissal removal or reduction in rank against any member of the service No such order shall be passed unless the person concerned has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action against him and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act of or in a less formal and less public manner as is provided for in the rule itself These rules have no statutory force and it was held by <ORG> that when an officer was dismissed from service without complying with the provisions of these rules he had no right of action against the <ORG> In other words the rules which were not incorporated in a statute did not impose any legal restriction upon the right of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at pleasure The position was altered to some extent in the Government of India Act and in addition to the restriction imposed by section of the Government of India Act that a civil servant could not be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed a further statutory provision was made that a civil servant could not be dismissed or reduced in rank unless the person concerned was given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him before reduction in rank and thus in all the three cases which are covered by rule of the Civil Services Rules a civil servant has now a constitutional right to claim a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him As the law stands at present the only purpose for which an enquiry under Act XXXVII of could be made is to help the <ORG> to come to a definite conclusion regarding the misbehaviour of a public servant and thus enable it to determine provisionary the punishment which should be imposed upon him prior to giving him a reasonable opportunity of showing cause as is required under article of the Constitution It may be pointed out that the words prosecution and punishment have no fixed connotation and they are susceptible of both a wider and a narrower meaning but in article both these words have been used with reference to an offence and the word offence has to be taken in the sense in which it is used in the General Clauses Act as meaning I an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force Code or the Prevention of Corruption Act and he has absolutely no jurisdiction to do so As the Commissioner has to form his opinion upon legal evidence he has been given the power to summon witnesses administer oath to then and also to compel production of relevant documents There is no to express any power in the Commissioner even opinion about punishment and section only contemplates such order as the <ORG> can pass in its capacity as employer in respect to servants employed by it A somewhat analogous case would be that of a member of the <ORG> whose name is struck off the rolls on grounds of professional misconduct in exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction by the proper authority The learned Attorney General raised a point before us that the test of the guarantee under article is whether the person has been tried and punished not for the same act but for the same offence and his contention is that the offences here are different though they may arise out of the same acts He had varied social and cultural interests which are quite well known and it is hardly necessary to refer to them His full grasp of facts his thorough knowledge of law and his quick prception of the real points in a case were of great assistance to us in dealing with the many complicated questions that arose for determination in this <ORG> Members of the <ORG> will never forget the keen practical sense which he brought to bear on all questions that came before him the patience with which he heard them and the invariable kindness he showed to them
