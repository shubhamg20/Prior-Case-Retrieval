Constitution of India Schedule VII List Entry List ll Entries and Scope of <ORG> legislature whether competent to enact a law with respect to intoxication liquors or for levying excise duty on alcoholic requirements for human consumption Doctrine of occupied field Application of lncidental encroachment on forbidden field Whether affects competence of legislature to enact law Necessity for examination of the scheme of both enactments Charging section of statute index to the real character of tax Tax and Fee Distinction between Quid pro quo stricto sensu Whether sine qua non of fee Words and Phrases Shall have due regard to Meaning of HEADNOTE The appellants who were manufacturers of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol challenged the constitutional validity in their writ petitions under Art and of the Kerala Spiritious Preparations Rules on the ground that <ORG> had no power to enact a law relating to medicinal and toilet preparations as the topic of the legislation was within the exclusive domain of <ORG> under Entry List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and also on the ground that they were violative of Art <ORG> dismissed the writ petition holding that there was no conflict between the impugned provisions and the <ORG> law i the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Act or the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Rules framed thereunder as they dealt with different subjects In the appeal and the special leave petition to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants The <ORG> <ORG> had no legislative competence to enact the impugned provisions because the field was occupied by the provisions of The Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Act The <ORG> Act and the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Rules the <ORG> Rules and alternatively the impugned provisions are violative of the fundamental right guaranteed in Art Drugs and Pharmaceuticals having been declared by <ORG> under of the Industries Development and Regulation Act to be a scheduled industry being item of the First Schedule thereof the power of <ORG> to make a law in respect of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol was taken away The power to restrict the quantity of ayurvedic asavas and arishtas in which alcohol is self generated in the process of manufacture having regard to the total requirement of such medicinal preparations for consumption or use in the <ORG> is an unreasonable restriction on The fundamental right to carry on trade or business guaranteed under An as there was demand for such medicinal preparations not only in The <ORG> but throughout the country While the main purpose of the impugned Act is to consolidate the law relating to manufacture sale and possession of intoxicating liquors and intoxicating drugs a subject which falls under Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule the main object of the <ORG> Act is lo provide for the levy and collection of duties of excise on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol falling under Entry List I i ii It is the charging section which gives the true index to the real character of a tax Some of the impugned provisions may be almost similar to some of the provisions of the <ORG> Rules but that does not imply that <ORG> had no competence to enact the provisions The <ORG> Legislation is confined to intoxicating liquor that is to ensure proper utilisation of rectified spirit in the manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations and therefore within the powers granted to <ORG> under Entry List II A iv The enumeration of intoxicating liqour in Entry List II confers exclusive power to the <ORG> to legislate in respect of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol A necessary corollary of the doctrine of pith and substance is that once it is found that in pith and substance the impugned Act is a law on a permitted field any incidental encroachment on a forbidden field does not affect the competence of the legislature to enact the law viii No citizen has any fundamental right guaranteed under Art The restrictions imposed by section as to the alcoholic content of medicinal and toilet preparations and the requirement that they shall not be manufactured except and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence granted by him are nothing but reasonable restrictions within the meaning of Art There is no warrant for the submission that the framing of such an incidental provision like of the <ORG> Rules takes away the <ORG> power to recover supervisory charges from the licensee iii No one has a fundamental right to the supply of rectified spirit which is an intoxicating liquor To claim the privilege he must comply with the conditions prescribed If one of the conditions is the payment of cost of establishment under section of the Act read with rule of the <ORG> Rules the manufacturer of such preparations must necessarily bear the burden the licensee gets services in return in lieu of such payment The restriction imposed by section A of the Act as to the quantity of medicinal preparations to be manufactured relate not only to preparations to which alcohol is added but also to medicinal preparations in which alcohol is self generated From the judgment and order dated nd January of <ORG> in original Petition No of The main question in the appeal is as to the legislative competence of the <ORG> to enact a law relating to medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol under Entry List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution They filed a writ petition in <ORG> complaining that they were entitled to the supply of alcohol free of duty for the manufacture of their medicinal and toilet preparations under of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations A Excise Duties Rules hereinafter referred to as the Central Rules and of the Kerala Rectified Spirit Rules and challenged the validity of the impugned provisions mainly on the ground that <ORG> has no power to enact the law relating to medicinal and toilet preparations as the topic of legislation is within the exclusive domain of <ORG> under Entry List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution <ORG> held that there was no conflict between the impugned provisions and the Central law as they dealt with different subjects Before this Court the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions was mainly challenged on these grounds namely I The State <ORG> had no legislative competence to enact the impugned provisions because the field was occupied by the provisions of the A Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Act the Central Act and the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Rules the Central Rules and alternatively the impugned provisions are violative of the fundamental right guaranteed in Art The <ORG> having made a declaration in of the Industries Development and Regulation Act declaring Drugs and Pharmaceuticals to be a scheduled industry being item of the First Schedule thereof the power of <ORG> to make a law in respect of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol is taken away It is submitted that <ORG> has no power to make any such law imposing restrictions on a person carrying on the business of manufacture and sale of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol in as much as the matter relates to an occupied field There is no merit in these contentions In order to appreciate the contention regarding the applicability of the doctrine of occupied field it is necessary to examine the scheme of both the enactments No liquor or intoxicating drug shall be sold with out a licence from the Commissioner provided that a person having the right to the toddy drawn from any tree may sell the same without a licence to a person licensed to manufacture or sell toddy under this Act A duty of excise or luxury tax or both shall if the Government so direct be levied on all liquor and intoxicating drugs issued from a distillery brewery winery or other manufactory or warehouse licensed or established under section or section or The Act is clearly relatable to the State power to make a law on the topics of legislation covered by Entries and List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which read as under Duties of excise on the following goods manufactured or produced in the <ORG> and countervailing duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods manufactured or produced elsewhere in India a alcoholic liquors for human consumption opium Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics but not including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub paragraph of this entry In the light of experience gained there was necessity to achieve a synthesis from a vast body of existing rules and regulations in force in the States having regard to the sole object of the measure namely to bring about uniform treatment in excise matters Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except a alcoholic liquors for human consumption opium Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics but including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub paragraph of this entry Section is the charging section which levies duties of excise on all dutiable goods manufactured in India and also lays down the mode of collection of the said duties There shall be levied duties of excise at the rates specified in the Schedule on all dutiable goods manufactured in India Section empowers <ORG> to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act and sub thereof specifies the various matters in respect of which such rules may be made It is the charging section which gives the true index to the a real character of a tax Similarly some of the impugned provisions may be almost similar to some of the provisions of the <ORG> Rules but that that does not imply that <ORG> had no competence to enact the provisions It is sufficient to say upon the first ground that the impugned legislation is confined to intoxicating liquor that is to ensure proper utilisation of rectified spirit in the manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations and therefore within the powers granted to <ORG> under Entry List II The answer is that the enumeration of intoxicating liquor in Entry List II confers exclusive power to the <ORG> to legislate in respect of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol A necessary corollary of the doctrine of pith and substance is that once it is found that in pith and substance the impugned Act is a law on a permitted field any incidental encroachment on a forbidden field does not affect the competence of the legislature to enact the law There the Court was concerned with the question whether of the Medical Preparations and Spirituous Rules Fasli framed under the Hyderabad Abkari Act Fasli which provided that the expenses of the establishment for the supervision of the work shall be borne by the pharmaceutical laboratory licensee as per the decision of the Commissioner of Excise was still enforceable having regard to of the Central Act and of the Central Rules While repelling the contention that could still be good law as it was meant to carry out the general law relating to alcohol and intoxicating drugs the <ORG> pointed out that the Central Rules make no provision for recovery of supervisory charges the intention being that the duty under the Act would cover all expenses for enforcing it and observed We are of opinion that there is no force hl this contention either It is not disputed by the appellants that the impugned Act does not levy a duty of excise on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol but they contend that whatever be the intention <ORG> had in fact encroached upon an occupied field No citizen has any fundamental right guaranteed under Art The general test for determining what medicinal preparations containing alcohol are capable of being misused and therefore must be considered intoxicating within the meaning of the term intoxicating liquor is the capability of the article in question tor use as a beverage As a corollary it must result in the consequence that in the case of medicinal and toilet preparations which are capable of being misused as alcoholic beverages or which are not bona fide medicinal preparations in the opinion of <ORG> the Commissioner may totally prohibit the manufacture of such pre parations As regards the second ground the contention that <ORG> having made the requisite declaration in of the Industries Development and Regulation Act declaring drugs and pharmaceuticals to be a scheduled industry being item of Schedule I thereof <ORG> was denuded of its competence to enact the impugned provisions under Entry List II cannot be accepted But subject to such erosion on the remainder <ORG> will still have power to legislate in respect of a declared industry without in any way trenching upon the occupied field Merely because the Central Rules made no provision for realisation of supervisory charges at the stage of manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations does not imply that the <ORG> has no power to prescribe the mode of supervision in a manufactory where preparations containing intoxicating liquor or intoxicating drugs are manufactured or to ensure proper collection of duties taxes and other dues payable under the Act or to the proper utilisation of liquor or intoxicating drug There is no warrant for the submission that the framing of such an incidental provision like of the Central Rules takes away the <ORG> power to recover supervisory charges from the licensee There still remains the question whether the levy of supervisory charges must be regarded as a fee and therefore cannot be sustained there being no quid pro quo The question came up for consideration for the first time in this <ORG> in the Commissioner Madras <NAME> of <ORG> Therein the <ORG> speaking through <NAME> quoted with approval the definition of tax given by <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> Dealing with the distinction between tax and fee the learned Judge observed It is said that the essence of taxation is compulsion that is to say it is imposed under statutory power without the tax payer consent and the payment is enforced by law A The second characteristic of tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax This is expressed by saying that the levy of tax is for the purposes of general revenue which when collected forms part of the public revenues of the <ORG> As the object of a tax is not to confer any special benefit upon any particular individual there is as it is said no element of quid pro quo between the tax payer and the public authority Coming now to fees a fee is generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some <ORG>al agency The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the <ORG> in rendering the service though in many cases the costs are arbitrarily assessed Ordinarily the fees are uniform and no account is taken of the varying abilities of different recipients to pay If as we hold a fee is regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered it is absolutely necessary that the levy of fees should on the face of the legislative provision be co related to the expenses incurred by <ORG> in rendering the services We may Din this connection refer with profit to the observations of <NAME> in his Costitutional Law to the effect It is submitted that as recognised by <NAME> him self the fact that the collections are not merged in the consolidated fund is not conclusive though that fact may enable a court to say that very important feature of a fee was present The <ORG> was considering the rate of a market fee and the question was whether there was any justification for the increase in rate from Rs There was no material placed to justify the increase in rate of the fee and therefore it partook the nature of a tax It seems obvious that If an exaction is to be classed as a duty of excise it must of course be a tax its essential distinguishing feature is that it is a tax imposed upon or in respect of or in relation to goods <NAME> <ORG> The exaction is in truth as it purports to be simply a fee payable as a condition of a right to carry on a business No one has a fundamental right to the supply of rectified spirit which is an intoxicating liquor It was clearly indicated that the burden of the cost of supervisory charges must fall on the manufacturer and not on the consumer because there was no co relationship between the levy of fee and the services rendered Further though there was a double duty on the manufacturer as well as the consumer the Court did not strike down the levy on the consumer because it was observed that the question of co relationship between the services rendered and the fee levied is essentially a question of fact emphasis added The <ORG> then went into the question whether there was any corelationship between the services rendered and the fee levied and whether the levy in question was not disproportionate to the value of the services rendered by the <ORG> and observed In the opinion of <ORG> the subsequent transfer of denatured spirit and possession of the same in the hands of various persons such as whole sale dealer retail dealer or other manufacturers also requires close and effective supervision because of the risk of the denatured spirit being converted into palatable liquor and thus evading heavy duty It is merely protecting its own rights Further in this case the <ORG> which was in a position to place material before the <ORG> to show what services had been rendered by it to the appellant and other similar licensees the costs or at any rate the probable costs that can be said to have been incurred for rendering those services and the amount realised as fees has failed to do so Nevertheless the <ORG> remitted the matter to the High <ORG> with a direction that opportunity be given to the <ORG> to place material to show that the value of the services rendered has reasonable co relationship with the fee charged There is a broad co relationship between the fee collected and the cost of the establishment The rate at which the cost of establishment is to be paid by the licensee shall be fixed by the Commissioner from time to time and intimated to the licensee in writing There is admittedly no provision made in the Central Rules for the recover of supervisor charges perhaps because as the Court Observed in <ORG> case A supra it was felt that the duty on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol would be sufficient to defray the cost of such supervision The last ground on which the appellants took their stand is even less tenable In the connected Special Leave Petition the petitioner <NAME> Managing Trustee Arya Vaidyasala Kottakkal who is engaged in the business of manufacture for sale of ayurvedic medicinal preparations challenges the validity of ss A A and A of the Act and rr As regards the Rules it was generally said that they constitute unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed under Art of the constitution is concerned it is urged that there is demand for the petitioner medicinal preparations not only in the <ORG> but throughout the country and to limit the quantity to be manufactured taking into account the requirements of the <ORG> alone is but an abridgment on the freedom of inter <ORG> trade and commerce As already stated the expression shall have regard to as interpreted by <ORG> in the <NAME> of <NAME> case supra means shall take into consideration
