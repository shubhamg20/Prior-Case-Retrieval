It was contended on his behalf that does not authorise placing a prisoner under sentence of death in solitary confinement and that the jail authority could not arrogate to itself the power to impose such punishment under the garb of giving effect to On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the section merely permits statutory segregation for safety of the prisoner in the prisoner own interest and that instead of striking down the provision the <ORG> should adopt a course of so reading down the section as to denude it of its ugly inhuman features The petitioner in of contended that of the Prisons Act which confers unguided uncanalised and arbitrary powers on the Superintendent to confine a prisoner in irons is ultra vires Arts For example a man of profession who is convicted would stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence but the Constitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment Likewise even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Art that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law Unless special circumstances exist even in cases where a person is kept in a cell apart from other prisoners with day and night watch he must be within the sight an sound of other prisoners and be able to take food in their company But as the prisoner is not to be kept in solitary confinement and the custody in which he is kept under would prelude detention in solitary confinement there is no chance of imposing a second punishment upon him and therefore is not violative of Art There is no warrant for an implicit belief that every prisoner under sentence of death is necessarily violent or dangerous requiring his segregation The power under can be exercised only for reasons and considerations which are germane to the objective of the statute viz safe custody of the prisoner which takes in considerations regarding the character and propensities of the prisoner The nature and length of sentence or the magnitude of the crime committed by the prisoner are not relevant for the purpose of determining that question This applies to cases as much of prison punishment as of safety fetters Assuming that the High <ORG> has confirmed that death sentence or has de novo imposed death sentence even then there is quite a likelihood of an appeal to the Supreme <ORG> and when an appeal pends against a conviction and sentence in regard to an offence punishable with death sentence such death sentence even if confirmed by the High <ORG> shall not work itself until the Supreme <ORG> has pronounced judgment Articles and provide for commutation of death sentence even like sections and Cr Functionally speaking the court has a distinctive duty to reform prison practices and to inject constitutional consciousness into the system Article of the Constitution also provides for an appeal to the Supreme <ORG> in certain cases where the High <ORG> has awarded death penalty There are compelling reasons that a narrow construction should be put on Sec A prisoner has also the right to make mercy petitions to the Governor or the president as the case may be The expression life as used in Article means something more than mere animal existence and the inhibition against is deprivation extends to all those limits and faculties by which life is enjoyed there is no provision for substantive due process in the Indian Constitution There is a fundamental distinction between solitary confinement imposed I punishment or an additional punishment and confinement of prisoner under sentence of death in a separate cell for the purpose of preventing his suicide or escape and for ensuring the presence of the prisoner on the day appointed for execution The protection of whatever liberties are left inside the jail demand that they cannot be taken away arbitrarily and without the procedure established by laws Section is ultra vires of Articles and because it allows the Jail authorities to put irons on the personal assessments as to the character of prisoners The section thereby gives complete power to pick and choose prisoners for Section of the Prison Act and paragraph of the Jail Manual which restrict personal liberty in so far as they abridge and take away fundamental rights under Article will have to meet the challenge of that Article otherwise it is not a valid law Paragraph of the Manual and section of the Prison ACT which impose inhuman and cruel restrictions and subjects the petitioner to Torture more than those who are punished for jail offences are not laws when judged from the evolving standards of decency and present concept of civilization there is a presumption that the legislature intends to respect rules of international law and country inter national obligations The expressions dangerous prisoners or unsafe prisoners has a definite and well recognised connotation in the context of prison legislation prison literature A guiding principle has been laid down by section which has the effect of limiting the application of the provision to a particular category of persons I There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality of statutes It is not open to the petitioner to challenge section on the ground that power can be exercised with reference to the state of prison inasmuch as no action based on that part of the provisions is taken against the petitioner I There is no provision in our Constitution corresponding to VIII Amendment of the Constitution There is also no provision for substantive due process in the Indian Constitution The jurisdictional reach and range of this <ORG> writ to hold prison caprice and cruelty in constitutional leash is incontestable but teasing intrusion into administrative discretion is legal anathema absent breaches of constitutional rights or prescribed procedures Where the court insisted on civilized standards of humane decency and interdicted the subhuman condition which could only serve to destroy completely the spirit and undermine the sanity of the prisoner who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> in <NAME> observed <ORG>s cannot of course abdicate their constitutional responsibility to delineate and protect fundamental liberties But when the issue involves a regulation limiting one of several means of communication by an inmate the institutional objectives furthered by that regulation and the measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials in their attempt to serve these interests are relevant in gauging the validity of the regulation in his dissenting view stated prisioners are still persons entitled to all constitutional rights unless their liberty has been constitutional by curtailed by procedures that satisfy all the requirements of due process emphasis added But though his rights may be diminished by environment prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he is imprisoned for crime Mr Justice <NAME> expressed himself explicitly I have previously stated my view that a prisoner does not shed his basic constitutional rights at the prison Gate and I fully support the court holding that the interest of inmates is freedom from imposition of serious discipline is a liberty entitled to due process protection Mr Justice <NAME> again a dissenter asserted Every prisoner liberty i of course circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement but his interest in the limited liberty left to him is then only the more substantial Conviction of a crime does not render one a nonperson whose rights are subject to the within of the prison administration and therefore the imposition of any serious punishment within the prison system requires procedural safeguards of course a bearing need not be held before a prisoner is subjected to some minor deprivation such as an evening loss of television privileges The Judge finds that the beating of the detenus that took place on the night of February was a premeditated pre planned and deliberate one and not undertaken on the spur of the moment either because of any provocation offered by the detenus to go into the cells as contended by the jail officials other lurid judicial reports from other States also have appeared The luminous guideline on <ORG> states sets our sight high Legislation both statutory and constitutional is enacted it is true from an experience of evils but its general language should not therefore be necessarily confined to the form that civil had therefore taken Time works changes brings into existence new conditions and purposes Therefore a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth They are not ephemeral enactments designed to meet passing occasions They are to use the words of Chief Justice <NAME> designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas Rights declared in the words might be lost in reality The meaning and vitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction This <ORG> in <NAME> State of Uttar Pradesh Ors and in a host of other cases has lent precedential support for this proposition where that process renders a statute constitutional There is no force in the petition which is hereby dismissed It is also true that there was no separate room for the petitioner to take a bath in or to answer calls of nature Art insists upon procedure established by law before any person can be denuded of his freedom of locomotion If such prisoners are allowed to remain outside the cells then there is every possibility of incidents of assaults etc the solitary has survived judicial scrutiny it is a fortiori case in India where there is no constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment The necessary sequitur is that even a person under death sentence has human rights which are non negotiable and even a dangerous prisoner standing trial has basic liberties which cannot be bartered away The inhibition against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed equally prohibits the mutilation of the body by the amputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an eye or the destruction of any other organ of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world As the twin cases unfold the facts we have to test the contentions of law on this broader basis courts which sign citizens into prisons have an onerous duty to ensure that during detention and subject to the Constitution freedom from torture belongs to the detenu <NAME> once said that if in the last moment before being executed a man however brave were given the alternative of spending the rest of his numbered days on the top of a bare rock with only enough space to sit on it he would choose it with relief Likewise the facile statement that men in the death row are so desperate that they will commit more murders if facility offers itself lacks rational appeal When I first saw it I just couldn believe it In short there was nothing just four walls and room enough to take five paces not strides from one end of the cell to the other Does this stand to reason A woman who coldly poisons all her crying children to death to elope with a paramour may be guilty of maniacal murder and perhaps may be awarded death sentence I believe that very few men are capable of estimating the immense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment prolonged for years inflicts upon the sufferers and in guessing at it myself and in reasoning from what I have seen written upon their faces and what to my certain knowledge they feel within I am only the more convinced that there is a depth of terrible endurance in it which none but the sufferers themselves can fathom and which no man has a right to inflict upon his fellow creatures Interviews when they do take place after three months or more are most extraordinary There is a great deal of shouting at each other and the slight human touch that might have come from the interview is entirely absent There are remarkably few attempts to escape Administration of the jail was in the hands or a staff of Assistant Jailors and clerks subordinate to the Jailor who had overall responsibility for the day to day running of the prison That it should have been established shows the absolute ignorance of criminal nature which existed at the time that it should still persist shows the present necessity for widespread popular knowledge of these matters The learned Judge observed Solitary confinement should not be ordered unless there are special features appearing in the evidence such as extreme violence or brutality in the commission of the offence Ch the power was very rarely exercised by a criminal Court If solitary confinement is a revolt against society humane essence there is no reason to permit the same punishment to be smuggled into the prison system by naming it differently For a fuller comprehension of the legal provisions and their construction we may have to quote the relevant sections and thereafter make a laboratory dissection thereof to get an understanding of the components Which make up the legislative sanction for semi solitary detention of <NAME> We reproduce the relevant portion The Superintendent may examine any person touching any such offence and determine thereupon and punish such offence by imposition of handcuffs of such pattern and weight in such manner and for such period as may be prescribed by rules made by the Governor General in Council imposition of fetters of such pattern and weight in such manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the rules made by Governor General in Council separate confinement for any period not exceeding three months Explanation Separate confinement means such confinement with or without labour as secludes a prisoner from communication with but not from sight of other prisoners and allows him not less than one hour exercise per diem and to have his meals in association with one or more other prisoners Sub section speaks of separate confinement for any period not exceeding three months There is a further explanation which to some extent softens the seclusion May be there is something wrong in the professional training and the prison culture Even there is quite a likelihood of an appeal to <ORG> and the plenary power of the highest court extends to demolition or the death sentence Where a person is sentenced to death by <ORG> and an appeal from the judgment lies to <ORG> under sub clause a or sub clause of clause of article of the Constitution <ORG> shall order the execution of the sentence to be postponed until the period allowed for preferring such appeal has expired or if an appeal is preferred within that period until such appeal is disposed of Where a sentence of death is passed or confirmed by <ORG> and the person sentenced makes an application tc <ORG> for the grant of a certificate under article or under sub clause of clause of article of the Constitution <ORG> shall order the execution of the sentence to be postponed until such application is disposed of by <ORG> or if a certificate is granted on such application until the period allowed for preferring an appeal to <ORG> on such certificate has expired A second or a third a fourth or further application for mercy docs not take him out of that category unless there is a specific order by the competent authority staying the execution of the death sentence The American Judge observed in <NAME> case Very recently <ORG> reiterated the firmly established due process principles that where governmental action may seriously injure an individual and the reasonableness of that action depends on fact findings the evidence used to prove the governments case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue The nature of the alleged right involved the nature of the proceeding and the possible burden on that proceeding are all considerations which must be taken into account A meaningful passage in the appellate judgment in the same case may be excerpted We are not to be understood as disapproving the judgement of many courts that our constitutional scheme does not contemplate that society may commit law breakers to the capricious and arbitrary actions of prison officials <ORG> of the United states in <NAME> McDonnell considered the question of due process and prison disciplinary hearing confrontation and cross examination and even presence of counsel We hold that written notice of the charges must be given to the dsciplinary action defendant in order to inform him of the charges and to enable him to marshal the facts and prepare a defence We need not pursue the matter further here how ever for there is no claim that respondent <NAME> is within the class of inmates entitled to advice or help from others in the course of a prison disciplinary hearing There is nothing more corrosive to the fabric of a public institution such as a prison than a feeling among those whom it contains that they are being treated unfairly But in my view there is no constitutional impediment to a disciplinary board composed of responsible prison officials like those on <ORG> here One of these is that where govern mental action seriously injures an individual and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact findings the evidence used to prove the Government case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue While this is important in the case of documentary evidence it is even more important where the evidence consists of the testimony of individuals whose memory might be faulty or who in fact might be perjurers or persons motivated by malice vindictiveness intolerance prejudice or jealously That mistrust does not depend on an assumption of inveterate venality or incompetence on the part of men in Power Going the whole length of extending the right to cross examination the learned Judge took the view that fair procedure inside prisons is part of a successful rehabilitative programme and observed The goal is to reintegrate inmates into a society where men are supposed to be treated fairly by the government not arbitrarily emphasis added Quite a few other decisions of this lesser level courts of the United States have been brought to our notice by counsel in an endeavour to validate or invalidate solitary confinement from a constitutional angle Unless driven to pronounce upon constitutionality we may not go into the question at all Even so for a perspicacious understanding of the facets of solitary confinement its soul or rather its soullessness I may refer to a few of the cited cases Functionally speaking the court has a distinctive duty to reform prison practices and to inject constitutional consciousness into the system There is no dispute that all but the petitioner were of the class category that is men whose socio economic lot was weak We merely mention this fact but decline to be deflected by it because it is disputed although the jail officers cannot be faulted if they are influenced by such information The petitioner informed of the order Discomfited <NAME> has moved this Court We have it on the petitioner word that no holiday was given to the bar fetter therapy although the Resident Medical Officer has noted in the history ticket of the prisoner entries which are tell tale In an endeavour to make out that there was discrimination and recklessness in the imposition of bar fetters the petitioner has set out two circumstances Besides there are provisions which specify situations where ordinarily prisoners are exempt from fetters and fetters shall not ordinarily and without special reasons to be recorded by the Superintendent in his Journal be imposed on any unconvicted criminal prisoner See To avoid conclusion it is not apt to state that these rules and instructions have no legal force as the source of power desiderates for their validity the sanction of the Local Government Mere violence by a prisoner of bad behaviour or other misconduct which has no reference to safe custody has no relevance to The character of the prisoner not generally but with specific reference to safe custody must be studied by the Superintendent and if he reaches the conclusion responsibly that there is necessity to confine the man in irons to prevent escape from custody he may exercise his powers under Such a power except in cases of extreme urgency difficult to imagine in a grim prison setting where armed guards are obviously available at instant notice and watch towers vigilantly observe save in case of sudden riot or mutiny extraordinarly can be exercised only after giving notice and hearing and in an unbiased manner At night when the prisoner is in a cell there is no particular reason to apprehend or possibility of escape If there is delay the negation of good faith in the sense of absence of due care is inevitable and the validity of the order is in peril The visitors official and non official have power to call for and inspect jail records The learned Additional Solicitor General urged that there was a built in guideline for the superintendent discretion We cannot lose sight of the fact that a non convict prisoner is to be regarded differently and it may even be a misnomer to treat such a remandee as a prisoner He cited authorities to which we will presently come but before examining them as validation of incapacitation of risky prisoners we may as well refer to some aspects of the problem presented by what kind of danger should lead to incapacitation what authority is to make the decision on whether or not that danger is present on what basis is that authority to decide who among offenders is dangerous and for how long Predictions of dangerousness are hazardous Writes <NAME> Considerable attention has been given to the role of psychological tests in predicting dangerous behaviour and there is a wide range of opinion as to their value More dangerous are these expedients when imposed by the untuned and untrained power of a jail superior who has as part of his professional equipment no course in human psychology stressology or physiology who has to depend on no medical or psychiatric examination prior to infliction of irons or solitary who has no obligation to hear the victim before harming him whose reasons are in English on the histcry tickets and therefore unknowable and in the Journal to which the prisoner has no access It is worthwhile recalling the observations of <NAME> made in a different context but has a philosophic import Natural justice requires that before a law can become operative it must be promulgated or published All over the world torturers seem to feel a desire to appear respectable to their victims There is an endlessly inventive list of new methods of inflicting pain and suffering on fellow human beings that quickly cross continents and ideological barriers through some kind of international secret police network They flow from the elevating observations of <NAME> as he then was in Bhuvan Mohan amplified by humanity We cannot do better than say that the directive principle contained in Article of the Constitution that The State shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work may benevolently be extended to living conditions in jails There are subtle forms of punishment to which convicts and undertrial prisoners are sometimes subjected but it must be realised that these barbarous relics of a bygone era offend against the letter and spirit of our Constitution A previous hearing minimal may be shall be afforded to the victims This applies to cases as much of prison punishment as of safety fetters Where power to punish is granted to persons in lower levels of administrative authority there is an inherent and natural difficulty in enforcing the limitations of that power Positive experiments in re humanization meditation music arts of self expression games useful work with wages prison festivals <ORG> and service oriented activities visits by and to families even par ticipative prison projects and controlled community life are among the re humanization strategies which need consideration I hopefully alert the nation and for the nonce leave follow up action to the <ORG> with the note that stone walls and iron bars do not ensure a people progress and revolutionary history teaches that tense bastilles are brittle before human upsurges and many tenants of iron cells are sensitive harbingers of Tomorrow many a Socrates <NAME> tilak <NAME> <NAME> So it is that there is urgency for bridging the human gap between prison praxis and prison justice in one sense it is a battle of the tenses and in an another an imperative of social justice to be supported by the provisions of of the Prisons Act for short the Act <NAME> a French national and then an under trial prisoner challenges the action of the Superintendent of Jail putting him into bar fetters for an unusually long period commencing from the date of incarceration on th July till this Court intervented by an interim order on th February There are certain broad submissions common to both the petitions and they may first be dealt before turning to specific contentions in each petition However a prisioner liberty is in the very nature of things circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement His interest in the limited liberty left to him is then all the more substantial A compulsion under the authority of law following upon a conviction to live in a prison house entails by its own force the deprivation of fundamental freedoms like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practice a profession A man of profession would thus stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence tees other freedoms like the right to acquire hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment Likewise even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law Mr <NAME> who gave us competent assistance as an amicus curiae for <ORG> after drawing our attention to the development of psycho pathological syndrome in prisoners under solitary confinement for an unlimited period urged that of the Act does not empower the prison authorities to place the prisoner in solitary confinement It is abolished in but it is still retained in <ORG> sub of enables the prison authority to impose solitary confinement of a prisoner under sentence of death not as a consequence of violation of prison discipline but on the sole and solitary ground that the prisoner is a prisoner under sentence of death the provision contained in sub would offend article in the first place as also articles and It must atonce be made clear that sub of does not empower the prison authority to impose solitary confinement in the sense in which that word is understood in para of Jail Manual upon a prisoner under sentence of death The <ORG> cannot award more than three months solitary confinement even if the total term of imprisonment exceeds one year see IPC Section confers power on the Superintendent to question any person alleged to have committed a jail offence and punish him for such offence The Superintendent may examine any person touching any such offence and determine thereupon and punish such offence by separate confinement for any period not exceeding three months Explanation Separate confinement means such confinement with or without labour as secludes a prisoner from communication with but not from sight of other prisoners and allows him not less than one hour exercise per diem and to have his meals in association with one or more other prisoners cellular confinement for any period not exceeding fourteen days Provided that such restriction of diet shall in no case be applied interval of not less duration than such period must elapse before the prisoner is again sentenced to cellular or solitary confinement Explanation Cellular confinement means such confinement with or without labour as entirely secludes a prisoner from communication with but not from sight of other prisoners If does not empower the jail authority to keep a condemned prisoner in solitary confinement the expression such prisoner shall be confined in a cell apart from all other prisoners will have to be given some rational meaning to effectuate the purpose behind the provision so as not to attract the vice of solitary confinement We will presently point out the nature of detention in prison since the time capital sentence is awarded to an accused and until it is executed simultaneously delineating the steps while enforcing the impugned provision In other words it must be a sentence which the authority charged with the duty to execute and carry out must proceed to carry out without intervention from any outside authority But as the prisoner is not to be kept in solitary confinement and the custody in which he is to be kept under as interpreted by us would preclude detention in solitary confinement there is no chance of imposing second punishment upon him and therefore is not violative of Article Article guarantees protection of life and personal liberty Though couched in negative language it confers the fundamental right to life and personal liberty The inhibition against its deprivation extends to all these limits and faculties by which life is enjoyed The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body or amputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an eye or the destruction of any other organ of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world by the term liberty as wed in the provision something more is meant than mere freedom from physical restraint or the bonds of a prison Personal liberty as used in Article is has been held to be a compendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make personal liberties of the man other than those dealt with in clause of Article the fundamental right guaranteed by the article no recourse can be had to fundamental right conferred by another article The word law in the expression procedure established by law in article has been interpreted to mean in <NAME> case supra that the law must be right just and fair not arbitrary fanciful or oppressive Incidentally it was also urged that the classification envisaged by of prisoner under sentence of death is irrational and it is not based upon any intelligible differentia which would distinguish persons of one class from others left out and the basis of differentiation I SCR I SCC There is no warrant for an implicit belief that every prisoner under sentence of death is necessarily violent or dangerous which requires his segregation It was therefore said that to proceed on the assumption that every prisoner under sentence of death is necessarily of violent propensities and dangerous to the community of co prisoners is unwarranted and the classification on the basis of sentence does not provide any intelligible differentia It is true that there is no warrant for the inference that a prisoner under sentence of death is necessarily of violent propensities or dangerous to co prisoners It is imposed keeping in view the safety of the prisoner and the prison security and it is not violative of article <NAME> a foreigner was arrested on th July and on th July he was served with an order of detention under of the Maintenance of Security Act In the affidavit in reply on behalf of respondent no the Superintendent of Tihar Central Jail dated th September gory details of the criminal activities of the petitioner are set out simultaneously saying that the petitioner is of extremely desperate and dangerous nature whose presence is needed by <ORG> and therefore it has been considered necessary to keep him under fetters while in Jail While examining the constitutional validity of we have not allowed our vision to be coloured based or abridged by these averments as in our opinion for the main contention raised by the petitioner they may not be relevant The petitioner contends that of the Prisons Act so far as it confers unguided uncanalised and arbitrary powers on the Superintendent to confine a prisoner in irons is ultra vires articles and the challenge under article being not open to him Then there is a horizontal bar which keeps the two legs apart and there are two verticle bars which are hooked to the waist belt which makes It was tartly said that the prisoner have no fundamental freedom to escape from lawful custody and therefore they cannot complain against precautionary measures which impede escape from the prison Article forbids deprivation of personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law and curtailment of personal liberty to such an extent as to be a negation of it would constitute deprivation Bar fetters make a serious inroad on the limited personal liberty which a prisoner is left with and therefore before such erosion can be justified it must have the authority of law Section confers power for issuing instructions by the Inspector General of Prison with the sanction of <ORG> and section confers power on <ORG> to make rules which would include the rule regulating confinement in fetters The question therefore is whether the power conferred on the Superintendent by is unguided and uncanalised in the sense that the Superintendent can pick and choose a prisoner arbitrarily for being subjected to bar fetters for such length of time as he thinks fit and for any purpose he considers desirable punitive or otherwise No we would exclude from consideration the state of prison requirement because there is no material placed on record to show that the petitioner was put in bar fetters in view of the physical state of the Tihar Central Jail In this context we may profitably refer to <ORG> case supra We are therefore of A the opinion that the power under can be exercised only for reasons and considerations which are germane to the objective of the statute viz safe custody of the prisoner which takes in considerations regarding the character and propensities of the prisoner The nature and length of sentence or the magnitude of the crime committed by the prisoner are not relevant for the purpose of determining that question It may be made clear that as far as posrsible these reasons must be recorded in the prisoner history ticket in the language intelligible and understandable by the prisoner so as to make the next safeguard effective viz In order to give full effect to the requirement of para the Superintendent will have himself to review the case of the prisoner at regular and frequent intervals for ascertaining whether the fetters can be removed consistently with the requirement of safety It thus becomes clear that there are sufficient guidelines in which contain a number of safe Both the petitions are accordingly disposed of in the light of the observations made in the judgment Justice <NAME> has delivered an elaborate judgement which deals with the important issues raised before us at great length and with great care and concern
