There is however no difficulty in pointing out that an agriculturist merely because he happens to market his crops will not be a dealer nor will he be a dealer because the agricultural produce has been put to some kind of treatment only in order to make it marketable Whether an agricultural produce has lost its character as such by a process contemplated by explanation will depend upon the particular facts in each case In the absence as I said of the necessary facts it is not possible for this Court to express any opinion The question whether a person is a dealer is more or less a jurisdictional question and in the first instance the assessing authority will have the right to decide it It is contended for the petitioner that the Commercial Tax Officer has already prejudged the two questions The replies of the Commercial Tax Officer will have to be understood in the light of the communications sent by the petitioner to him In the circumstances as and when the petitioner files a return for the year in question the authorities will determine the two questions afresh without bringing to bear upon them any preconceived or prejudiced notions but in the light of the facts found by the department on the materials produced by the petitioner
