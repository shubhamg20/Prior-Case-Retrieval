We agree with the finding of the District Judge on it The question we have to consider is whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim subrogation and to stand in the shoes of the mortgagee under Exhibit We may dismiss at once the argument of Mr <NAME> that there is nothing to show that part of the mortgage money under Exhibit A was applied in discharge of Exhibit It is not open to the appellant to raise this contention for there was no express denial IK the written statement of the allegation in the plaint that part of the mortgage money was so applied There was no express statement of an intention to keep alive the discharged mortgage There was no intermediate incumbrance against which the prior mortgage might be presumed to be kept alive The appeal is otherwise dismissed with costs
