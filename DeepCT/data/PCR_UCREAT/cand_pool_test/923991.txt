The term capital expenditure is used as contrasted with the term revenue expenditure in respect of which the assessee is entitled to allowance under section xv of the Act Though it is not easy to reconcile all the decided cases on the subject as each case had been decided on its peculiar facts some broad principles could be deduced from what the learned judges have laid down from time to time Outlay is deemed to be capital when it is made for the initiation of a business for extension of a business or for a substantial replacement of equipment vide Lord Sands in Commissioners of Inland Revenue <ORG> and <ORG> <NAME> Expenditure may be treated as properly attributable to capital when it is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade vide <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> Under clause a further protection was given by the lessor to the lessee in respect of the whole of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills District for which lessee was to pay annually Rs The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI This appeal from the judgment And order of <ORG> with leave under section A of the Indian Income tax Act raises an interesting question as to the line of demarcation between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure Certain broad tests have however been attempted to be laid down and the earliest was the one indicated in the following observations of <ORG> in the course of the argument in <ORG> <NAME> You do not use it for the purpose of your concern which means for the purpose of carrying on your concern but you use it to acquire the concern expenditure as against what is income expenditure to say that capital expenditure is a thing that is a going to be spent once and for all and income expenditure is a thing that is going to recur every year Viscount <NAME> there observed at page But there remains the question which I have found more difficult whether apart from the express prohibitions the sum in question is in the words used by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> case a proper debit item to be charged against incomings of the trade when computing the profits of it or in other words whether it is in substance a revenue or a capital expenditure This appears to me to be a question of fact which is proper to be decided by the Commissioners upon the evidence brought before them in each case but where as in the present case there is no express finding by the Commissioners upon the point it must be determined by the Courts upon the materials which are available and with due regard to the principles which have been laid down in the authorities but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advan tage for the enduring benefit of a trade I think that there is very good reason in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital It seems rather that the cases of <NAME> and of <NAME> Noble Ltd Inspector of Taxes The above cases serve to establish the difficulty of the question rather than to affirm any principle to be applied in all cases The test of circulating as contrasted with fixed capital is as good a test in most cases to my mind as can be found but that involves the question of fact was the outlay in the particular case from fixed or circulating capital <NAME> at page pointed out the difficulties in applying this test also to the true nature of the expenditure and to ask oneself the question is it a part of the company working expenses is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning In the case before them they came to the conclusion that the obligation to make the payments was undertaken By the appellants in consideration of their acquisition of the right and opportunity to earn profits i of the right to conduct the business and not for the purpose of producing profits in the conduct of the business Nor is it easy to reconcile all the decisions that were cited before us for each case has been decided on its peculiar facts Outlay is deemed to be capital when it is made for the initiation of a business for extension of a business or for a substantial replacement of equipment vide Lord <NAME> in Commissioners of Inland Revenue <ORG> In <ORG> Styles at page <NAME> observed as to the capital expenditure as follows You do not use it for the purpose of your concern which means for the purpose of carrying on your concern but you use it to acquire the concern Expenditure may be treated as properly attributable to capital when it is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade vide Viscount Cave in <NAME> <ORG> and <ORG> In cases where the expenditure is made for the initial outlay or for extension of a business or a substantial replacement of the equipment there is no doubt that it is capital expenditure The question however arises for consideration where expenditure is incurred while the business is going on and is not incurred either for extension of the business or for the substantial replacement of its equipment If on the other hand it is made not for the purpose of bringing into existence any such asset or advantage but for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profits it is a revenue expenditure The aim and object of the expenditure would determine the character of the expenditure whether it is a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure It was observed there If the purchaser of a business undertakes to the vendor as one of the terms of the purchase that he will pay a sum annually to a third party irrespective of whether the business yields any profits or not it would be difficult to say that the annual payments were made solely for the purpose of earning the profits of the business The expression once and for all is used to denote an expenditure which is made once and for all for procuring an enduring benefit to the business as distinguished from a recurring expenditure in the nature of operational expenses It is made with a view to acquiring an asset that may be turned over in the course of trade at a comparatively early date These are the principles which have to be applied in order to determine whether in the present case the expenditure incurred by the company was capital expenditure or revenue expenditure The asset which the company had acquired in consideration of this recurring payment was in the nature of a capital asset the right to carry on its business unfettered by any competition from outsiders within the area
