Thereupon the Income tax Officer issued a notice to the assessee under Section of the Income tax Act reopened the assessment and added a sum of Rs The appeals filed by the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and <ORG> were dismissed Before <ORG> it was contended that the assessee had made a true and full disclosure of all primary facts even at the time of the original assessment and therefore the Income tax Officer was not justified in reopening the assessment under Section a At the instance of the assessee the <ORG> has referred to us the following question for our opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances <ORG> Chandigarh has rightly upheld the reopening of the assessment under Section a of the Income tax Act On the other hand <NAME> learned counsel for the department argued that the obligation on the assessee was to disclose the facts both fully and truly and if the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that material facts had not been truly disclosed he was competent to reopen the assessment If a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the ommission or failure on the part of an assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year he may assess or reassess such income for the assessment year concerned The expression material facts necessary for assessment occurred in Section of the Act which corresponded to Section of the Act On the other hand if the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that primary facts were not fully disclosed or that they were not truly disclosed he may reopen the assessment They said pages There can be no doubt that the duty of disclosing all the primary facts relevant to the decision of the question before the assessing authority lies on the assessee Does the duty however extend beyond the full and truthful disclosure of all primary facts In our opinion the answer to this question must be in the negative It is not for somebody else far less the assessee to tell the assessing authority what inferences whether of facts or law should be drawn We have therefore come to the conclusion that while the duty of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary relevant facts it does not extend beyond this Again they said page It is the duty of the assessee to disclose all the facts which have a bearing on the question The law does not require the assessee to state the conclusion that could reasonably be drawn from the primary facts The question of the assessee intention is an inferential fact and so the assessee omission to state his true intentions behind the sale of shares cannot by itself be considered to be a failure or omission to disclose any material fact within the meaning of Section But in the present case <ORG> at the time of the original assessment specifically required the assessee to prove the cash credits standing in the names of all the firms including the five firms mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment and the petitioner firm satisfied <ORG> about the genuineness of those accounts It is thus apparent that the Income tax Officer has changed his opinion on account of subsequent information which has come into his possession It would be a case where <ORG> has reason to believe on the basis of subsequent information that the assessee had failed to disclose material facts truly It is no responsibility of the assessee to advise the Income tax Officer with regard to the inference which he should draw from the primary facts The grounds or reasons which lead to the formation of the belief con templated by Section a of the Act must have a material bearing on the question of escapement of income of the assessee from assessment because of his failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts Once there exist reasonable grounds for the Income tax officer to form the above belief that would be sufficient to clothe him with jurisdiction to issue notice In regard to the first ground the Income tax Officer did not explain how the circumstance that some of the creditors were known name lenders could lead to a reasonable belief that the assessee had failed to disclose facts fully and truly In regard to the second ground <ORG> noticed that there was nothing to show that the confession related to the loan to the assessees nor was there any indication whether the assessment related to the relevant period In other words there was no indication that the confession related directly or indirectly to the loan to the assessee It was therefore held that there was no rational connection between the confession and the formation of the reasonable belief necessary for reopening an assessment under Section If there were before the Income tax Officer at the time of issuance of notice under Section but not at the time of regular assessment confessional statements indicating that the loans to the assessee were bogus loans it has to be held that the Income tax Officer was justified in reopening the assessment <NAME> invited our attention to the order of <ORG> where it has been stated When the racket of hundis was exploded on all India basis and the hundi racket became a notorious fact the Income tax Officer found that the credits shown in the names of the parties were merely name lending credits based on hawala business and as there were confessional statements of the creditors or the creditors had been proved to be merely lending their names without lending the money were indulging in hawala business he reopened the case under Section a We have seen his reasons to believe and we are satisfied that the Income tax Officer was within his right to reopen the case under Section a because his reasons to believe were covered by Section a
