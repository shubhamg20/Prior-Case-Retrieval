The application to set aside the sale was allowed in the first instance by an order of the <ORG> dated th March The sale proceeds were in excess of the amount due under the decree and therefore the portion of the surplus sale proceeds remained in deposit for payment to the judgment debtors the decree holder having already taken the sum which was found due to him A direction was given to the decree holder to refund the amount withdrawn by him The decree holder however preferred an appeal to the District Judge against the order setting aside the sale An appeal was however taken to <ORG> against the order confirming the sale by one of the judgment debtors and not by the present appellant <NAME> The District Judge was of opinion that the right of the judgment debtor for restitution really accrued on th August when the order setting aside the order setting aside the sale or in other words the order confirming the sale was made by the District Judge on th August under Article of the Schedule to the Limitation Act As this application for restitution was not made within three years from the time when the right to apply accrued the application was barred by the said article He accordingly dismissed the application of the judgment debtor for restitution on the ground of limitation Against this decision the present appeal has been preferred and it has been contended on behalf of the appellant that the application could not be treated as one under Section Civil namely as an application for restitution It was really an application for asking the <ORG> to exercise its inherent powers under the provisions of Section Civil and in support of this contention reliance has been placed on the recent decision of this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> in which my learned brother <NAME> held that in the circumstances similar to the present the <ORG> could act under its inherent powers under Section Civil The learned Judges did not decide in that case that even if the application be treated as one under Section Civil the article of limitation applicable is not Article Of course there is a decision of the Patna High <ORG> which has been referred to by the learned advocate for the respondent in the case of <NAME> <NAME> AIR Pat where it was held that an application in such cases comes both under the provisions of Sections and Civil The real question therefore in controversy is as to when the right did accrue in the appellant for asking for the refund of the money withdrawn by the auction purchaser seeing that the sale has now been confirmed and the money being in excess of the decretal amount really belongs to the judgment debtor It has been held in a series of cases that the right to apply accrues really on the date when for the first time a decision is given which entitled the parties asking for restitution to have restitution and that was undoubtedly in this case on th August That however does not appear to be so for the present appellant was merely a respondent in the said appeal and there was in our opinion nothing to prevent appellant from asking for restitution It is said on behalf of the appellant that he could not have possibly taken that course as that would have affected any right which he might have acquired if the appeal against the order confirming the sale had been allowed We do not see much force in that contention In such circumstances as this the right to ask for refund of the money withdrawn by the auction purchaser arose on th August and he ought to have applied within three years from that date Mr <NAME> has drawn our attention to a passage in that judgment which runs as follows It is at least an intelligible rule that so long as there is any question sub judice between any of the parties those affected shall not be compelled to pursue the so often thorny path of execution which if the final result is against them may lead to no advantage Act meant any appeal of any kind and their Lordships were of opinion that there was no warrant for reading into the words any qualification that the appeal must be regular or competent and that the parties to such subsequent execution proceedings must be parties thereto or that the whole decree must be imperilled On the other hand there are observations of <ORG> in that very case which would go to show that in construing the provisions of the Limitation Act equitable considerations are out of place and the strict grammatical meaning of the words is the only safe guide In this view we are of opinion that the right to apply accrued as soon as the order of the District Judge was made in August confirming the sale and as the present application was not made within three years from that date it has been rightly held that the application was barred by limitation It might be a misfortune to the appellant but we have to administer the law as we find it
