It is alleged for the respondents in the present appeal namely the plaintiff and the defendant <NAME> that after certain negotiations a compromise of this suit and the other suits to which I have referred was effected that the defendant <NAME> expressly authorized his counsel to consent to this compromise on his behalf that the terms of the compromise came before Mr Justice <NAME> and that he made a decree in terms of the compromise so alleged to have been entered into <NAME> the present appellant however contends that though admittedly there were negotiations for a compromise he never authorized his Counsel to agree to the compromise alleged that his Counsel had no such authority and that the compromise was not effective as against him Holding that view he on the th of July gave the notice of motion which will be found set out at page of the paper book which in effect was one asking the <ORG> to stay the drawing up of the so called compromise decree and to have the alleged compromise set aside He further challenges the decree made on the ground that the learned Judge in the <ORG> below ought not to have accepted the unsworn statement of Mr <NAME> when objection was taken by the appellant Counsel that Mr <NAME> ought to have been sworn that the decree was made in the absence of <NAME> who was a party and a necessary party to the suit and that the decree determines certain trusts and provisions relating to a portion of the property in dispute which under the award and decree of th August was declared to be <ORG> and that it was not competent to the <ORG> with the consent only of some of the parties interested to set aside the decree of the th August which was a decree of a competent <ORG> and in the absence of those members of the family who were or who might be interested in maintaining the <ORG> character of such property It must be obvious from what I have said that if we are of opinion upon the evidence for it is a question of fact that the present appellant did not authorize his Counsel Mr <NAME> to consent to this compromise the compromise decree cannot stand and equally obvious that the other questions except that as to the admissibility of Mr <NAME> statement would become of no practical importance and the stress of the argument adduced on behalf of the respondent Counsel has been to show that such authority was in fact given by <NAME> to Mr <NAME> There cannot I think be any reasonable doubt at the present day that Counsel possesses a general authority an apparent authority which must be taken to continue until notice be given to the other side by the client that it has been determined to settle and compromise the suit in which he is actually retained as Counsel and in the exercise of his discretion to do that which he considers best for the interest of his client in the conduct of the particular case in which he is so retained Here however the compromise extended to collateral matters to matters quite outside the scope of the particular case in which Mr <NAME> was retained as Counsel and in order to bind the client it must be shown that Mr <NAME> had from his client a special authority to compromise and compromise upon the definite terms which are set up by the present respondents As to the authority of Counsel to compromise on behalf of his client I may refer to the cases of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> De There are other authorities but I need not refer to them as the proposition of law is not questioned it was thought prudent as there was some doubt upon the point to have the learned Counsel sworn as they were and they gave their evidence from their places at the bar but there is nothing in that case to indicate that any objection was raised I entertain great doubt whether if there be any such objection the other side can insist upon the statement being accepted unless upon oath and in making this observation I am not unmindful of what Lord <NAME> is stated to have said for we have not Lord <NAME> own words that he would never admit an affidavit in such cases In this view it becomes unnecessary to discuss whether as the Advocate General urged the statement was admissible not only under the Indian Evidence Act but as a statement made by a quasi officer of the <ORG> to whose word some sort of special sanctity must be taken to attach a proposition which before its acceptance would require much consideration or to deal with the argument of Sir <NAME> that having regard to Section of the Oaths Act it made no difference whether the statement was or was not upon oath a proposition which is at once novel and startling and which if well founded must apply to the case of every witness and possibly to every Juryman I will now proceed to deal with the facts of the case and I think I am doing no injustice to the judgment of the learned Judge in the Court below when I say that it appears to be almost entirely based upon the statement of Mr <NAME> which the learned Judge regards as clear cogent and convincing I will now deal with Mr <NAME> statement with the view of ascertaining and determining whether if there were nothing but that statement in the way of evidence in the case the respondents have satisfactorily made out that the appellant <NAME> did give an express or special authority to his Counsel to consent to the terms of the compromise It is clear from Mr <NAME> own statement that at the consultation which took place between <NAME> and his Counsel on Monday <NAME> offer was to pay Rs There were several other points discussed at that interview but to cite Mr <NAME> own words our offer was that each party was to pay their costs It will be seen from this that from the very outset the appellant objected to paying the plaintiff costs of the suit which admittedly amounted to a very large sum On the occasion of this interview on Tuesday Mr <NAME> went through with the present appellant all the terms suggested by Mr <NAME> and wrote down his objections and I will take it for the moment that the paper Exhibit did indicate all the objections which <NAME> had to Mr <NAME> terms Mr <NAME> says so and he also says that the only two points as to which there was any difference were the party and party costs of the suit and the costs of suit No I confess feeling some difficulty as to how Mr <NAME> could have arrived at this conclusion in the face of his own memorandum in writing which indicates that there were other points in dispute still open There then for the moment was an end of the matter in the sense that the negotiating parties were not at one and that there was then no concluded agreement of compromise The only express or special authority which Mr <NAME> then had to compromise on behalf of his client <NAME> was thus at an end as Mr <NAME> would not accept the terms proposed by <NAME> through his Counsel Mr <NAME> I am taking it that looking at Exhibit the words as to all parties paying their own costs applied only to suit No of On Wednesday the th it was stated to the <ORG> that the parties had been unable to come to terms and the case was again adjourned in the hope of an amicable settlement Mr <NAME> stated that there was only one very small item which had not been settled but if the evidence filed on behalf of the appellant to be trustworthy Mr <NAME> must have known on the Tuesday afternoon that even if in his interview with Mr <NAME> on the Tuesday <NAME> had agreed to pay the plaintiff costs of this suit he had resiled from that position later on in the same day By the Thursday morning then there was no agreement of settlement and it is important to see what took place on that day in the way of express authority being given to Mr <NAME> to compromise on his client behalf I will quote what he says I was also informed by <NAME> that <NAME> and <NAME> had gone to see <NAME> on the subject and before the mid day adjournment I was informed that <NAME> had consented either to buy a house worth Rs I feel some difficulty in understanding how Mr <NAME> could have thought and told the <ORG> that the only obstacle in the way of a settlement had been removed when on the previous evening he had been expressly told that <NAME> was unwilling to pay the plaintiff costs or what authority he had to agree to the terms of the previous Tuesday as in the interval <NAME> had told him that he would not pay the party and party costs of the plaintiff and when those modifications were rejected by Mr <NAME> it seems to me that Mr <NAME> special authority was determined and that in order to bind <NAME> as to any fresh terms a further special authority would be requisite It is clear that be was determined not to pay those costs for he had told <NAME> only an hour or so before that he would not pay the plaintiff costs The suggestion of the solicitor is to my mind very significant by indicating that he at any rate was under the impression that there was at least great doubt whether <NAME> was agreeing to the terms He only smiled and Mr <NAME> told him I am going back to <ORG> and these terms will be put in and he also told him that he was going to consent on his behalf to which <NAME> said nothing and so the interview came to an end If this were all the evidence in the case I should entertain a very grave doubt whether having regard to the fact that <NAME> had at the very outset of the interview of th said that he would not pay the party and party costs of the plaintiff in this suit but only a specified sum and would not pay the costs of Suit No we should be justified in holding that under the circumstances narrated by Mr <NAME> the latter was justified in consenting to the minutes or that we should be justified in saying that <NAME> gave him express authority to consent to these terms I have hitherto dealt with the case entirely upon the statement of Mr <NAME> but there is a great deal of evidence in the matter to which the learned Judge in the <ORG> below has given no attention We have the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant and if the story of these witnesses is to be believed and none of them have been cross examined <NAME> never did agree to the terms of this compromise or authorized his Counsel to agree to them I may perhaps here interpose the observation that Mr <NAME> at the moment that he left the <ORG> to see <NAME> on the Thursday could scarcely have thought that he had any sufficient authority from him to consent to the proposed compromise for if so he would not have thought it necessary to go outside the precincts of the <ORG> to the office of the attorney who was instructing him to interview his lay client It would appear from the evidence of <NAME> that at the interview which took place between Mr <NAME> and <NAME> on Tuesday when Mr <NAME> written terms were discussed an assurance was given to <NAME> that the plaintiff costs of the present suit would not exceed Rs It is contended however that as the respondents were not told that Mr <NAME> had no authority to settle the appellant is bound Counsel no doubt has an apparent authority to compromise the case in which he is retained and the other side are entitled to rely upon the continuance of that apparent authority until they receive notice that it has been determined But that principle does not apply to the present case where an express or special authority was requisite
