He asked <NAME> the then Circle Inspector of <ORG> who was also present at Village Basaha on the th November to enquire into the matter There was also a mention of the fact that the appellant had accepted a sum of Rs They stated that they had respectively paid Rs It further appears that the appellant was also present there at village Thumba and he undertook in presence of the Circle Officer to refund all the amounts taken by him the total of which was Rs He however did not take cognizance of the case immediately on receipt of the complaint as it appears that probably the sanction of the Collector which was stated to have been filed along with the complaint petition was not received by him This was filed in the court of the Special Judge on the th August whereupon he took cognizance of the case under Section of Criminal Law Amendment Act hereinafter called Act XLVI of The defence of the appellant has been that he has committed no offence and a false case has been filed against him at the instance of the Circle Inspector is invalid inasmuch as there is no material in the case to indicate that the facts constituting the offence with which the appellant has been charged with were placed before the sanction authority namely the Collector That the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the charge is not reliable and the guilt has not been brought home to the appellant In my opinion there is no substance in the first point urged on behalf of the appellant Section A of Act II of broadly speaking merely modifies the provisions of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure and provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the said Code no police officer below the rank of the officers specified in Clauses a to of Section A shall investigate any offence punishable under Section Section or Section A of the Sub section of Section of Act XLVI of states A special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates Section does not provide as to in what manner and on what material the Special Judge may take cognizance of the offences referred to therein For this one has to go to the provisions of Sub section of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure I find no sufficient reason to import the provisions of Clause of Sub section of Section and to hold that the Special Judge may take cognizance of the offence only upon a report in writing of the facts of the offence made by any police officer and not otherwise It therefore follows that he can take cognizance upon receiving a complaint of the facts which constitute the offence or even upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge of suspicion that the offence has been committed In this connection I may refer to the evidence of the persons who had filed the petition Ext If the case of the appellant and the evidence of a large number of prosecution witnesses who claimed to have made payments to the appellant is judged in the background of his paying back the money to the persons concerned I have no doubt in my mind that their evidence in reliable and truthful although the criticisms levelled against their evidence in regard to the payments of money to the appellant may not be without substance None the less I am not impressed by the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that if the enquiry would have been by a police officer of the rank mentioned in Section A of Act II of perhaps there would have been no prosecution in this case and since the departmental enquiry was perfunctory the appellant was prejudiced in his defence Assuming that the departmental enquiry was perfunctory the evidence adduced in Court seems to me truthful and reliable and that being so in my opinion the fact has been proved that the appellant had accepted money from as many as eighteen persons in June and or July and therefore he had committed the offence of criminal misconduct in the discharge of his duty within the meaning of Clause a of Sub section of Section of Act II of punishable under Sub section of that section Nobody on behalf of the prosecution has deposed to the fact that the gist of evidence contained in Exhibits series was placed before the Collector at the time when he made the order of sanction for the prosecution of the appellant But if the facts constituting the offence charged are not shown on the face of the sanction the prosecution must prove the extraneous evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authority It has further been pointed out The sanction to prosecute is an important matter it constitutes a condition precedent to the institution of the prosecution and the Government have an absolute discretion to grant or withhold their sanction Reliance was placed on behalf of the <ORG> on an unreported decision of this Court to which I was a party in <NAME> <ORG> Criminal Appeal No With reference to the facts of both those cases it would be noticed that the documents on the basis of which sanction orders had been obtained in those cases were produced and got exhibited by the prosecution in urt and those documents did contain the facts of the case The test therefore laid down by <ORG> and <ORG> in the two cases referred to above was satisfied in both those cases but in my opinion it is not satisfied in the case in hand In the result I allow the appeal and set aside the conviction of and the sentence imposed upon the appellant
