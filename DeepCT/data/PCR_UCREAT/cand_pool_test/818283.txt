Vs RESPONDENT THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX DELHI AJMER RAJASTHAN AND DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> DAS SHAH CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO RF SC SC SC SC SC RF SC SC ACT Income tax Reference Power of High Court to call for supplemental statement of case Indian Income tax Act HEADNOTE The appellant entered into contract with <ORG> for the supply of goods and in the assessment year Rs Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the profits and gains in respect of the sales made to the <ORG> of India were received by the assessee in the taxable terri tories <ORG> remanded the case to the <ORG> for a supplemental statement of case calling for a finding on the question whether the cheques were sent to the assessee firm by post or by hand and what directions if any had the assessee firm given to the department in the matter Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March of <ORG> in Civil Reference No of The special leave granted by this Court is limited to the question whether <ORG> had jurisdiction in this case to call for the supplemental statement The assessee then applied for a reference to <ORG> under of the Indian Income tax Act and by its order dated December <ORG> referred the following question for the decision of <ORG> Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the profits and gains in respect of the sales made to <ORG> were received by the assessee in the taxable territories The <ORG> had stated in the statement of the case as follows The payment was made by <ORG> by cheques drawn on <ORG> Bombay Branch it would be necessary for <ORG> to find inter alia whether the cheques were sent to the assessee firm by post or by hand and what directions if any had the assessee firm given to the <ORG> in the matter In <ORG> case <ORG> asked for a supplementary statement of the case from the Tribunal as to whether there was any express request by the assessee that the cheque should be sent by post and held that as there was no such express request the receipt of the money was not where the cheque was posted but at the place where the money was received Later the principle was extended still further by this Court in <ORG> case This was expressly found to be so by this <ORG> in these words The only ground urged by the <ORG> at all material stages was that because the amounts which were received from the merchants or the Government were received by cheques drawn on banks in British India which were ultimately encashed in British India the monies could not be said to have been received in Bhavnagar though the cheques were in fact received at Bhavnagar The question referred was thus limited to the legal effect of the receipt of the cheques at Bhavnagar without advertence to the fact whether the cheques were so sent by post at the request express or implied of the <ORG> In repelling the objection that such an enquiry was alien to the point decided by the <ORG> and might require fresh evidence <ORG> justified itself by saying But we cannot shut out the necessary inquiry which even from our own point of view is necessary to be made in order that we should satisfactorily answer the question raised in the Reference It must not be forgotten that under section of the Income tax Act we have a right independently of the conduct of the parties to direct the <ORG> to state further facts so that we may properly exercise our own advisory jurisdiction The case thus set two limits to the jurisdiction of <ORG> under and they were that the advisory jurisdiction was confined a to the facts on the record and or found by the <ORG> and the question which would arise from the <ORG> order Whereas the <ORG> had only referred the question Whether the receipt of the cheques at Bhavnagar amounted to receipt of sale proceeds in Bhavnagar what <ORG> intended deciding was Whether the posting of the cheques in British India at the request express or implied of the appellant amounted to receipt of sale proceeds in British India These were two totally different questions and it was held that <ORG> could not decide a matter which was different from that decided by the <ORG> nor call for a statement of the case bearing on this new matter The proposition laid down in the <ORG> case finds support from yet another case of this Court decided very recently It decided the question of assessability on the short ground that the income had not arisen in Baroda but in British India Section of the Income tax Act which confers jurisdiction upon <ORG> only permits a reference of a question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> It does not confer jurisdiction on <ORG> to decide a different question of law not arising out of such order It is possible that the same question of law may involve different approaches for its solution and <ORG> may amplify the question to take in all the approaches It follows from this that the enquiry in such cases must be to see whether the question decided by the <ORG> admits the consideration of the new point as an integral or even an incidental part thereof The fact that in <ORG> case <ORG> had asked for a supplemental statement in the same way as in the <ORG> case and this Court did not rule out the new matter cannot help the assessee in the present case because the jurisdiction of <ORG> was not questioned as it had been done in the <ORG> case or has been done here The next question is whether <ORG> has transgressed the second limitation implicit is that is to say that the question must arise out of the facts admitted and or found by the <ORG> <ORG> has observed that it would be necessary for the Appellate <ORG> to find inter alia whether the cheques were sent to the assessee firm by post or by hand and what directions if any bad the assessee firm given to the <ORG> in that matter
