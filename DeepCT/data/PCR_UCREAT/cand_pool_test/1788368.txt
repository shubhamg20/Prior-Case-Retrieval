In this case an application was made to Mr Justice <NAME> purporting to be in the Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Court for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of one <NAME> whom I will call the applicant The general circumstances giving rise to the application are these On the th June he was served with an order made by <ORG> under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act by which he wa directed to proceed to Midnapore to report himself to the Superintendent of Police there to proceed afterwards direct to the police station of a certain village in that District and to reside until further orders in that village He had to deliver unopened to the officer in charge of the police station all communications sent to him by letter telegram or otherwise The applicant at the day of his application to this Court was the subject of another order made by <ORG> under the same Act and dated the th November It was made by the Governor of Bengal under the provisions of Section of the Government of India Act Section prescribes t<NAME>t where in the opinion of <ORG> there are reasonable grounds for believing t<NAME>t any person <NAME>s committed or is about to commit certain acts in the nature of offences <ORG> if it is satisfied t<NAME>t he is a member or is being controlled or instigated by the member of any association of which the object or methods include the doing of any such acts or the commission of any of such offences may by order in writing give certain directions It says t<NAME>t a person who comes within its scope s<NAME>ll be punis<NAME>ble with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and s<NAME>ll also be liable to fine The position of this applicant at the time of this application was t<NAME>t an order directing him to do or abstain from doing certain specified things <NAME>s been made and he was obeying t<NAME>t order He would <NAME>ve to take his c<NAME>nce of t<NAME>t Court finding t<NAME>t under Section <NAME> hid committed an offence which rendered him liable to imprisonment for a term which might extend to thra years If it be true t<NAME>t a parson ordinarily resident within the Original Jurisdiction of this Court although he be an Indian is clothed with certain rights given originally years ago by Parliamentary enactment to Englishmen in England and if it be true t<NAME>t when he goes into the <NAME> he carries those rights about with him as a kind of personal law differentiating him from ordinary Indian subjects of His Majesty who belong to the Parganas t<NAME>n the circumstance t<NAME>t he is ordinarily resident in Calcutta may be a matter of considerable importance An application having been made to the learned Judge for a writ of habeas corpus the learned Judge in the first place directed notice to go to the respondent and without issuing a rule nisi heard the application in the presence of both parties the Advocate General appearing on behalf of the respondent Logically therefore there are three questions before us first whether there is a right of appeal secondly whether the respondent is a person to whom a writ of habeas corpus could be directed thirdly whether or not the contention that the Act of is illegal is correct In order to decide the question of the existence of the right of appeal it is necessary to determine such questions as for example whether it is open to the applicant to get relief in the nature of a habeas corpus otherwise than under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code It appeared to us that as there are more persons than the applicant in the situation created by the Act of it was hardly consistent with the proper conduct of the public business that this question raised by him should be avoided by reason of pleas in bar directed to the particular relief claimed It seemed to us that it would be more reasonable to examine the matter as a whole because whether this applicant has a right of appeal or not whether or not habeas corpus is the correct form of remedy in this case it must be the duty of this Court sooner or later to determine the very important question whether a certain number of people are being illegally detained under a void Act of the local legislature I propose partly as a matter of convenience and partly for other reasons to deal first with the careful and elaborate argument of Mr <NAME> on the question whether or not the Act of is ultra vires of the authority which purported to make it By the first clause it is enacted that The local legislature of any province has power subject to th provisions of this Act to make laws for the peace and good government of the territories for the time being constituting that province Section gives the Governor General power to make ordinances in case of emergency So that the phrase peace and good government applies not only to the local legislature but to the Governor General power of making ordinances and the power of making regulations in parts of India where there is <ORG> It is sufficient that they are words which are intended to give subject to the restrictions of the Act a legislating power to the body which it invests with that authority There is nothing in that expression which can be the foundation of any reasonable argument to the effect that the Act of was outside the jurisdiction of the local legislature Again there is in the history of the present question nothing which need detain us That clause runs The local legislature of any province has not power to make any law affecting any Act Parliament It is clear enough from the second clause of the same Section A that subject to certain sanction for special cases the local legislature has power to repeal or alter as to that province any law made by any authority in British India whether made before or after Clause of Section which deals with the Indian legislature says that it shall not have power unless expressly so authorised by an Act of <ORG> to make any law repealing or affecting any Act of <ORG> passed after the year and extending to British India or certain other Acts which need not particularly mention Section in its first clause contains these provisions A law made by any authority in British India and repugnant to any provision of this or any other Act of <ORG> shall to the extent of that repugnancy but not otherwise be void The question therefore is whether the power conferred by Section of the local Act of to give the directions given by <ORG> to the applicant or Section of the said Act which purports to make any disobedience thereof a punishable offence are repugnant to Clause of Section A which says that the local legislature shall not make a law affecting any Act of <ORG> Attention has been drawn by Mr <NAME> to the fact that the Act of was passed under Section that is to say not by the vote of <ORG> but by certification Now the argument by which it is sought to show that the enactment is ultra vires of the powers conferred by the local legislature is as follows It is said and quite correctly that it has long been accepted law in this Province that the English common and statute law as it existed in the year was applied in Calcutta not merely to Europeans in Calcutta but to all persons within the limits of the Original Jurisdiction of this Court English statute and English common law as it stood in was applied to Englishmen in this town and with certain special modifications in certain respects which do not now matter to the Indian inhabitants as well Moo in which Lord <NAME> delivered the judgment of <ORG> in The third is the case of the Advocate General of Bengal <NAME> I A where Lord <NAME> gave the judgment of <ORG> upholding the decision of Sir <NAME> and other Judges and deciding that the doctrine of forfeiture to the <ORG> of the properties of persons who are felons of themselves was not part of the law of England which had been introduced into or received in Calcutta In <NAME> commentaries and other books there was much learning as to what happened when Englishmen went out and settled in uninhabited countries and as to what happened in the case of conquered or ceded territories If there is one more elaborate way of going wrong open to this <ORG> than another it is to argue from the analogy of the Colonial Laws Validity Act and from considerations of that kind The plantation of places in Australia may be cases where from the moment of the settlement the English settlers from that first carried with them their own law because the sovereignty of the Crown of England went with them Now the argument of Mr <NAME> is that the th clause of Section A which says that the local legislature has no power to make a law affecting any Act of <ORG> prevents it from making any law which would affect the operation of any of the statutes prior to which were introduced into the area of Calcutta at the time when the Mayor Court Charter was first granted But it cannot be construed as meaning that because in when there was no Other law the Courts in Calcutta adopted the law that prevailed at home subject to many modifications therefore any part of that law so introduced which originated in statute as distinct from common law cannot be interfered with by the local legislature In my judgment that would be giving an extraordinary meaning to a very simple phrase appearing in an enactment which is concerned to delimit the jurisdictions of local legislatures under <ORG> It is quite true that with reference to the criminal law the <ORG> endeavoured to put into practice English statutes and principles and English procedure including of course the procedure and principles which safeguard the personal liberty of the subject So late as it was stated in the case of <NAME> of Lahore <NAME> that that English law as to personal liberty does prevail in Calcutta as to all its inhabitants The common law of England which gives the right to this writ has been introduced in Calcutta with the general body of the English law Section legislative powers were given to the Governor General in <ORG> The answer would have been that there is no warrant for any such process in the Code of Criminal Procedure and many safe guards in the Code of Criminal Procedure to protect against it It does not matter whether one is an inhabitant of Calcutta or a comparatively unhappy inhabitant of Alipore one rights in this matter have been reclaimed from the old law introduced from England and they are part of the great statutory common law of India which has now no special application to the city of Calcutta One of the learned Judges said that If the question arose for consideration we should have to examine the principles recognised in the cases of <NAME> <NAME> of Lahore <NAME> and <NAME> Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court of Bengal Cal Sections and of the Government of India Act would seem to have removed the doubt in the case of statute passed by the Indian legislature after It does not seem to me to be possible to conduct public business in an atmosphere of doubt maintained after this manner upon such a point and as we have to pronounce upon the question whether there is in this case a right of appeal I think we are called upon to decide the question The Indian High <ORG>s Act of and Vic chapter by its th clause gave power to Her Majesty to set up High <ORG>s which should have such jurisdiction power and authority as Her Majesty may by such Letters Patent grant and direct subject however to such directions and limitations as to the exercise of Original Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction beyond the limits of the Presidency Towns as may be prescribed thereby and save as by such Letters Patent may be otherwise directed and subject to and without prejudice to the legislative powers in relation to the matters aforesaid of the Governor General of India in Council <ORG> to be established in each Presidency shall have and exercise all jurisdiction and every power and authority whatsoever in any manner vested in any of the <ORG> in the same Presidency abolished under this Act at time of the abolition of such last mentioned <ORG>s The matter which has given rise to difficulty is apparently this that in the East India <ORG>s Act of the same year there was a provision in Section that the Governor General in <ORG> shall not have the power of making any laws or Regulations which shall repeal or in any way affect any provisions of any Act passed in this present Session of <ORG> etc This provision gave rise to discussion in two cases Queen <NAME> and Emperess <NAME> Cal I see no reason whatever for holding that the old writs or forms of procedure were put beyond the reach of the Indian legislature In the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of was enacted which gave the right to European British subjects detained in custody whether within the limits of <ORG> Original Jurisdiction or outside those limits to apply for an order directing the person detaining him to bring him before <ORG> in other words for an order under Section in the nature of habeas corpus Section provided that neither <ORG>s nor any Judge of such <ORG> shall issue any writ of habeas corpus mainprise de homine replegiando not any other writ of the like nature beyond the Presidency Towns This prohibition cannot in my opinion be confined to the case of European British subjects nor has this been contended before us In <ORG> Criminal Procedure Act Act of in Section set out various purposes for which an order in the nature of habeas corpus might be made and it gave power to <ORG> to make such orders in the case of persons within the limits of their Original Jurisdiction Certain particular matters were excepted it being stated that nothing in this section applies to a person detained under Bengal Regulation of and certain other Regulations But it is quite clear that for the purposes provided for by Section the intention was that relief should be granted under the section and recourse should not be had to the old prerogative writs Rules were made by this Court under Section of the Act cf The subsequent history of the matter is shortly this that when the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended in the Acts of and were comprised in Schedule as enactments repealed by Section but not so as to restore any jurisdiction or form of procedure not existing or followed on the st January Act of The matter remained very much in the same position until when a right was given to everybody within the Appellate Jurisdiction of this Court to make an application under Section of the present Criminal Procedure Code The question which arises is whether for any of the purposes mentioned in what is now Section it is open to an applicant still to say that he will make his application independently of that section altogether for the prerogative writ of habeas corpus on the civil side of <ORG> I observe that it has been stated in certain cases that if there is to be any question of the abolition of this right then the legislature must say so in the most specific terms Whether that be a correct view in a matter of procedure of this kind need not be discussed for the legislature has used the most specific terms and it is plain that <ORG> never intended that the <ORG> in giving relief of this character should for any of the purposes mentioned in Section be at liberty to act under it or under the old procedure But there is no question of applicants having a choice as to whether to be governed by the Indian statute or whether to have recourse to such right as an historical enquiry of some difficulty might disclose as having been the law of <ORG> at a former time Indeed it was stated on very high authority that for one reason or another <ORG>s have come to stand at last in circumstances in which it is a very hard matter to say what are their rights their duties or their use This would have been an exercise of Criminal Jurisdiction and no appeal would lie under Clause of the Letters Patent But the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Supplementary Act of an Act of the Indian legislature expressly provided that the powers conferred by Section of the Code should not be exercised in respect of any person arrested or detained in custody under the Local Act If we limit him to that he would have a right of appeal at the expense of all chance of success I ought here to add that Act of and Act of do not seem to have been brought to the notice of the Judges who took part in deciding In re Nataraja Iyer Mad It can serve no useful purpose now to discuss the correctness of Mr Justice <NAME> decision in the case of <NAME> that habeas corpus could issue to the <NAME> but in so far as he proceeded upon the th clause of the Charter of the opinion of <NAME> in In re <NAME> Mad
