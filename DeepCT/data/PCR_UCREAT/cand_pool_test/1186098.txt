HEADNOTE Sub clause i of rule I of Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules which were framed under Act of pro vides that the lease for all minerals specified in sub clause i of clause a may be renewed by the competent officer for one or more periods not exceeding ten years at one time The appellants had been granted leases for quarrying minor minerals prior to the coming into operation of the Act Their applications for renewal of leases under of the Rules were rejected by the competent authority on the ground that the lands fell under the reserved forests which were governed by the Act In the appeals by special leave it was contended for the appellants that the conditions precedent for the opera tion of the Act were not existing that there was no ques tion of extending for non forest purposes forest lands since their were existing quarry leases in areas which were at the relevant time dereserved forests that they had not committed any breach of the terms of grant nor there were any other factors disentitling them to such renewal that the words may be renewed in i should be read as shall be renewed and so read they make it incum bent on the <ORG> to renew the lease if the lessee so desired and as they had invested large sums of money in mining operations a duty was cast on the authorities to exercise the power granting permission in a manner that they could receive full benefit of their investments For the respondents it was contended that after the coming into operation of Act there was no question of renewal of the leases because it had prevented renewal of lease without the approval of <ORG> Whether the power is one coupled with a duty must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and must be so decided by the <ORG>s in each case While under of the Rules there was power to grant renewal which might have cast a duty on account of the investments made by the appellants in the areas covered by the quarrying leases they could not claim renewals as a matter of right after the Act was brought into force Their applications were rejected on good grounds Therefore the concept that power coupled with duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stands eroded by the mandate of the legislation manifest in the Act The <NAME>udgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> We grant leave in these two special leave applications and dispose of these appeals arising out of the decisions of <ORG> by the judgment herein The two appeals centre round the question of how to strike balance between the need of exploitation of the mineral resources lying hidden in the forests and the pres ervation of the ecological balance and to arrest the growing environmental deterioration and involve common questions of law On or about rd August when the appellant term of lease was about to expire the appellant applied for renewal of lease asper rule of Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules hereinafter called the said Rules The appellant thereafter filed a writ petition in <ORG> The appellant has come up in appeal before this Court from the said decision Revision filed by the appellants against the order of the Collector was rejected by the Director Geology and Mining in and in December writ petition often described as special civil application was filed before <ORG> challeng ing the refusal to renew Both these appeals involve the question whether after coming into operation of Act the appellants were entitled to renewal either first or second of their quarry leases In this connection it is necessary to refer to the Act It recognised that deforestation had been taking place on a large scale in the country and it had thereby caused widespread concern Restriction on the dereservation of for ests or use of forest land for non forest purpose Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in a State no State Government or other authority shall make except with the prior approval of the Central Government any order directing i that any reserved forest within the meaning of the expression reserved forest in any law for the time being in force in that state or any portion thereof shall cease to be reserved ii that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non forest pur pose <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant in the first appeal and <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants in the second appeal contended that there was no question of extending for non forest purposes forest lands The rules provided for the period of the lease renewals and availability of areas already granted and sub clause i of the said rule of the said Rules provides as follows i The lease for all minerals specified in sub clause i of clause a may be renewed by the competent officer for one or more periods and the period of renewal at one time shall not exceed ten years and the total period for which the lease may be renewed shall not exceed twenty years in the aggre gate <NAME> drew our attention to rule of Part VIII page of the Manual which deals with the procedure of granting renewals under the rules On the other hand <NAME> counsel for the respondents in the first appeal and <NAME> counsel for the respondents in the second appeal contended before us that after coming into operation of Act there was no question of renewal of the leases because this Act had prevented renewal of the lease without the approval of <ORG> The Rajasthan Rules provided inter alia as follows Period of lease A mining lease may be grant ed for a period of years unless the appli cant himself desires a shorter period Provided that the period may be extended by the <ORG> for another period not exceeding years with option to the lessee for renewal for another equivalent period in case the lessee guarantees invest ments in machinery equipments and the like at least to the tune of times the value of annual dead rent within years from the grant of such extension Where the lease is so renewed the dead rent and the surface rent shall be fixed by the <ORG> within the limits given in the Second Schedule to these rules and shall in no case exceed twice the origi nal dead rent and surface rent respectively and the royalty shall be charged at the rates in force at the time of renewal Often when a public authority is vested with power the expression may has been construed as shall because power if the conditions for the exercise are fulfilled is coupled with duty May is a permissive or enabling expression but there are cases in which for various reasons as soon as the person who is within the statute is entrusted with the power it becomes his duty to exercise it But the Lord Chancellor explained there may be some thing in the nature of the thing empowered to be done sometimes in the object for which it is to be done some thing in the conditions under which it is to be done some thing in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the power is to be exercised which may couple the power with a duty and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed to exercise that power when called upon to do so Whether the power is one coupled with a duty must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and must be so decided by the courts in each case It was emphasized that none of the appellants had committed any breach of the terms of grant nor were there any other fac tors disentitling them to such renewal While there was power to grant renewal and in these cases there were clauses permitting renewals it might have cast a duty to grant such renewal in the facts and circumstances of the cases specially in view of the investments made by the appellants in the areas covered by the quarrying leases but renewals cannot be claimed as a matter of right for the following reasons The rules dealt with a situation prior to the coming into operation of Act Act was an Act in recog nition of the awareness that deforestation and ecological imbalances as a result of deforestation have become social menaces and further deforestation and ecological imbalances should be prevented Therefore the concept that power coupled with the duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stands eroded by the mandate of the legislation as manifest in Act in the facts and circumstances of these cases The primary duty was to the community and that duty took precedence in our opinion in these cases The obligation to the society must predominate over the obligation to the individuals Furthermore it appears to us from the affidavits in opposition filed on behalf of the respond ents that there were good Founds for not granting the renew al of the lease There a mining lease for winning mica was granted by <ORG> in respect of an area of acres of land which formed part of reserved forest before coming into force of Act The respondent in that case therefore made an application to <ORG> for execution of a Deed of Incorpora tion to include the said minerals also in the lease Though the Act had come into force <ORG> executed the Deed of Incorporation incorporating these items without obtaining prior sanction of <ORG> under section of Act Since the respondent in that case made a statement before the Court that he would carry on the mining operations only on acres of land which had already been utilised for non forest purposes even before the Act came into force the question for determination was whether prior approval of <ORG> under section of Act in the facts of that case was neces sary for <ORG> for granting permission to win associate minerals also within the same area of acres of land This Court answered the question in negative and affirmed the judgment of <ORG> This Court observed at pages and of the report as follows The relevant parts of Section of the Act which have to be construed for pur poses of this case are clause ii of and the Explanation to that section There was an existing lease where mining operation was being carried on and what was due by incorpo ration of a new term was that while mining operations were being carried on some other minerals were available he was given right to collect those If <ORG> is of the opinion that it is not a case where <ORG> should seek approval of <ORG> <ORG> cannot apparently seek such approval in a matter in respect of in our opinion which it has come to the conclusion that no renewal should be granted
