Mr <NAME> for the plaintiff after my judgment <NAME>d been given asked me to re hear argument upon the case in view of the fast t<NAME>t subsequent consideration <NAME>d induced him to think t<NAME>t this assumption was wrong If upon the evidence I thought t<NAME>t it was open to the widow to say t<NAME>t on this question her opportunity for adducing evidence <NAME>d not been in the circumstances complete I should not disturb my previous intention and I should give judgment in her favour He executed the transfer deed which is in evident and as I <NAME>ve held he gave possession of it to his Wife The donor must <NAME>ve done everything which awarding to the nature of the property comprised in the settlement was necessary to be done to transfer the property <NAME> <NAME> De Ch jur In these circumstances I must in this case apply the principle that there is no equity to perfect an imperfect gift and hat the gift having been intended to take effect by waj of transfer the <ORG> will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust The statement that a dead man three year ago had said this or said that is almost inevitable fn such a case I am not in the least prepared to rely upon evidence of <NAME> when he makes a statement of that sort particularly as it not corroborated by the evidence of any her brother Very much the same consideration applies to the witness <NAME> a neighbour of the decased the deceased who in my indgment gave his evidence Ind Even if it be true that this lady brother <NAME> who seems not to be a very reputable person immediately shouted that there was no such thing as shares the moment the shares were mentioned and that immediately thereupon these some what numerous parties assisting in this function got into a state of noise and quarrel while the lady stood by the threshold I am entirely enable to draw any inference useful for the decision of this case from those facts The position shortly is this The one witness apart from the lady evidence who says that <NAME> executed the document now before me that it was years ago in the condition as regards the body of it that it is now in is the broker <NAME> He is corroborated by the evidence of <NAME> in this respect as it would appear from <NAME> evidence that <NAME> signature was on that document in August There is no improbability and merely by reason of the relationship there is all the more probability that he would be called in for that purpose In the Will he expressly says that he has no cash or moveable estate for distribution and I find from the evidence of the share certificate that these shares had been transferred to him as long ago as the with June That is quite true but I am satisfied not only that the transfer deed was signed and witnessed but that it was given effect to by parting with it to the wife with the utontion that from that time she was to be the owner of the shares In the first place there is some presumption that if a man wants to make a gift he will do all that is necessary to effectuate his purpose Every probability it seems to me is in the lady favour Sometimes he made them over to her and sometimes it seems that he spent them I do not know whether on household expenses or upon his own but the mere fact that he paid the dividends as such on any occasion to his wife is corroboration of the gift and there is no doubt having regard to the relationship of the parties that if he did not pay the dividends over as received to his wife he did so by her implied consent or at any rate as between her and him upon the footing that it was with her permission I think under the circumstances that the evidence proves to my satisfaction not only that the document was executed in November but that it was made over to the lady and that there is room for quite sensible reasons why the transfer was not completed by the registration of the shares in the new name The suit will be dismissed with costs on scale Mo
