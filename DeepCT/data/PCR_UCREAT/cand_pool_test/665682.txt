By the impugned Judgment <ORG> partly confirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge and held that Section a i of the Andhra Pradesh Education Act in short the A Act is void and inoperative and the <ORG> Government had no legislative competence to pass such a legislation as the <ORG> provision was in the field already occupied by the enactment made by the <ORG> namely All India Council of Technical Education Act hereinafter being referred to AICTE Act The permission was rejected on the ground that the Writ Petitioners had been seeking permission to establish colleges in the places where already there were number of colleges and that <ORG> was not satisfied about the educational needs of that locality A Act is a consolidating and amending Act made by <ORG> with the object of reforming organising and developing educational system in the <ORG> and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto The <ORG> Government is authorised to appoint by notification a competent authority for such area as may be specified in the notification Sub Section of Section provides that the competent authority appointed by the <ORG> Government shall from time to time conduct a survey for the purpose of identifying the educational needs of the locality under its jurisdiction and thereafter it shall issue notification through the local newspapers calling for applications from the educational agencies desirous of establishing educational institutions Any educational agency applying for such permission shall satisfy the concerned authority that there is need for providing educational facilities to the people in the locality There are some other requirements mentioned in sub Section of Section and those conditions have to be fulfilled by the educational agency for applying of permission for establishing an educational institution a In pursuance of the notification under sub section any educational agency including local authority or registered body or persons intending to a establish an institution imparting education xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Any educational agency applying for permission under sub section shall a before the permission is granted satisfy the authority concerned i that there is need for providing educational facilities to the people in the locality ii iii xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx On and from the commencement of the Andhra Pradesh Education Amendment Act no educational institution shall be established except in accordance with the provisions of the Act The source of legislation of the A Act is traced to Entry of the Concurrent List which is to the following effect Education including technical education medical education and universities subject to the provisions of Entries and of List I vocational and technical training of labour Under Section <ORG> shall appoint a Council called <ORG> and under Section of the Act the Council has the following powers and functions it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to take all such steps as it may think fit ensuring coordinated and integrated development of technical education and maintenance of standards and for the purpose of performing its functions under this Act the council may a undertake survey in the various fields of technical education collect data on all related matters and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education coordinate the development of technical education collect data on all related matters and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education allocate and disburse out of <ORG> such grants on such terms and conditions as it may think fit to i technical institutions and ii promote an effective link between technical education system and other relevant systems including research and development organizations industry and the community evolve suitable performance appraisal systems for technical institutions and universities imparting technical education incorporating norms and mechanisms for enforcing accountability formulate schemes for the initial and in service training of teachers and identify institutions or centres and set up new

staff qualifications quality instructions assessment and examinations fix norms and guidelines for charging tuitions and other fees grant approval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned advice the central government in respect of grant of character to any professional body or institution in the

lay down norms for granting autonomy to technical institutions take all necessary steps to prevent commercialisation of technical education provide guidelines for admission of students to technical institutions and universities imparting education inspect or cause to inspect any technical institutions withhold or discontinue grants in respect of courses programmes to such technical institutions which fails to comply with the directions given by the council within the stipulated period of time and take such other steps as may be necessary for ensuring compliance of the directions of the council take steps to strengthen the existing organizations and to set up new organizations to ensure effective discharge of the council responsibilities and to create positions of professional technical and supporting staff based on requirements declare technical institutions at various levels and types offering course in technical education fit to receive grants advise the commission for declaring any institution imparting technical education as a deemed university set up <ORG> to periodically conduct evaluation of technical institutions or programmes on the basis of guidelines norms and standards specified by it and to make recommendation to it or to the council or to the commission or to other bodies regarding recognition or de recognition of the institution or the programme perform such other functions as may be prescribed The learned Counsel for the <ORG> on the other hand contended that Section of the AP Act and Section of the AICTE Act operate in different fields there is no conflict between these provisions and that they are not repugnant to each other and the decision of <ORG> is erroneous It was also contended by the appellant Counsel that the <ORG> Legislature has legislative competence to pass the enactment and that in view of Entry of the Concurrent List the <ORG> alone would be competent to say whether an institution should be established in an area to serve the educational needs of that locality Article reads as follows Subject matter of laws made by <ORG> and by <ORG> Notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List Notwithstanding anything in clause <ORG> and subject to clause the <ORG> of any state also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the Concurrent List Subject to clauses and the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the State List Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List The <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I notwithstanding anything contained in clauses and of Article The non obstante clause under Article indicates the predominance or supremacy of the law made by the <ORG> legislature in the event of an overlap of the law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List I and a law made by the <ORG> legislature with respect to a matter enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule There is no doubt that both <ORG> and the <ORG> legislature are supreme in their respective assigned fields It is the duty of the <ORG> to interpret the legislations made by the <ORG> and the <ORG> legislature in such a manner as to avoid any conflict However if the conflict is unavoidable and the two enactments are irreconcilable then by the force of the non onbstante clause in Clause of Article the <ORG>ary legislation would prevail notwithstanding the exclusive power of the <ORG> legislature to make a law with respect to a matter enumerated in the <ORG> List Here again the courts are charged with the duty of interpreting the enactments of <ORG> and the <ORG> legislature in such manner as to avoid a conflict If the conflict becomes unavoidable then Article indicates the manner of resolution of such a conflict Thus the question of repugnancy between the <ORG> legislation and the <ORG> legislation can arise in two ways Second where the two legislations are with respect to matters in Concurrent List and there is a conflict In both the situations <ORG> legislation will predominate in the first by virtue of the non obstante clause in Article in the second by reason of Article Clause of Article deals with a situation where the <ORG> legislation having been reserved and having obtained President ascent prevails in that <ORG> this again is subject to the proviso that the <ORG> can again bring a legislation to override even such <ORG> legislation It is in this background that the provisions contained in the two legislative enactments have to be scrutnised Section a i says that before permission is granted the authority concerned must be satisfied that there is need for providing educational facilities to the people in the locality Entry of the Concurrent List gives power to <ORG> to make laws regarding education including technical education The <ORG> has certainly the legislative competence to pass the legislation in respect of education including technical education and Section of the Act is intended for general welfare of the citizens of the <ORG> and also in discharge of the constitutional duty enumerated under Article of the Constitution That there is a clear and direct inconsistency between the Central Act and the State Act That the inconsistency between the provisions of the two Acts is of such a nature as to bring the two Acts into direct collision with each other and a situation is reached where it is impossible to obey the one without disobeying the other Reference was made to <NAME> Vs Allah Rakhia AIR FC wherein it was observed that if the paramount legislation does not purport to be exhaustive or unqualified there is no inconsistency and it cannot be said that any qualification or restriction introduced by another law is repugnant to the provision in the main or paramount law This court also referred to <NAME> Vs <NAME> SCR wherein it was inter alia observed that before coming to the conclusion that there is a repeal by implication the court must be satisfied that the two enactments are so inconsistent that it becomes impossible for them to stand together a if any provisions of law made by the legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact then the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature of the State shall to the extent of repugnancy be void or if any provision of a law made by the legislature of a state is repugnant to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the legislature of the State shall to the extent of repugnancy be void There cannot be any doubt that the article gives supremacy to the law made by the <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact but for application of this article firstly there must be repugnancy between the <ORG> law and the law made by <ORG> Secondly if there is repugnancy the <ORG> legislation would be void only to the extent of repugnancy If there is no repugnancy between the two laws there is no question of application of Article and both Acts would prevail The power to legislate is given to the appropriate legislatures by Article and other articles Thus the function of entries in three lists of the Seventh Schedule is to demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislatures can enact laws but does not confer power either on <ORG> or <ORG> to enact laws It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they do not forego or discard the principle of merit It would therefore be permissible for the university or the <ORG> at the time of granting recognition to require a private unaided institution to provide for merit based selection while at the same time giving the management sufficient discretion in admitting students This can be done through various methods For instance a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by the State university and have applied to the college concerned for admission while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counseling by State agency This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society The prescription of percentage of this purpose has to be done by the <ORG> according to the local needs and different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority aided and professional colleges The same principles may be applied to other non professional but unaided educational institutions viz Moreover the decision if any taken by the <ORG> authorities under Section a i would be subject to judicial review and we do not think that the <ORG> could make any irrational decision about granting permission Hence we hold that Section a i is not in any way repugnant to Section of AICTE Act and it is constitutionally valid In the result we set aside the judgment of <ORG> and the appeals are allowed accordingly
