Section of the Act provides that the <ORG> shall take cognizance of or try cases as are instituted before it or transferred to it Section provides for appointment and functions of custodian Section provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of <ORG> and stipulates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law any prosecution in respect of any offence referred to in sub section of Section shall be instituted only in the <ORG> and any prosecution in respect of such offence pending in any court shall stand transferred to the <ORG> Section of the Act lays down the procedure and powers of <ORG> and stipulates the following of the procedure prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases before a Magistrate Procedure and powers of <ORG> <ORG> shall in the trial of such cases follow the procedure prescribed by the <ORG> for the trial of warrant cases before a magistrate Save as expressly provided in this Act the provisions of the Code shall insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act apply to the proceedings before <ORG> and for the purposes of the said provisions of the Code <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> and shall have all the powers of <ORG> and the person conducting a prosecution before <ORG> shall be deemed to be a Public Prosecutor The Act has an overriding effect as provided in Section which inter alia stipulates that the provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force It is claimed that in those statements they voluntarily and willingly made full disclosure of their participation in the offences and also participation of other accused in commission of the offences The investigating officer supporting the application for grant of pardon stated before <ORG> that with a view to obtain the evidence of these two accused who are directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to offences which were under investigation it is necessary and desirable as well as in the interests of justice that there applications praying for tender of pardon to them be supported so that all the facts and circumstances relating to the commission of offences and also the manner of participation by other accused may come on record during the trial <ORG> by order dated nd June granted the application of both the accused on the condition that they will give evidence during the trial and make a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within their knowledge relating to the offence and to other problems It was urged that the power to grant pardon had to be expressly conferred there is no inherent power in any court to grant pardon and that no such power had been conferred on <ORG> The applications seeking revocation were dismissed by <ORG> by order dated th February holding that <ORG> has the power to tender pardon Chapter XXIV of the Code deals with the general provisions as to inquiries and trials Section confers power on Magistrates and Section on the court to which the commitment is made With a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence to which this section applies the Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at any stage of the investigation or inquiry into or the trial of the offence and the Magistrate of the first class inquiring into or trying the offence at any stage of the inquiry or trial may tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relative to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commission thereof This section applies to a any offence triable exclusively by <ORG> or by the Court of a Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act any offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or with a more severe sentence Every person accepting a tender of pardon made under sub section a shall be examined as a witness in <ORG> taking cognizance of the offence and in the subsequent trial if any shall unless he is already on bail be detained in custody until the termination of the trial Where a person has accepted a tender of pardon made under sub section and has been examined under sub section the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence shall without making any further inquiry in the case a commit it for trial i to the Court of Session if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court or if the Magistrate taking cognizance is the Chief Judicial Magistrate ii to a Court of Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court in any other case make over the case to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who shall try the case himself At any time after commitment of a case but before judgment is passed the Court to which the commitment is made may with a view to obtaining at the trial the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to any such offence tender a pardon on the same condition to such person Any statement made by such person accepting the tender of pardon and recorded by a Magistrate under section or by a Court under sub section of section may be given in evidence against him at such trial If the accused does so plead the <ORG> shall record the plea and proceed with the trial and it shall before passing judgment in the case find whether or not the accused has complied with the conditions of the pardon and if it finds that he has so complied it shall notwithstanding anything contained in this Code pass judgment of acquittal We were also told that in Criminal Appeal No of <NAME> <ORG> one of the questions is as to the power of a Magistrate to grant pardon to a person accused of an offence that falls within the purview of the Act Section confers the power to grant pardon in respect of serious offences and on certain class of Magistrate From the scheme of the section and having regard to the nature of the power we find that Mr <NAME> is right in contending that the power to grant pardon is not an inherent power of a criminal court and is a substantive power to be specifically conferred It confers inherent powers on the <ORG> to deal with any matter that may be brought before it providing that for dealing with such a matter the <ORG> may adopt its own procedure consistent with the principles of natural justice The conferment of that inherent power does not include the power to grant pardon which cannot be said to be a matter of procedure Whether it is so excluded by necessary implication is an aspect which needs serious consideration Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellant contends that Sections and have not been extended to <ORG> under the Act Therefore the contention is that neither Section nor Section is applicable to the proceedings before <ORG> under the Act and hence that court has no power or jurisdiction to tender pardon Learned counsel further contends that it was a matter of policy for the law makers to confer or not upon <ORG> such a power and in their wisdom probably considering the gravity of the offence and situation with which the country was confronted it took a policy decision not to confer power of pardon so that no one should escape punishment and every accused is equally treated Learned counsel contends that this course was adopted by the legislature despite the fact that law makers were fully conscious that in all similar earlier enactments power to grant pardon was specifically conferred by insertion of specific provision to that effect while passing law establishing <ORG> While enacting the Act the provision conferring power to grant pardon was deliberately omitted and this almost conclusively shows that such power was not intended to be conferred is the submission of Mr <NAME> Reference has been made by learned counsel in particular to Section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act for short the Act A Special Judge may take cognizances of offence without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrate A Special Judge may with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commission thereof and any person so tendered shall for the purposes of Secs Save as provided in sub section or sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure of shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor A In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sub section the provisions of Sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as may be apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions of Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate A special Judge may pass upon any person convicted by him any sentence authorized by law for the punishment of the offence of which such person is convicted Mr <NAME> contends that for all intents and purposes the aforesaid provisions have been repeated while enacting Section of the Act but by not providing in Section a provision similar to abovesaid Section conferring on <ORG> under the Act power to grant pardon almost conclusively shows the legislative intendment of not conferring power of pardon on <ORG> Section thereof provides for procedure and powers of <ORG>s established under the said Act It confers on <ORG> power to tender pardon as stipulated in sub section of Section of that Act which is similar to Section of the Act The submission is that the Act does not postulate any commitment to be made to <ORG> for it provides for the institution of or transfer of a case before <ORG> and institution of any prosecution in respect of any offence referred to in Section only in <ORG> Sections and In <NAME> case the <ORG> said that shorn of all embellishment <ORG> is a court of original criminal jurisdiction and to make it functionally oriented some powers were conferred by the statute setting it up and except those specifically conferred and specifically denied it has to function as a court of original criminal jurisdiction not being hide bound by the terminological status description of Magistrates or <ORG> Under the Code it will enjoy all powers which a court of original criminal jurisdiction enjoys save and except the ones specifically denied Therefore let us see whether the power to grant pardon has been specifically denied to <ORG> established by the Act The relevant passage reads thus Before we discuss the validity or propriety of the tender of pardon to <NAME> we shall refer briefly to the statutory provisions on the subject of the tender of pardon Sections to and A contain all the provisions which refer to courts of criminal jurisdiction established under the Code The Special Judge is empowered to take cognizances of the offences without the accused being committed to him for trial The jurisdiction to try the offence by a Sessions Judge is only after committal to him The Special Judge is deemed to be a Court of Sessions only for certain purposes as mentioned in Section of the Act while the first part of sub section provides that except as provided in sub sections and of Section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before the Special Judge The sub section further provides that for the purpose of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a special judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor The deemed provisions has to be confined for the purposes mentioned in the sub section Section enables the Special Judge to tender a pardon to a person with a view to obtaining evidence supposed to have been concerned for the commission of an offence and the pardon so tendered was for the purposes of Section and a of the Code of Criminal Procedure This provision also is made specifically applicable to the Special Judge Section A empowers the Special Judge to try certain offences in a summary way and the provisions of section to of the Criminal Procedure Code is made applicable so far as they may apply The contention of learned counsel is that in the case in hand the Act does not postulate commitment of the case being made to <ORG> and no provision having been inserted in the Act to empower <ORG> to tender pardon the impugned order granting pardon is without jurisdiction The submission is that a reading of the provisions of the Act clearly shows that the power as contained in Section of the Code to punish the accomplice for violation of the terms and conditions of the pardon has not been conferred on <ORG> and therefore it is evident that the power to tender pardon has also not been conferred on that court Counsel submits that for deciding these matters the paramount question one is required to ask himself is why provisions similar to the one in Act and other such enactments conferring specific power to grant pardon and to inflict punishment in the event of violation of the terms and conditions of the pardon were omitted from the Act Pointing out that the Code is a general law and the Act a special later enactment Section whereof shows its predominance and superiority this <ORG> should not have any reluctance to accept the applicability of doctrine of implied repeal in these matters was the submission of learned counsel though he very fairly and rightly conceded that there is a presumption against a repeal by implication Relying upon statutory interpretation by <NAME> Edition counsel contends that where as in the present case the provisions of the later enactment the Act are contrary to those of the earlier the Code the later by implication repeals the earlier in accordance with the maxim leges posteriores priores contrerios abrogant later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws The contention is that the provisions of Sections and cannot be complied with by <ORG> and thus the legislature while enacting the Act clearly intended that the said existing provisions of the Code would not apply the proceedings under the Act Learned counsel contends that this court will not construe the Act in a manner which will make Sections and or at least part of the said sections otiose and thereby defeat the legislative intendment whatever be the consequences of such an interpretation AIR SC A BENCH OF SEVEN JUDGES SAID But there is one principle on which there is complete unanimity of all the courts in the world and this is that where the words or the language used in a statute are clear and cloudless plain simple and explicit unclouded and unobscured intelligible and pointed so as to admit of no ambiguity vagueness uncertainty or equivocation there is absolutely no room for deriving support from external aids There is no doubt that if the words are plain and simple and call for only one construction that construction is to be adopted whatever be its effect The question in the present case however is can it be said from the plain language of the Act that the power to grant pardon has been excluded from the purview of <ORG> either expressly or by necessary implication by not incorporating in Section of the Act a provision similar to Section of the Act There cannot be any controversy that there is no express provision in the Act excluding therefrom the applicability of Sections and of the Code THERE IS A DEPARTURE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS TO OF THE CODE ON ONE HAND AND SECTIONS TO A OF CODE ON THE OTHER Now under Section there is no power to so order the committing Magistrate the question for consideration was whether a District Magistrate is competent under Section of the old Code to exercise power of pardon even after commitment and the conferment of the power to grant pardon on the Special Judge under Section It was held that Section does not deprive the District Magistrate of his power to grant pardon under Section of the old Code This Court said that even after commitment a District Magistrate will have power to grant pardon though it was necessary to bear in mind that the authorities under Sections and have to exercise jurisdiction in harmony in order to further the interest of justice and avoid conflicting orders being passed This Court upholding the order of <ORG> dismissing the revision petition of the co accused challenging the order granting pardon to <NAME> noticed that before <ORG> the prosecution had supported grant of pardon to him It was held that the fiction in latter part of Section providing that pardon sought under law for the purposes of Sections and A of the Code be deemed to have been tendered under Section of that Code is only that the tender of pardon is deemed to be one under Section for purposes of applying Sections and A After noticing the distinction between the powers granted under the Code and the powers under the Act to tender pardon it was held that the conditions for exercise of the power by the Courts under the Code are not applicable when the Special Judge exercises that power whose powers are not circumscribed by any condition except one namely that action must be with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence There was distinction in exercise of the power under the two provisions which were under consideration before <ORG> which is evident from the following It follows that the powers of the Special Judge are not circumscribed by any condition except one namely that the action must be with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence The pardon so tendered is also on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor There is no provision for the recording of reasons for so doing nor is the Special Judge required to furnish a copy to the accused There is no provision for recording a preliminary statement of the person The power so conferred can also be exercised at any time after the case is received for trial and before its conclusion There is nothing in the language of the section to show that the Special Judge must be moved by the prosecution It does not follow therefrom that in an altogether different statute if no special provision is made an inference can be drawn that even where the powers under the Code and not wide powers were intended to be conferred save and except where it is so stated specifically the effect of omission would be that <ORG> will not have even similar power as are exercised by the ordinary criminal courts under the Code Similarly the observations made in the earlier reproduced passage in <NAME> case have also to be appreciated in the context of what we have said above regarding the conferment of wider power than the Code under the Act It is in this context that the observations were made in that case to the effect that This sub section was enacted because the Special Judge not being a court to which a commitment has been made cannot tender pardon under the provisions of Section and so this sub section is introduced to enable the Special Judge to tender a pardon THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER ASPECT OF KRISHNNASWAMI NAIDU CASE AND THAT IS IN RELATION TO SECTION OF THE CODE IN THAT CASE WHILE NOTICING THAT SECTION OF THE CODE REQUIRES THAT WHENEVER ANY PERSON IS ARRESTED AND DETAINED IN CUSTODY AND WHEN IT APPEARS THAT THE INVESTIGATION CANNOT BE COMPLETED WITHIN A PERIOD OF HOURS THE POLICE OFFICER IS REQUIRED TO FORWARD THE ACCUSED TO THE MAGISTRATE AND IF THE MAGISTRATE TO WHOM THE ACCUSED IS FORWARDED IS NOT THE MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE HE MAY AUTHORIZE THE DETENTION OF THE ACCUSED IN SUCH CUSTODY AS HE THINKS FIT FOR A TERM NOT EXCEEDING DAYS ON THE WHOLE IF HE HAS NO JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE AND IF HE CONSIDERS THAT THE FURTHER DETENTION IS NECESSARY HE MAY ORDER THE ACCUSED TO BE FORWARDED TO ANY MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION WHO MAY AUTHORIZE DETENTION OF THE KIND PROVIDED BEYOND PERIOD OF DAYS BUT FOR A TOTAL PERIOD NOT EXCEEDING DAYS THE ACCUSED IN THAT CASE WERE PRODUCED BEFORE THE SPECIAL JUDGE WHO HAD THE JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE THE CONTENTION WHICH FOUND FAVOUR WITH THE HIGH COURT WAS THAT THE WORDS MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION CANNOT APPLY TO A SPECIAL JUDGE HAVING JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE IT WAS HELD IN THIS CASE THAT NO DOUBT THE WORD SPECIAL JUDGE IS NOT MENTIONED IN SECTION BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT WOULD EXCLUDE THE SPECIAL JUDGE FROM BEING A MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE ON EXAMINING VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE CODE INCLUDING SECTION THEREOF IT WAS HELD THAT IN TAKING COGNIZANCE OF AN OFFENCE WITHOUT THE ACCUSED BEING COMMITTED TO HIM HE IS NOT A SESSIONS JUDGE FOR SECTION OF THE CODE PROVIDES THAT NO COURT OF SESSIONS JUDGE SHALL TAKE COGNIZANCE FOR ANY OFFENCE AS A COURT OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION UNLESS THE CASE HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO IT BY A MAGISTRATE UNDER THE CODE AND STRICTLY HE IS NOT A SESSIONS JUDGE FOR NO SESSIONS JUDGE CAN TAKE A COGNIZANCE AS A COURT OF SESSION WITHOUT COMMITTAL REFERRING TO THE CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT IT WAS HELD THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE CODE ARE NOT EXCLUDED UNLESS THEY ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT AND THUS READ THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CODE IS APPLICABLE WHEN THERE IS NO CONFLICT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT THE CONTENTION URGED BY <NAME> THAT AT PRE COGNIZANCE STAGE SPECIAL COURT UNDER THE ACT HAS NO JURISDICTION CLEARLY RUNS CONTRARY TO THE AFORESAID DICTUM IT WAS SAID THAT TO HOLD THAT A MAGISTRATE OTHER THAN A MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION CANNOT KEEP HIM IN CUSTODY FOR MORE THAN DAYS AND AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD IF THE MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SPECIAL JUDGE IT WOULD MEAN THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO EXTEND THE PERIOD OF REMAND OR TO RELEASE HIM ON BAIL REFERRING TO CLAUSE OF SECTION OF THE GENERAL CLAUSES ACT AND SECTION OF THE CODE IT WAS HELD THAT THERE CAN BE NO DIFFICULTY IN CONSTRUING THE SPECIAL JUDGE AS A MAGISTRATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECTION AND THUS REJECTING THE CONTENTION AND REVERSING THE ARGUMENTS WHICH WEIGHED WITH THE HIGH COURT THAT THE WORDS MAGISTRATE HAVING JURISDICTION CANNOT APPLY TO A SPECIAL JUDGE HAVING JURISDICTION TO TRY THE CASE THIS COURT HELD It is relevant to note that the General Clauses Act Section defines a Magistrate as including every person exercising all or any of the powers of a Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure for the time being in force It does not appear from the language of Sections and read with Sections and that at pre cognizance stage all steps including those of remand bail are required to be taken before the normal criminal courts constituted under Section of the Code Further admittedly in practice all such proceedings including those of remand bail production of the accused at pre cognizance stage have always been taken before <ORG> and not before criminal courts constituted under the Code It also does not appear that a Magistrate has a power to grant pardon under Section to alleged offenders under the Act at any stage of the proceedings SUCH A POWER WAS CONFERRED ON COURT OF ORIGINAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION WITH WHICH THIS COURT WAS CONCERNED IN <NAME> CASE AND HAS NOT BEEN CONFERRED ON THE COURT OF ORIGINAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED IS THE CONTENTION OF <NAME> REGARDING SECTION PRESCRIBING THE POWER OF THE COURT THREE REASONS ARE GIVEN BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL IN SUPPORT OF THE SUBMISSION THAT THE SAID PROVISION HAS NOT BEEN EXTENDED TO THE SPECIAL COURT NAMELY NO COMMITMENT IS MADE TO THE SPECIAL COURT IT OPERATES AFTER COMMITMENT AND ONLY THEREAFTER THE COURT WILL HAVE POWER TO GRANT <NAME> AND IT DOES NOT CONFER POWER TO GRANT <NAME> DURING INVESTIGATION OF THE OFFENCE IT WAS SUBMITTED THAT IN THESE APPEALS THE <NAME> WAS GRANTED DURING INVESTIGATION AS THE ORDER WAS PASSED BY SPECIAL COURT GRANTING <NAME> ON ND JUNE WHEREAS THE CHARGE SHEET WAS FILED LATER I ON TH JUNE Section a postulates that every person accepting a tender of pardon made under sub section of Section shall be examined as a witness in the court of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence and in the subsequent trial if any Here it is pointed out the cognizance cannot be taken by the Magistrate in view of Sections and of the Act and it can be exclusively taken by <ORG> and therefore this section becomes redundant is the contention Mr <NAME> however does not dispute the applicability of Section subject to superiority of the Act as postulated in Section of the Act but submits that the effect of it only is that at pre cognizance stage it is the normal court of criminal jurisdiction as constituted under Section which would have power and jurisdiction to deal with matters at pre cognizance stage and not <ORG> To a query from this Court that if it is so would not such normal court have power under Section of the Code to grant pardon the answer of Mr <NAME> is that those courts will not have the said powers since the legislature intended to exclude that power from <ORG> it would be evident that it also intended to so exclude normal courts as well Alternatively it was contended that assuming such powers at pre cognizance stage vest with normal courts it does not mean that <ORG> would also have the power of pardon There is no anomaly in grant of power of pardon at the stage of investigation and enquiry and denial of such power at the stage of trial to <ORG> as it is a question of policy according to Mr <NAME> It is not possible to accept that the legislature could ever intend to create such a anomalous position where a Magistrate will have power to grant pardon at pre cognizance stage but after cognizance <ORG> will not have that power IN ANY CASE LEARNED COUNSEL CONTENDS THAT THE COURT WILL NOT CONSTRUE THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT IN A MANNER WHICH WILL MAKE SUB SECTIONS AND OF THE CODE REDUNDANT IN ITS APPLICABILITY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SPECIAL LAW NAMELY THE ACT AIR SC IT WAS CONTENDED THAT THERE IS A PRESUMPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE INSERTS EVERY PART OF A STATUTE FOR A PURPOSE AND THAT EVERY PART SHOULD HAVE EFFECT AND SINCE SUB SECTIONS AND OF SECTION WOULD NOT HAVE EFFECT AS THOSE SUB SECTIONS CANNOT BE COMPLIED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE POWER OF SECTION WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE CONFERRED ON THE SPECIAL COURT BY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THAT COURT WITH EXCLUSIVE POWER OF COGNIZANCE CANNOT COMPLY WITH SECTION OF THE CODE To our mind <ORG> has all the powers of <ORG> and or Magistrate as the case may be after the prosecution is instituted or transferred before that Court The width of the power of <ORG> will be same whether trying such cases as are instituted before it or transferred to it Learned counsel submitted that the report under that Section is required to be sent to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of offence In relation to offence under the Act the Magistrate has no power to take cognizance This section rather provides that the provisions of the Code shall apply to the proceedings before <ORG> There is nothing in the Act to show that Sections to were intended to be excluded from the purview of the Act The Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted for more effective prevention of bribery and corruption Years rolled by and experience gathered showed that unless a special forum for the trial of such offences as enumerated in the Act is created the object underlying the Act would remain a distant dream This led to the enactment of the Criminal Law accompanying the Bill refers to the recommendations of the Committee chaired by Dr <NAME> appointed to review the working of <ORG> and to make recommendations for improvement of laws relating to bribery and corruption To take the cases of corruption out of the maze of cases handled by Magistrates it was decided to set up special courts Section conferred power on the State Government to appoint as many Special Judges as may be necessary with power to try the offences set out in clauses a and Now if at this state a reference is made to Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides for constitution of criminal courts it would become clear that a new court with a new designation was being set up and that it has to be under the administrative and judicial superintendence of the High <ORG> As already pointed out there were four types of criminal courts functioning under the High <ORG> Now when a new court which is indisputably a criminal court because it was not even whispered that the <ORG> of Special Judge is not a criminal court is set up to make it effective and functionally oriented it becomes necessary to prescribe its powers procedure status and all ancillary provisions While setting up a court of a Special Judge keeping in view the fact that the high dignitaries in public life are likely to be tried by such a court the qualification prescribed was that the person to be appointed as a Special Judge has to be either a Sessions Judge Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge After prescribing the qualification the <ORG> proceeded to confer power upon a Special Judge to take cognizance of offences for the trial of which a Special court with exclusive jurisdiction was being set up Now the Code prescribes different procedures for trial of cases by different courts Procedure for trial of a case before a <ORG> of Sessions is set out in Chapter XVIII trial of warrant cases by Magistrates is set out in Chapter XIX and the provisions therein included catered to both the types of cases coming before the Magistrate namely upon police report or otherwise than on a police report Chapter XX prescribes the procedure for trial of summons cases by Magistrates and Chapter XXI prescribes the procedure for summary trial Now that a new criminal court was being set up the <ORG> took the first step of providing its comparative position in the hierarchy of courts under Section by bringing it on level more or less comparable to the <ORG> of Sessions but in order to avoid any confusion arising out of comparison by level it was made explicit in Section itself that it is not a <ORG> of Sessions because it can take cognizance of offences without commitment as contemplated by Section Undoubtedly in Section it was clearly laid down that subject to the provisions of sub sections and of Section the <ORG> of Special Judge shall be deemed to be a <ORG> of Session trying cases without jury or without the aid of assessors The <ORG> then proceeded to specify which out of the various procedures set out in the Code this new court shall follow for trial of offences before it A glance through the provisions will show that the provisions therein included catered to both the situations namely trial of a case initiated upon police report Sec If a Special Judge is enjoined with a duty to try cases according to the procedure prescribed in foregoing provisions he will have to first decide whether the case was instituted upon a police report or otherwise than on police report and follow the procedure in the relevant group of sections In fact in order to give full effect to Section the only thing to do is to read Special Judge in Sections to wherever the expression Magistrate occurs This is what is called legislation by incorporation Similarly where the question of taking cognizance arises it is futile to go in search of the fact whether for purposes of Section which conferred power on the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence Special Judge is a Magistrate What is to be done is that one has to read the expression Special Judge in place of Magistrate and the whole thing becomes crystal clear The <ORG> wherever it found the grey area clarified it by making specific provision such as the one in sub section of Section and to leave no one in doubt further provided in sub section that all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge It did not envisage any <ORG> of a Special Judge and the <ORG> never wanted to draw up an exhaustive Code of Procedure for this new criminal court which was being set up Therefore it conferred power taking cognizance of offences prescribed procedure trial of warrant cases by a Magistrate indicated authority to tender pardon Section and then after declaring its status as comparable to a <ORG> of Session proceeded to prescribe that all provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure will apply in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act The net outcome of this position is that a new court of original jurisdiction was set up and whenever a question arose as to what are its powers in respect of specific questions brought before it as court of original criminal jurisdiction it had to refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure undaunted by any designation claptrap The entire argument inviting us to specifically decide whether a court of a Special Judge for a certain purpose is a <ORG> of Magistrate or a <ORG> of Session revolves round a mistaken belief that a Special Judge has to be one or the other and must fit in the slot of a Magistrate or a <ORG> of Session Such an approach would strangulate the functioning of the court and must be eschewed As a court of original criminal jurisdiction in order to make it functionally oriented some powers were conferred by the statute setting up the court Except those specifically conferred and specifically denied it has to function as a court of original criminal jurisdiction not being hide bound by the terminological status description of Magistrate or a <ORG> of Session Under the Code it will enjoy all powers which a court of original criminal jurisdiction enjoys save and except the ones specifically denied The power to grant pardon has not been denied expressly or by necessary implication As earlier stated after decision in the case of <NAME> it was not necessary to make specific provision in the Act conferring power on <ORG> to grant pardon at trial or pre trial stage There is no provision in the Act which negates the power of <ORG> to grant pardon <ORG> has power to grant pardon at any stage of the proceedings Learned Solicitor General in our view rightly contends that the other statutes are only an external aid to the interpretation and to rely upon the omission of a provision which is contained in another different enactment it has to be shown that two acts are similar which is not the position here As noticed the provisions of Sections and of <ORG>s Act confer much wider power There is nothing in those provisions or in Section to warrant exclusion of Sections to of the Code from the purview of the Act Reference may also be made to Section of the Code which stipulates that the investigation inquiry and trial of all offences under any other law than the Indian Penal Code shall also be dealt with according to the provisions of the Code but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating enquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences In that case one of the question that came up for consideration was whether the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to authorize detention of an arrestee produced before him either in judicial custody or otherwise under Section of the Code is completely excluded or ousted by the absence of any specific provision in the FERA or the Customs Act empowering the Magistrate to authorise the detention of the arrestee under the Code It was held that the provisions of the Code would be applicable to the extent in the absence of any contrary provision in the Special Act or any special provision excluding the jurisdiction or applicability of the Code The fact that there is no commitment to <ORG> only shows that section will apply to the extent applicable but that does not lead to exclusion of the power of <ORG> to grant pardon It is <ORG> which is to take cognizance of the cases instituted before it or transferred to it Provisions of the Code not inconsistent with the Act shall apply to the proceedings before <ORG> Section These provisions only show that where there is no commitment sub section of Section will not apply It only means that these provisions will apply to the extent applicable The contention urged on behalf of the appellants before <ORG> was that the Special Magistrate on grant of pardon by virtue of sub section a which provided that in every case where a person has accepted a tender of pardon and has been examined under sub section the Magistrate before whom the proceedings are pending shall if he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is guilty of an offence commit him for trial to the Court of Session or <ORG> as the case may be The Court held that it is not infrequently happens in a trial that the only way in which justice can be done is through one of the accused giving evidence on behalf of the Crown and if this evidence is given according to law there is nothing wrong in it though as the evidence of an accomplice it is open to suspicion and that Section provides the terms on and the machinery by which the pardon for the purpose of giving evidence can be granted by the Magistrate and the Magistrate was acting within his powers in granting the conditional pardon The said provision provided that the provisions of the Code so far as they are not inconsistent with the Chapter i Chapter shall apply to the proceedings of a Special Magistrate and Section of the said Act provided that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in so far as they may be applicable and insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter i Chapter shall apply to all matters connected with arising from or consequent upon a trial by Special Magistrates Sections and of the Ordinance as reproduced in that decision read as under In the trial of any case under this Ordinance a Special Magistrate shall follow the procedure laid down in sub section of Section for the trial of cases by a Special Judge In matters not coming within the scope of sub section the provisions of the Code in so far as they are not inconsistent with this Ordinance shall apply to the proceedings of a Special Magistrate and for the purposes of the said provisions the Special Magistrate shall be deemed to be a Magistrate of the first class The provisions of the Code and of any other law for the time being in force in so far as they may be applicable and in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to all matters connected with arising from or consequent upon a trial by special criminal Courts constituted under this Ordinance The observations of the Chief Justice <NAME> from that decision which was cited with approval by <ORG> are to the following effect It is right to notice the contention that was put forward to the effect that the proceedings before the Special Magistrate were bad When we look at the Ordinance we find that there is an express provision that the provisions of the Code are to apply in the case of Special Magistrates so far as they are not inconsistent with the Ordinance and similar phrasing is used more elaborately in and also in connection with Sessions Judges in It makes no difference whatever so far as I can see whether the Magistrate tendering the pardon had been the District Magistrate and not the Magistrates trying the case But it is quite clear that in so far as the Ordinance is inconsistent with sub A the Ordinance prevails and there is no ground for supposing that it is impossible for the Special Magistrate to hear the evidence As already held these sub sections do not control the power to grant pardon If in such situation the matters of procedure are not applicable it would not negate the
