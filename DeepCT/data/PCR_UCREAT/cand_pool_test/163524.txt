Vs RESPONDENT SRIYANESH KNITTERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH CBanerjee Kripal JUDGMENT KIRPAL The common question involved in these appeals is whether the appellant Board of Trustees of the Port Trust constituted under the Major Port Trusts Act for short the MPT Act have a general lien for their dues over the present or future consignments imported by the importers at the Bombay Port when the said dues are in respect of the past imports made by the said importers The respondents then filed writ petitions under Article of the Constitution of India in <ORG> seeking a declaration that the aforesaid circular was ultra virus of MPT Act and was violative of Articles and A of the Constitution of India The contention of the respondents before <ORG> was that the appellants were not entitled to claim general lien under Section of the Contract Act inter alia for the reason that there was no existing contractual relationship between the appellants and the respondents <ORG> held as under a There is no right of general lien in favour of <ORG> under the provisions of <ORG> Act Such lien shall have priority over all other liens and claims except for general average and for the ship owners lien upon the said goods for freight and other charges where such lien exists and has been preserved in the manner provided in sub section of Section and for money payable to the Central Government under any law for the time being in force relating to customs other than by way of penalty or fine Sale of goods after two months if rates or rent are not paid or lien for freight is not discharged A Board may after the expiry of two months from the time when any goods have passed into its custody or in the case of animals and perishable or hazardous goods after the expiry of such shorter period not being less than twenty four hours after the landing of the animals or goods as the Board may think fit sell by public auction or in such case as the Board considers it necessary so to do for reasons to be recorded in writing sell by tender private agreement or in any other manner such goods or so much thereof as in the opinion of the Board may be necessary a if any rates payable to the Board in respect of such goods have not been paid or if any rent payable to the <ORG> in respect of any place on or in which such goods have been stored has not been paid or if any lien of any ship owner for freight or other charges of which notice has been given has not been discharged and if the person claiming such lien for freight or other charge has made to the <ORG> an application for such sale Plain reading of Section shows that in respect of any goods which are imported the <ORG> has a lien for the amount of all rates leviable under the Act and for the rent due to it and it also has a lien on such goods and the <ORG> may seize and detain the same until such rates are paid It is clear that it is only in respect of the amount due qua the goods imported and existing there that the <ORG> has alien under Section The words such goods in Section has reference to those goods in respect of which rates due to the <ORG> have not been fully paid It was then contended on behalf of the appellants that as wharfingers they are entitled to a general lien under Section of the Contract Act In this connection it was submitted that <ORG> erred in coming to the conclusion that the MPT Act was a complete code in itself and that Section of the Contract Act was not applicable It is an Act which makes provision for the constitution of port authorities and vests the administrative control and management of such ports in such authorities and provides for matters connected therewith This is evident from the following provisions a Section provides that the provisions of the Industrial Act or any other law for the time being in force will not apply to the claim for compensation made by an employee whose services are transferred to the <ORG> <ORG> has rightly come to the conclusion that the MPT Act and Sections and in particular do not give to the appellants the general lien which it is claiming There is another aspect which is relevant On the other hand in respect of current dues in respect of existing goods in their possession the <ORG> not only has a lien under Section of the MPT Act but it also has the power to sell the said goods and realise its dues by virtue of Section of the MPT Act The procedure for exercising this power of sale of the goods in respect of which the <ORG> has lien is contained in the said section Section of the Indian Contract Act reads as follows General lien of bankers factors wharfingers attorneys and policy brokers Bankers factors wharfingers attorneys of <ORG> and policy brokers may in the absence of a contract to the contrary retain as a security for a general balance of account any goods bailed to them but no other persons have a right to retain as a security for such balance goods bailed to them unless there is an express contract to that effect It provides that they will have no right to retain as securities bailed to them unless there is an express contract to that effect Whereas in respect of the first category of person mentioned in Section section itself enables them to retain the goods as security in the absence of a contract to the contrary but in respect of any other person to whom goods are bailed the right of retaining them as securities can be exercised only if there is an express contract to that effect Performance of services by Board or other person A Board shall have power to undertake the following services a landing shipping or transshipping passengers and goods between vessels in the port and the wharves piers quays or docks belonging to or in the possession of the <ORG> receiving removing shifting transporting storing or delivering goods brought within the Boards premises carrying passengers by rail or by other means within the limits of the port or port approaches subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Central Government may think fit to impose receiving and delivering transporting and booking and despatching goods originating in the vessels in the port and intended for carriage by the neighbouring railways or vice versa as a railway administration under the Indian Railways Act and piloting hauling mooring remorring hooking or measuring of vessels or any other service in respect of vessels A <ORG> shall not be in any way responsible for the loss destruction or deterioration of or damage to goods of which it has taken charge unless notice of such loss or damage has been given within such period as may be prescribed by regulations made in this behalf from the date of taking charge of such goods by the <ORG> under sub section of section For the use of property belonging to <ORG> including for leasing of land or sheds by owners of goods imported or intended for export or for any other use of land building etc We may here notice that in exercise of the powers conferred by Section read with Sections and of the MPT Act <ORG> issued a notification dated st February notifying the Port of Bombay Responsibility for Goods Regulations This decision has no relevance to the point in issue which has to be decided in the present case Section contains the definition of owner It was also contended on behalf of the respondents that even if Section of the Contract Act applies the appellants can exercise their lien under Section of the Contract Act for the recovery of their dues for the services rendered by them as wharfingers only and not for any other services provided by them as detailed in the MPT Act Attractive as it may appear we do not find any merit in the aforesaid submission In other words the services which are undertaken under Section have to be paid for and any amount due in respect thereof will be regarded as general balance of account There is no reason to give a restricted meaning to the expression general balance of account to mean only wharfage charges which according to the respondents would imply the charges for loading or unloading of goods and would not include demurrage We accordingly allow these appeals and set aside the judgment of <ORG> with the result that the writ petitions filed by the respondents in <ORG> stand dismissed The appeals are allowed with costs throughout
