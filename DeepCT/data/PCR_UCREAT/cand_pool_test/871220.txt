HEADNOTE The appellant is a limited company which is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of sugar and it has a cold storage plant and a steel foundry With reference to a news item dated th October in <ORG> in which it was stated that the State of Uttar Pradesh had decided to give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under section A of the Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the State with a view to enabling them to come on firm footing in developing stage the appellant addressed a letter dated th October to <NAME> stating that in view of the sales tax holiday announced by the <ORG> the appellant intended to set up a Hydrogenation plant for manufacture of <ORG> and sought for confirmation that this industrial unit which it proposed to set up would be entitled to sales tax holiday for a period of three years from the date it commenced production The appellant was also subsequently informed by the letter dated rd January of the th respondent categorically that the proposed <ORG> factory of the appellant will be entitled to exemption from Sales Tax for a period of three years from the date of going into production and that this will apply to all <ORG> sold during that period in Uttar Pradesh itself The appellant immediately by its letter dated th May pointed out to the th respondent that so far as the appellant was concerned <ORG> had already granted exemption from sales tax by the letter of the Chief Secretary dated rd January but still the appellant would be glad to send its representative to attend the meeting The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> asking for a writ directing <ORG> to exempt the sales of <ORG> manufactured by the appellant from Sales Tax for a period of three years commencing from nd January by issuing a notification under section A of the Sales Tax Act from the appellant for the said period of three years The view taken by <ORG> namely that even if there was an assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> and such assurance was binding on <ORG> on the principle of promissory estoppel the appellant had waived its right under it by a accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set out in the letter of the th respondent dated th January is not correct In the instant case a the plea of waiver was not taken by <ORG> in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to the writ petition nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit It was not right for <ORG> to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea should have been rejected in limine If waiver were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated th June and establishing that on those facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent A In the instant case on the facts the plea of waiver could not be said to have been made out by <ORG> There was nothing to state that at the date when the appellant addressed the letter dated th June it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right It is not possible to presume in the absence of any material placed before the <ORG> that the appellant had full knowledge of its right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing the letter dated th June The true principle of promissory estoppel is that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relationship effect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is infact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any pre existing relationship between the parties or not The doctrine would apply even where there is no pre existing legal relationship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship whish will arise in future It is an equitable principle evolved by the <ORG>s for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence and it should only be a shield and not a sword to found a cause of action There is no qualitative difference between proprietary estoppel and promissory estoppel Both are the off springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action there is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as cause of action if necessary to satisfy the equity Therefore despite the fact that allowing promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation this new principle which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should not be held in fetters but allowed to operate in all its activist magnitude A promise may in the United States derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor knowing or intending that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in English and <ORG> jurisprudence The <ORG> would not be estopped by the acts of its officers and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit and these dealing with an agent of the <ORG> must be held to have notice of limitations of his authority Where the <ORG> makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promisee and in fact the promisee acting in reliance on it alters his position the <ORG> would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the <ORG> at the instance of the promisee notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article of the Constitution The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because on the facts equity would not require that the <ORG> should be held bound by the promise made by it A When the <ORG> is able to show that in view of the facts as they have transpired public interest would be prejudiced if the <ORG> were required to carry out the promise the <ORG> would have to balance the public interest in the <ORG> carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the <ORG> and determine which way the equity lies It is only if the <ORG> is satisfied on proper and adequate material placed by the <ORG> that over riding public interest requires that the <ORG> should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it that the <ORG> would refuse to enforce the promise against the <ORG> In order to attract the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is not necessary that the promisee acting in reliance on the promise should suffer any deteriment a The letter dated rd January was a representation on behalf of the <ORG> the representation having been made by the th respondent in his capacity as the Chief Secretary of the <ORG> categorically to the effect that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of the sale of vanaspati effected in Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production This representation was made by way of clarification in view of the suggestion in the appellant letter dated nd January that the financial institutions were not prep ed to regard the earlier letter of the th respondent dated nd December as a definite commitment on the part of the <ORG> to grant exemption from sales tax A The representation made by the th respondent was a representation within the scope of his authority and was binding on the <ORG> in as much as the th respondent who was at the material time the Chief Secretary to the <ORG> and also Adviser to the Governor discharging the functions of the <ORG> during the President Rule had authority to bind the Governor Modi Rubber Ltd The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by certificate raises a question of considerable importance in the field of public law The law in regard to promissory estoppel is not yet well settled though it has been the subject of considerable debate in England as well as the United <ORG>s of America and it has also received consideration in some recent decisions in India and we therefore propose to discuss it in some detail with a view to defining its contours and demarcating its parameters We will first state briefly the facts giving rise to this appeal The appellant is a limited company which is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of sugar and it has also a cold storage plant and a steel foundry On th October a news item appeared in <ORG> in which it was stated that the State of Uttar Pradesh had decided to give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under section A of the Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the State with a view to enabling them to come on firm footing in developing stage The th respondent however stated categorically in his letter in reply dated rd January that the proposed <ORG> Factory of the appellant will be entitled to exemption from Sales Tax for a period of three years from the date of going into production and that this will apply to all <ORG> sold during that period in Uttar Pradesh itself and expressed his surprise that a letter from the Chief Secretary to <ORG> stating this fact in clear and unambiguous words should not carry conviction with the financial institutions The appellant by its letter dated th April advised the th respondent that <ORG> being convinced by the clear and categorical assurance given by the th respondent that the <ORG> Factory of the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production had sanctioned financial assistance to the appellant and the appellant was going ahead with the project in full speed to enable it to start production at the earliest The appellant immediately by its letter dated th May pointed out to the th respondent that so far as the appellant was concerned <ORG> had already granted exemption from Sales Tax by the letter of the Chief Secretary dated rd January but still the appellant would be glad to send its representative to attend the meeting as desired by the th respondent The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> asking for a writ directing <ORG> to exempt the sales of <ORG> manufactured by the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years commencing from nd July by issuing a notification under section A and not to collect or charge sales tax from the appellant for the said period of three years It appears that in the writ petition as originally filed there was no plea of promissory estoppel taken against <ORG> and the writ petition was therefore amended by obtaining leave of <ORG> with a view to introducing the plea of promissory estoppel The appellant urged in the amended writ petition that the th respondent acting on behalf of <ORG> had given an unequivocal assurance to the appellant that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production and this assurance was given by the th respondent intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant acting in reliance on it established the <ORG> factory by investing a large amount and <ORG> was therefore bound to honour the assurance and exempt the <ORG> manufactured and sold by the appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from nd July The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal after obtaining a certificate of fitness from <ORG> The principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the th respondent had given a categorical assurance on behalf of <ORG> that the appellant would be exempt from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production and such assurance was given intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant acting in reliance on it altered its position and <ORG> was therefore bound on the principle of promissory estoppel to honour the assurance and exempt the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years from nd July being the date on which the factory of the appellant commenced production The appellant urged that waiver was a question of fact which was required to be pleaded and since no plea of waiver was raised in the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> in opposition to the writ petition it was not competent to <ORG> to rely on the plea of waiver for the first time at the hearing of the writ petition Even if the plea of waiver were allowed to be raised notwithstanding that it did not find place in the pleadings no waiver was made out said the appellant since there was nothing to show that were the circumstances in which the appellant had addressed the letter dated th June stating that it would avail of the exemption granted under the letter dated th January and it was not possible to say that the appellant with full knowledge of its right to claim total exemption from payment of sales tax waived that right and agreed to accept the concessional rates set out in the letter dated th January <ORG> on the other hand strongly pressed the plea of waiver and submitted that the appellant had clearly waived its right to complete exemption from payment of Sales Tax by addressing the letter dated th June <ORG> also contended that in any event even if there was no waiver the appellant was not entitled to enforce the assurance given by the th respondent since such assurance was not binding on <ORG> and more over in the absence of notification under section A <ORG> could not be prevented from enforcing the liability to sales tax imposed on the appellant under the provisions of the Act It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that there could be no promissory estoppel against <ORG> so as to inhibit it from formulating and implementing its policies in public interest These were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to consider them We shall first deal with the question of waiver since that can be disposed of in a few words <ORG> held that even if there was an assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> and such assurance was binding on <ORG> on the principle of promissory estoppel the appellant had waived its right under it by accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set out in the letter of the th respondent dated th January Here it was common ground that the plea of waiver was not taken by <ORG> in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to the writ petition nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit If waiver were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated th June and establishing that on these facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent It was therefore not right for <ORG> to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea should have been rejected in limine Now in the present case there is nothing to show that at the date when the appellant addressed the letter dated th June it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right In fact in the petition as originally filed the right to claim total exemption from sales tax was not based on the plea of promissory estoppel which was introduced only by way of amendment Moreover it must be remembered that there is no presumption that every person knows the law It is often said that every one is presumed to know the law but that is not a correct statement there is no such maxim known to the law Over a hundred and thirty years ago <NAME> pointed out in <NAME> <NAME> There is no presumption in this country that every person knows the law it would be contrary to common sense and reason if it were so There is the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse a maxim of very different scope and application It is therefore not possible to presume in the absence of any material placed before the <ORG> that the appellant had full knowledge of its right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing the letter dated th June We accordingly reject the plea of waiver raised on behalf of <ORG> That takes us to the question whether the assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> that the appellant would be exempt from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production could be enforced against <ORG> by invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel It is interesting to trace the evolution of this doctrine in England and to refer to some of the English decisions in order to appreciate the true scope and ambit of the doctrine particularly because it has been the subject of considerable recent development and is steadily expanding Lord <NAME> stated the doctrine in its earliest form it has undergone considerable development since then in the following words in <NAME> <ORG> supra It is the first principle upon which all Courts of Equity proceed that if parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal results afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or held in abeyance the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties The claim was allowed because the court took the view that the period for which the full rent was claimed fell out side the representation but Mr Justice <NAME> as he then was considered <NAME> whether the plaintiffs could have recovered the covenanted rent for the whole period of the lease and observed that in equity the plaintiffs could not have been allowed to act inconsistently with their promise on which the defendants had acted It was pressed upon the <ORG> that according to the well settled law as laid down in Jorden Money no estoppel could be raised against plaintiffs since the doctrine of estoppel by representation is applicable only to representations as to some state of facts alleged to be at the time actually in existence and not to promises de futuro which if binding at all must be binding only as contracts and here there was no representa tion of an existing state of facts by the plaintiffs but it was merely a promise or representation of intention to act in a particular manner in the future Ten years later <ORG> also used the same terminology in <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> supra that If persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct those against whom they have such rights to believe In fact <NAME> <NAME> pointed out in <ORG> <ORG> Lord <NAME> in his enunciation of the principle assumed a pre existing contractual relationship between the parties but this does not seem to me to be essential provided that there is a pre existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties But even this limitation suggested by <NAME> <NAME> that there should be a pre existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties is not warranted and it is significant that the statement of the doctrine by Mr Justice <NAME> in the High Trees case does not contain any such limitation I do not think it is so limited see <ORG> <ORG> It applies whenever a representation is made whether of fact or law present or future which is intended to be binding intended to induce a person to act on it and he does act on it The doctrine would seem to apply even where there is no pre existing legal relationship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship which will arise in future The true principle of promissory estoppel therefore seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any preexisting relationship between the parties or not It may be pointed out that in England the law has been well settled for a long time though there is some indication of a contrary trend to be found in recent juristic thinking in that country that promissory estoppel cannot itself be the basis of an action The ghost of traditional estoppel continues to haunt this new doctrine and that is why we find that while boldly formulating and applying this new equity in the High Trees case Lord <NAME> added a qualification that though in the circumstances set out the promise would undoubtedly be held by the courts to be binding on the party making it notwithstanding that under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it the courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it It only prevents a party from insisting upon his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties So also said <NAME> in the more recent case of <NAME> <ORG> The doctrine may afford a defence against the enforcement or otherwise of enforceable rights it cannot create a cause of action It is an equitable principle evolved by the courts for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence It may be noted that even Lord <NAME> recognised in <NAME> Arun Distric Council supra that there are estoppels and estoppels Some don and added that in the species of estoppel called proprietary estoppel it does give rise to a cause of action The learned Law Lord after quoting what he had said in <ORG> Twitchings namely that the effect of estoppel on the true owner may be that his own title to the property be it land or goods has been held to be limited or extinguished and new rights and interests have been created therein But if we look at the judgments of Lord <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> it is apparent that they did not base their decision on any distinctive feature of proprietary estoppel but proceeded on the assumption that there was no distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel so far as the problem before them was concerned Lord <NAME> referring to what Lord <NAME> had said in <NAME> <ORG> a decision from which inspiration was drawn by him for evolving the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the High Tree case observed that it is the first principle on which all courts of equity proceed that it will prevent person from insisting on his strict legal rights whether arising under a contract or on his title deeds or by statute when it would be inequitable for him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties <NAME> <NAME> also observed that in pursuing the inquiry as to whether there was an equity in favour of <NAME> he did not find helpful the distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel He added that this distinction may indeed be valuable to those who have to teach or expound the law but I do not think that in solving the particular problem raised by a particular case putting the law into categories is of the slightest assistance The representative of <ORG> clearly gave assurance to <NAME> that they would give him access to the new road at point to serve the southern portion of his land and <ORG> in fact constructed a gate at point and in the belief induced by this representation that he would have right of access to the new road at point <NAME> agreed to sell the northern portion of his land without reserving for himself as owner of the southern portion any right of way over the northern portion for the purpose of access to the new road <ORG> was held bound by its promise to provide <NAME> access to the new road at point and this promise was enforced against <ORG> at the instance of <NAME> The case was one which fell within the category of promissory estoppel and it may be regarded as supporting the view that promissory estoppel can be the basis of a cause of action If proprietary estoppel can furnish a cause of action why should promissory estoppel not There is no qualitative difference between the two Both are the off springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action there is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as a cause of action if necessary to satisfy the equity The learned authors have also observed at page that to give a plaintiff a cause of action on a promissory estoppel must be little less than to allow an action in contract where consideration is not shown and that cannot be done because consideration still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract It can hardly be disputed that over the last three or four centuries the doctrine of consideration has come to occupy such a predominant position in the law of contract that under the English law it is impossible to think of a contract without consideration and therefore it is understandable that the English courts should have hesitated to push the doctrine of promissory estoppel to its logical conclusion and stopped short at allowing it to be used merely as a weapon of defence though as we shall point out there are quite a few cases where this doctrine has been used not as founding a cause of action in itself but as a part of a cause of a action For the effect of that doctrine in the present case is to make it possible for a person to snap his fingers at a bargain deliberately made a bargain not in itself unfair and which the person seeking to enforce it has a legitimate interest to enforce We do not see any valid reason why promissory estoppel should not be allowed to found a cause of action where in order to satisfy the equity it is necessary to do so It is true that to allow promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation but that is no reason why this new principle which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should be held in fetters and not allowed to operate in all the activist magnitude so that it may fulfil the purpose for which it was conceived and born There are many intermediate stages mores if inadequate to obliterate the past may fix direction for the future It is true that the Restatement has not the same weight as a source of law as actual decisions of courts of high standing yet the principle set out in Article has in fact formed the basis of a number of decisions in various states and it is now becoming increasingly clear that a promise may in the United States derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor intending that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in English and Commonwealth jurisprudence There is for instance the long line of cases in which a promise to give a charitable subscription has been consistently held to be enforceable at the suit of the charity We held the promise binding though consideration there was none except upon the theory of a promissory estoppel It is not possible to say that any detriment which the contractor may be able to show in these cases would amount to consideration in its strict sense and these decisions have plainly been reached on an application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel There are also numerous cases where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the Government where the interest of justice morality and common fairness clearly dictated such a course We shall refer to these cases when we discuss the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the Government Suffice it to state for the present that the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been taken much further in the United States than in English and Commonwealth jurisdictions and in some States at least it has been used to reduce if not to destroy the prestige of consideration as an essential of valid contract <NAME> in an early decision in <ORG> The King held that an undertaking given by <ORG> to certain neutral ship owners during the First World War that if the shipowners sent a particular ship to the United Kingdom with a specified cargo she shall not be detained was not enforceable against <ORG> in a court of law and observed that his main reason for taking this view was that it is not competent for the <ORG> to fetter its future executive action which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when the question arises It cannot by contract hamper its freedom of action in matters which concern the welfare of the <ORG> The courts in America for a long time took the view that the doctrine of promissory estoppel does not apply to the <ORG> but more recently the courts have started retreating from that position to a sounder one namely that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may apply to the <ORG> when justice so requires Since there is an increasing trend towards applying the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the <ORG> and the old law that promissory estoppel does not apply against the government is definitely declining There were at this time wheat crop insurance regulations framed by the <ORG> and published in <ORG> which prohibited insurance of spring wheat reseeded on winter wheat acreage but neither the respondents nor <ORG>s which was acting as the agent of the <ORG> was aware of them A few months later most of the respondent crop was destroyed by drought and on a claim being made by the respondents under the policy of insurance the <ORG> refused to pay the loss on the ground that the wheat crop insurance regulations expressly prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat There has so far not been any decision of <ORG> of the United <ORG>s taking the view that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked against the <ORG> Of course as pointed out by the United <ORG>s Court of Appeals <ORG> in <NAME> United <ORG>s the <ORG> would not be estopped by the acts of its officers and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit and those dealing with an agent of the <ORG> must be held to have notice of limitations of his authority as held in <NAME> case This is precisely what <ORG> also held in England in <NAME> <ORG> supra where Lord <NAME> stated the law to be The illegality of an act is the same whether or not the actor has been misled by an assumption of authority on the part of a <ORG> officer however high or low in the hierachy This defence was upheld by <ORG> of <ORG> and <NAME> speaking on behalf of <ORG> pointed out that in view of the following facts namely the <ORG> gave up the old stables levelled the ground and erected the moveable staibles in in the belief that they had against the Government an absolute right not to be turned out until not only the expiration of six months notice but also other suitable ground was furnished that this belief is referable to an expectation created by the Government that their enjoyment of the land would be in accordance with this belief and that the Government knew that the <ORG> were acting in this belief so created an equity was created in favour of the Municipality which entitled it to appeal to the Court for its aid in assisting them to resist the Secretary of State claim that they shall be ejected from the ground The facts giving rise to this case were that in <ORG> called upon the predecessor in title of <ORG> to remove old markets from a certain site and vacate it and on the application of the Municipal Commissioner the <ORG> passed a resolution approving and authorizing the grant of another site to the Municipality <ORG> held that the <ORG> had lost its right to assess the land in question by reason of the equity arising on the facts of the case in favour of <ORG> and there was thus a limitation on the right of the <ORG> to assess under section of the Bom bay City Land Revenue Act On appeal by the Collector to this Court the majority Judges held that the <ORG> was not under the circumstances of the case entitled to assess land revenue on the land in question because <ORG> had taken possession of the land in terms of the <ORG> resolution and had continued in such possession openly uninterruptedly and of right for over seventy years and thereby acquired the limited title it had been prescribing for during the period that is to say the right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent We may briefly state the facts in order to appreciate the ratio of the decision The respondents contended that relying on the promise contained in the Scheme they had exported woollen goods to Afghanistan and were We have already referred to these observations earlier and we need not reproduce them over again Under our constitutional set up no person may be deprived of his right or liberty except in due course of and by authority of law of a member of the <ORG> seeks to deprive a citizen of his right or liberty otherwise than in exercise of power derived from the law common or statute the <ORG> will be competent to and indeed would be bound to protect the rights of the aggrieved citizen It was also contended on behalf of the Government that if the Government were held bound by every representation made by it regarding its intention when the exporters have acted in the manner they were invited to act the result would be that the Government would be bound by a contractual obligation even though no formal contract in the manner required by Article was executed But this contention was negatived and it was pointed out by this Court that the respondents are not seeking to enforce any contractual right they are seeking to enforce compliance with the obligation which is laid upon the Textile Commissioner by the terms of the Scheme and we are of the view that even if the Scheme is executive in character the respondents who were aggrieved because of the failure to carry out the terms of the Scheme were entitled to seek resort to the Court and claim that the obligation imposed upon the Textile Commissioner by the Scheme be ordered to be carried out supra summed up the position as follows Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it nor claim to be the Judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation has arisen The law may therefore now be taken to be settled as a result of this decision that where the <ORG> makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promises and in fact the promisee acting in reliance on it alters his position the <ORG> would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the <ORG> at the instance of the promises notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article of the Constitution Can the <ORG> say that it is under no obligation to act in a manner that is fair and just or that it is not bound by considerations of honesty and good faith Why should the <ORG> not be held to a high standard of rectangular rectitude while dealing with its citizens There was a time when the doctrine of executive necessity was regarded as sufficient justification for the <ORG> to repudiate even its contractual obligations but let it be said to the eternal glory of this Court this doctrine was emphatically negatived in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and the supremacy of the rule of law was established But if the <ORG> makes such a promise and the promises acts in reliance upon it and alters his position there is no reason why the <ORG> should not be compelled to make good such promise like any other private individual The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because on the facts equity would not require that the <ORG> should be held bound by the promise made by it When the <ORG> is able to show that in view of the facts as have transpired public interest would be prejudiced if the <ORG> were required to carry out the promise the <ORG> would have to balance the public interest in the <ORG> carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and after this position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the <ORG> and determine which way the equity lies If the <ORG> wants to resist the liability it will have to disclose to the <ORG> what are the facts and circumstances on account of which the <ORG> claims to be exempt from the liability and it would be for the <ORG> to decide whether these facts and circumstances are such as to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the <ORG> It is only if the <ORG> is satisfied on proper and adequate material placed by the <ORG> the over riding public interest requires that the <ORG> should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it that the <ORG> would refuse to enforce the promise against the <ORG> The question which arose in this case was whether <ORG> could be compelled to carry out a promise made by its predecessor municipality that the factories in the industrial area within its jurisdiction would be exempt from payment of octroi for seven years from the date of the levy The High <ORG> dismissed the petition in limine but on appeal this <ORG> took the view that this was a case which required consideration and should have been admitted by the High <ORG> The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contracted by a person who acts upon the promise when the law requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain from or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute the obligation may be if the contract be not in that form be enforced against it in appropriate cases in equity The learned Judge then referred to the decision in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and observed that in that case it was laid down by this <ORG> that the <ORG> is not exempt from the equity arising out of the acts done by citizens to their prejudice relying upon the representations as to its future conduct made by the <ORG> The learned Judge after referring to the decisions in <ORG> case <NAME> Minister of Pensions supra and the Indo Afghan Agencies case pointed out that the rule laid down in these decisions undoubtedly advanced the cause of justice and hence we have no hesitation in accepting it The appellant challenged the validity of termination of service inter alia on the ground that the <ORG> was precluded from abolishing the post and terminating the service on the principle of promissory estoppel In the first place this observation was clearly obiter since as pointed out by us there was on the facts of the present case no scope for the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel Secondly this observation was based upon a quotation from the passage in paragraph at page of Volume of American Jurisprudence but unfortunately this quotation was incomplete and it overlooked perhaps inadvertently the following two important sentences at the commencement of the paragraph which clearly show that even in the United <ORG>s the doctrine of promissory estoppel is applied against the <ORG> when justified by the facts There is considerable dispute as to the application of estoppel with respect to the <ORG> Even the truncated passage quoted by the <ORG> recognised in the last sentence that though as a general rule the doctrine of promissory estoppel would not be applied against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity the <ORG> would unhesitatingly allow the doctrine to be invoked in cases where it is necessary in order to prevent fraud or manifest injustice This proposition is unexceptionable because where the <ORG> owes a duty to the public to act in a particular manner and here obviously duty means a course of conduct enjoined by law the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing the <ORG> from acting in discharge of its duty under the law It is true that in this case the Court expressed the opinion that the view taken by <ORG> is the correct one and not the one taken by Lord <NAME> but we fail to see how that can possibly help the argument of the <ORG> This was also a decision on which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the <ORG> In the first place it is clear that in this case there was factually no foundation for invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel When the <ORG> auctioned the licence for retail sale of country liquor and the respondents being the highest bidders were granted such licence there was in force a Notification dated th April issued under section of the Sales Tax Act exempting sale of country liquor from payment of sales tax However on the day following the commencement of the licence granted to the respondents the <ORG> of issued a Notification dated nd April superseding the earlier Notification dated th April and imposing sales tax on the turnover in respect of country spirit with immediate effect Now it is clear that even taking the case of the respondents at its highest there was no representation or promise made by the <ORG> that they would continue the exemp tion from sales tax granted under the Notification dated th April and would not withdraw it and the Notification dated nd April could not therefore be assailed as being in breach of any such representation or promise There was accordingly no factual basis for making good the plea of promissory estoppel and the observation made by the court in regard to the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the <ORG> was clear obiter The <ORG> first relied on the statement of the law contained in paragraph at page Volume of the American Jurisprudence but it omitted to mention the two important sentences at the commencement of the paragraph and the words unless its application is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice at the end which clearly show that even according to the American Jurisprudence the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not wholly inapplicable against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity but it can be invoked against the <ORG> when justified by the facts as for example where it is necessary to prevent fraud or injustice In fact as already pointed out above there are numerous cases in the United States where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the <ORG> in the exercise of its governmental public or executive powers The <ORG> then relied upon the decision in <ORG> case but that decision was confined to a case where legislation was sought to be precluded by relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and it was held and in our opinion rightly that there can be no promissory estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its legislative function The last decision on which the <ORG> relied was <ORG> <NAME> supra but this decision also does not support the view contended for on behalf of the State We have already referred to this decision earlier and pointed out that the <ORG> in this case was held not liable on the policy of insurance because the regulations made by the <ORG> prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat It was held in this case in paragraph of the judgment that the respondent could not invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel because he was unable to show that relying on the representation of the Govern ment he had altered his position by investing moneys and the allegations made by him in that behalf were much too vague and general and there was accordingly no factual foundation for establishing the plea of promissory estoppel There is therefore nothing in this decision which should compel us to take a view different from the one we are otherwise inclined to accept this Court approved of the decisions in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and <ORG> case and pointed out that these were cases where it could be held that public bodies or the <ORG> are as much bound as private individuals are to carry out obligations incurred by them because parties seeking to bind the authorities have altered their position to their disadvantage or have acted to their detriment on the strength of the representations made by these authorities It would therefore be seen that there is no authoritative decision of <ORG> which has departed from the law laid down in the celebrated decisions in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and <ORG> case It is clear from the letter of the th respondent dated rd January that a categorical representation was made by the th respondent on behalf of the <ORG> that the proposed vanaspati factory of the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected in Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production This representation was made by way of clarification in view of the suggestion in the appellant letter dated nd January that the financial institutions were not prepared to regard the earlier letter of the th respondent dated nd December as a definite commitment on the part of the <ORG> to grant exemption from sales tax It was faintly contended before us on behalf of the <ORG> that this representation was not binding on the <ORG> but we cannot countenance this argument because in the first place the averment in the writ petition that the th respondent made this representation on behalf of the government was not denied by the <ORG> in the affidavit in reply filed on its behalf and secondly it is difficult to accept the contention that the th respondent who was at the material time the Chief Secretary to the government and also advisor to the Governor who was discharging the functions of the <ORG> We must therefore proceed on the basis that this representation made by the th respondent was a representation within the scope of his authority and was binding on the <ORG> The <ORG> however contended that the doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application in the present case because the appellant did not suffer any detriment by acting on the representation made by the <ORG> the vanaspati factory set up by the appellant was quite a profitable concern and there was no prejudice caused to the appellant We do not think it is necessary in order to attract the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel that the promisee acting in reliance of the promise should suffer any detriment There is in fact not a single case in England where detriment is insisted upon as a necessary ingredient of promissory estoppel Of course it may be pointed out that if the Sales Tax Act did not contain a provision enabling the <ORG> to grant exemption it would not be possible to enforce the representation against the <ORG> because the <ORG> cannot be compelled to act contrary to the statute but since section of the Sales Tax Act confers power on the <ORG> to grant exemption from sales tax the <ORG> can legitimately be held bound by its promise to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax It appears that surcharge amounting to Rs If no such claim is made or if made not adjudicated upon within the time specified the <ORG> will refund the amount of sales tax to the appellant with interest thereon at the rate of per annum from the date when such refund becomes due and if such claim is made and adjudicated upon within the specified time and it is found that a part of this amount is liable to be retained by the <ORG> under some provision of law the <ORG> will refund the balance to the appellant with interest at the like rate So far as the assessment years and are concerned <ORG> will proceed to complete the Assessments for those assessment years in the light of the law laid down in this judgment and the amounts of sales tax deposited by the appellant will be refunded to the appellant to the extent to which they are not found due and payable as a result of the assessments subject to any claim which the <ORG> may have to retain those amounts under any provision of law We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and issue a writ order or direction to the above effect against the respondents
