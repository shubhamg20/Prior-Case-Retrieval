No Whereas the Governor of Bihar is satisfied with respect to the person known as Shree Brajnandan Sharma son of Shree Ayodhya Prasad Sharma of village Dabaul Hilsa district Patna at present Jamadova Jorapokhary Dhanbad that with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of the public order it is necessary to make the following order Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by Clause of Sub section of Section Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act Bihar Act III of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to direct that the said <NAME> shall not with effect from the date of service on him of this order be in any place in the district of Singhbhum and Manbhum His contention is however that on the Constitution coming into force the restrictive provisions in Act III of and also the order passed thereunder became void under Article of the Constitution read with Articles and All citizens shall have the right to move freely throughout the territory of India Article is in these terms Nothing in Sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe It is contended that the provision for restricting an individual movements contained in Section of the Act is not reasonable because it provides for orders not on reasonable grounds but on the satisfaction of <ORG> which may be reasonable or unreasonable Secondly Mr <NAME> contends that whatever may be said about the Act there were in any case no reasonable grounds for this order The clause speaks of any existing law in so far as it imposes reasonable restrictions and the making of a law imposing reasonable restrictions It is apparent on the face of it that the provision does represent an interference with the fundamental right guaranteed by Article Therefore there is no escape from the position that under Article this provision became void on th January unless it is saved by Article Clause Daring the existence of a state of emergency it might be saved under Article But there has been no proclamation of an emergency and Article has no application to the present case Where a police officer made an arrest under this provision <ORG> held that the burden was on him to prove to the satisfaction of the <ORG> before whom the arrest was challenged that he had reasonable grounds of suspicion There has been a prima facie infringement of that right and prima facie no law can infringe that right Turning now to the question of fact whether the impugned provision imposes only reasonable restrictions the answer must If the law enables orders to be passed which are unreasonable and yet are consistent with its terms then that cannot be called a law operating to impose only reasonable restrictions I use the word only advisedly because it appears to me that if the law enables unreasonable action in any case then it cannot be saved by Article That rule runs as follows Any <ORG> <ORG> or authority requited or empowered to enforce any law in force in the territory of India immediately before the appointed day shall notwithstanding that this order makes no provision or Insufficient provision for the adaptation of the law or the purpose of bringing it into accord with the provisions of the Constitution construe the law with all such adaptations as are necessary for the said purpose Provided that if any question arises regarding the adaptations with which such law should be construed for the said purpose the question shall be referred to <ORG> if the law relates to a matter enumerated in List I or List III In Schedule to the Constitution and to the State Government concerned in any other case and the decision of that Government on any such reference shall be final It is enough to say that I agree entirely with the observations on this point made by the Calcutta case no This rule purports to delegate legislative power to the <ORG> We must take the Act as we find it I hold accordingly that Section of the Act became void on bh January and it necessarily follows that the order made under that provision became void I think Article when it says that <ORG> shall have power to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari or any of them for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose means more than this and gives us full authority and indeed a duty to issue necessary directions <NAME> The fundamental rights in the exercise of which the petitioner has been restricted are the rights given to all citizens by Clause of Article namely the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the right given by Clause namely the right to reside <ORG> recognized this and in enacting Clauses to of Article endeavoured to define the limits subject to which the <ORG> might impose statutory restrictions on the exercise by citizens of their fundamental rights The question that arises here is whether or not the Bihar <ORG> hag exceeded the limits imposed on it by the Constitution Clause of Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to exclude either absolutely or subject to certain conditions an individual from any area or place These is brief are the restrictions imposed by the Act on the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom of movement It seems to me impossible to say that in no circumstances can it be necessary to exclude particular individuals from areas or places in which the public safety and the maintenance of public order has been or is likely to be endangered Also it seems to me impossible to say that the extent to which the fundamental rights of such an individual have been interfered with is an unreasonable extent Mr <NAME> for the petitioner has not contended that it may not be necessary in certain circumstances to impose restrictions of this kind on the exercise by individuals of their fundamental rights to move freely and to reside in any part of the territory of India <ORG> conferred on the executive a power of a much more extensive kind namely a power to deprive a citizen temporarily of his liberty In other words the validity of the Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act is challenged not on the ground that the restrictions which it imposes are not reasonable restrictions nor on the ground that these restrictions have not been imposed in the interest of the general public but on the ground that the law is an unreasonable law The word reasonable which now appears in Clauses to of Article of the Constitution is not to be found in the Draft Constitution Under the Draft Constitution it was left to the legislature and to the legislature alone to decide whether any restrictions which the Ministry of the day sought to impose were reasonable restrictions and as such ought to be imposed The result of inserting it clearly is that the judiciary is now empowered to review certain decisions of the legislature decisions taken quite possibly after a very full deliberation and with a knowledge of local conditions which the judiciary does not and cannot possess There must be numerous statutes and statutory orders which in one way or another impose restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights and I hesitate to subscribe to the proposition that it is now open to the judiciary to examine these statutes and statutory orders in detail and pronounce any of them to be void on the ground that they do not contain provisions which in the opinion of the judiciary they ought to have contained What is the criterion to be adopted by the <ORG> in deciding whether legislation of this kind is or is not valid legislation What is the question to which the <ORG> are bound to address themselves The answer given by the Constitution is that the question is this Are the restrictions which have been or can be imposed reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public That it seems to me is equivalent to saying Are the restrictions reasonably necessary in the interests of the general public or to depart still further from the language used in the Constitution Is the extent to which the rights of individuals are or are liable to be interfered with no more than is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public If that is the criterion to be adopted then it is I think immaterial that there may be ancillary provisions in the statute which may lead to hardship in individual cases Thirdly and this is a circumstance which weighs a great deal with me when the validity of a law which has been duly passed after full discussion by both Chambers of the legislature and hag received the assent of the President is challenged the onus is and is very heavily on the person who challenges it to show that it is an unconstitutional law I have had the advantage of reading the judgment which has just been delivered by my Lord the Chief Justice and the judgment which is about to be delivered by my brother <NAME> and as the view which both of them take is diametrically opposed to my own I have studied them with the care and attention which they deserve Reverting to the point again at a later stage in his judgment <NAME> observes I would give to the word reasonable occurring in Clause of Article the full significance of its accepted connotations The word reasonable may have been used in the sense in which <NAME> now construes it in certain enactments in England but where so used it has invariably qualified some such word as cause or belief or suspicion If ever there was a case in which it was not permissible and was in the highest degree dangerous to depart from the accepted canons of construction it is this case And the result in this case of putting what appears to me to be a highly unnatural and artificial meaning on the word reasonable is that a law duly enacted by the legislature of Bihar is pronounced to be void and the executive is deprived of a weapon which if used in the manner in which it is intended to be used may be of great benefit to the community and productive of comparatively little harm to individuals It is beyond the power of the Hon ble the Chief Minister to establish by evidence in a Court of law what the state of his mind was when he made the order The constable if called to answer in a Court of law must show that he had reason to suspect that the man had a stick of dynamite in his pocket But the right to personal liberty and the right to move freely from one place to another are rights of a somewhat different character and are in fact dealt with in separate and distinct articles of the Constitution It is true that the orders were made in exercise of powers conferred by emergency legislation It can make no difference that the question at issue is not whether <ORG> has trespassed into a field of legislative activity reserved for the centre but whether it hag trespassed into a field in which neither it nor <ORG> itself has any legislative jurisdiction at all The framers of the Constitution in express words themselves conferred on the executive power to deprive a man of his personal liberty and I cannot be persuaded that they intended that the power of <ORG> to authorize the executive to place restrictions on the exercise by individual citizens of fundamental rights for less vital to them than their right to personal liberty should be so circumscribed a power as my learned brothers would have it to be I would accordingly dismiss the application I have reached the same conclusion as my Lord <NAME> that Section Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act Bihar Act III of in so far as it operates to restrict freedom of movement of a free Citizen became void by reason of Article read with Article of the Constitution of India which came into force on th January I think that I should state briefly my reasons for reaching the same conclusion avoiding at the same time a repetition of the reasons already stated by my Lord <NAME> Section Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act is in the following terms The Provincial Government if satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of public order it is necessary so to do make an order directing that except in so far as he may be permitted by the provisions of the order or by such authority or persons as may be specified therein be shall not be in any such area or plane in the Province of Bihar as may be specified in the order Article of the Constitution of India so far as is relevant to this case states All citizens shall have the right to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India Sub clause of Article of the Constitution guarantees to all citizens of India the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and Sub clause gives the right to reside and settle in any part of India Section of the Bihar Act authorises the issue of an order imposing restrictions on such free movement or on the right of residence in any area or place in the State of Bihar on the satisfaction of the Provincial Government that is <ORG> This inconsistency at once attracts the operation of Article of the Constitution and the Bihar Act is rendered void to the extent of the inconsistency under the said article there is however Clause of Article of the Constitution which amongst other things saves the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by Sub clause and Sub clause Clause of Article is in the following terms Nothing in Sub clause and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in as far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe I do not think that there is any doubt that it is for this <ORG> to consider and decide whether the operation of Section of the Bihar Act is or is not saved by Clause of Article of the Constitution The rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are justiciable rights for the enforcement of which there are remedies including the remedy guaranteed by Article Article of the Constitution also provides a remedy and gives this <ORG> power to issue directions orders or writs to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III the language used by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> case A ALL the objective test merely means an external standard to be applied by some one other than the authority imposing the restriction namely by a judge whereas the subjective test excludes an external yardstick and means the decision of the person who acts may be reasonably but still it is his decision and not the decision of any one else The position therefore reduces itself to this under Clause of Article this <ORG> is to determine whether the relevant provisions of the Bihar Act impose or operate to impose reasonable restrictions on the right of free movement or residence of a citizen but the relevant provisions of the Bihar Act make it quite clear that the only prerequisite for such imposition is that <ORG> which will mean the Governor under the General Clauses Act though under the rules of Executive Business the matter may be dealt with by some other person may be the Chief Minister as is stated by the learned Advocate General in this case is satisfied that a restriction should be imposed on the free movement or residence of a citizen To hold otherwise would mean that the right of free movement or residence guaranteed by Article can be taken away by any law irrespective of the consideration whether that law imposes or operates to impose reasonable restrictions or not It has been contended by the learned Advocate General that reasonableness expediency public policy are matters for the <ORG> and not for the <ORG> That is so where no constitutional limitation is imposed on the power of legislation It is pointed out that the adjective reasonable qualifies restrictions therefore so the argument proceeds the <ORG> should not go into the question as to which authority imposes the restrictions which authority is to be satisfied etc I do not accept however the argument that only the territorial or external extent of the restrictions imposed need be considered under Clause of Article If the <ORG> is to consider the nature of the restrictions for determining whether they are reasonable or not the question at once arises whether the law operating to impose the restrictions allows a <ORG> to consider their reasonableness But the test is not the operation of a particular order passed against a particular person the test is what does the law imposing or operating to impose the restrictions authorise If that law says that no other pre requisite is necessary except the satisfaction of one person however perfect that person may be then the teat of reasonableness as applied by <ORG>s is taken away and the law to that extent ceases to be a law imposing or operating to impose reasonable restrictions within the meaning of Clause of Article of the Constitution In other words the law which imposes or operates to impose restrictions on the free movement or residence of a citizen must not exclude an external test of reasonableness if it does that law is not saved by Clause of Article It is to be observed that Clause of Article of the Constitution refers not merely to the operation of an existing law but also to the making of any law in future by the <ORG> under which restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of the right conferred by Sub clauses and of Article of the Constitution If the view for which the learned Advocate General contends is accepted as correct it would mean that the <ORG> can make a law imposing restrictions on the fundamental right of free movement and residence laying down in that law that the only prerequisite for the imposition of the restrictions is the satisfaction of the <ORG> and the person whose freedom is restricted will have no remedy to get the curtailment or abridgment of his right tested on the touchstone of reasonableness by a Court of law I am unable to subscribe to the view that Clause of Article was intended to make the right given by Article so illusory I would give to the word reasonable occurring in Clause of Article the full significance of its accepted connotation It is to be observed that there are other Articles where the test of reasonableness has not been incorporated see Article which is in similar terms but without the word reasonable There has been some argument before us on the footing that if the test of reasonableness does not enter into a law made for preventive detention under Article a fortiori that test should not enter into the lesser matter of a restriction on free movement or residence The learned Advocate General referred us to a large number of decisions on the question that this <ORG> cannot sit in appeal over the <ORG> and that the reasonableness of a particular piece of legislation is not for the <ORG>s to determine All those decisions relate to legislation on which there is no constitutional limitation and I do not think that any useful purpose will be served by examining those decisions in detail In view of the very wide terms of that Article I think that the petitioner is entitled to ask us for an order against <ORG> prohibiting that Government from enforcing the order which must be declared to be void after th January In conclusion I must make it clear that this decision must not be understood in the sense that the <ORG> cannot make any law imposing or operating to impose restrictions on freedom of movement of a citizen The <ORG> can do so and in so doing may authorise any person or even the <ORG> to take action but the law imposing or operating to impose such restrictions must fulfil the test of Clause of Article viz
