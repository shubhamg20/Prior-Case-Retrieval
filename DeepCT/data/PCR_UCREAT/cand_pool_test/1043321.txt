On there was exchange of hot words over the release of a sheep The trial court placing reliance on evidence of PW PW and PW came to hold that the accused was responsible for the death of the deceased The accepted prosecution version being that the assaults were made in course of a sudden quarrel Section has no application In view of the categorical evidence of PW PW and PW implicating the accused we find no reason to accept the plea of the accused about his innocence The plea relating to exercise of right of private defence has been rightly rejected by the courts below Section IPC provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence The Section does not define the expression right of private defence It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right Whether in a particular set of circumstances a person acted in the exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstance of each case No test in the abstract for determining such a question can be laid down In determining this question of fact the <ORG> must consider all the surrounding circumstances It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self defence In a given case the <ORG> can consider it even if the accused has not taken it if the same is available to be considered from the material on record The <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances It is for the accused to place necessary material on record either by himself adducing positive evidence or by eliciting necessary facts from the witnesses examined for the prosecution An accused taking the plea of the right of private defence is not required to call evidence he can establish his plea by reference to circumstances transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself The question in such a case would be a question of assessing the true effect of the prosecution evidence and not a question of the accused discharging any burden Where the right of private defence is pleaded the defence must be a reasonable and probable version satisfying the <ORG> that the harm caused by the accused was necessary for either warding off the attack or for forestalling any further reasonable apprehension from the attacker The burden of establishing the plea of self defence is on the accused and the burden stand discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record Sections and define the extent of the right of private defence of body If a person has a right of private defence of body under Section that right extends under Section to causing death if there is reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the assault AIR SC runs as follows It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self defence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that while the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt the accused need not establish the plea to the nilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying basis for that plea in the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence evidence The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence beyond reasonable doubt Non explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of occurrence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance This principle applies to cases where the injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and credit worthy that it far outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries A plea of right of private defence cannot be based on surmises and speculation While considering whether the right of private defence is available to an accused it is not relevant whether he may have a chance to inflict severe and mortal injury on the aggressor In order to find whether the right of private defence is available to an accused the entire incident must be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting Section deals with the subject matter of right of private defence The plea of right comprises the body or property i of the person exercising the right or ii of any other person and the right may be exercised in the case of any offence against the body and in the case of offences of theft robbery mischief or criminal trespass and attempts at such offences in relation to property Section lays down the limits of the right of private defence Sections and give a right of private defence against certain offences and acts The right given under Sections to and to is controlled by Section To claim a right of private defence extending to voluntary causing of death the accused must show that there were circumstances giving rise to reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused to him The burden is on the accused to show that he had right of private defence which extended to causing of death Sections and IPC define the limit and extent of right of private defence Sections and IPC deal with commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of body and property respectively The right commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat or commit the offence although the offence may not have been committed but not until that there is that reasonable apprehension In order to find whether right of private defence is available or not the injuries received by the accused the imminence of threat to his safety the injuries caused by the accused and the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be considered The appropriate conviction would therefore be under Section Part I IPC and custodial sentence of years would meet the ends of justice The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated
