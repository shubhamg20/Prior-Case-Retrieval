That Court took the view contended for by the respondent viz that only the proportionate amount of depreciation which was attributable to the taxable income could be taken into account The <ORG> appealed to this Court It was urged on behalf of the appellant that depreciation was allowed in respect of the use of the assets in the business that the allowance did not depend on the assessable income and that <ORG> therefore went wrong in striking a proportion on the basis of a part of the income actually assessed under the Indian Income tax Act The expression actually allowed in the main paragraph allowed in the proviso and taken into account in the Explanation mean the same thing What the Income tax Officer has to take into consideration in computing the written down value is the depreciation actually allowed under the Income tax Act or the laws obtaining in Part States and adopt the greater of the two sums so allowed under that head iii Under the Income tax Act depreciation allowance is in respect of such assets as are used in the business and shall be calculated on the written down value which means in the case of assets acquired in the previous year the actual cost to the assessee and in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under the Act The assessee was only assessed during the said years in respect of that part of its profits which could be said to be attributable to the sale proceeds or goods received in British India or in regard to which contract were signed in British India Such income was brought to tax in terms of of the Indian Income tax Rules The method adopted was that the amount of income for the purpose of Indian Income tax was calculated on an amount which bore the same proportion to the total profits of the business as the receipts accruing or arising in India bore to the total receipts of the business A The fact that income was computed under made no difference In the ascertainment of total profits either for the purposes of assessment in the ordinary manner when the income of the assessee is determined or when a fraction is to be adopted for the purpose of the second method contemplated by there is no scope for assuming that only a fraction of the depreciation is actually allowed There is therefore no warrant either in vi or in paragraph of the Removal of Difficulties Order or in framed under the Indian Income tax Act for the view that the depreciation allowed is a fraction of the total depreciation of the business <NAME> These appeals raise the question of construc tion of the provisions of the Taxation Laws Part States Removal of Difficulties Order hereinafter called the Order in the matter of computation of the aggregate depreciation allowances for the purpose of assessment to tax For those years in which it was assessed as a non resident under the Indian Income tax Act only that part of its profits which could be said to be attributable to the sale proceeds of goods received in British India or in regard to which contracts were accepted in British India was brought to tax After the merger of the <ORG> in <ORG> in order to rationalize the tax structure <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred on it under of the Finance Act issued the Order where under in the case of such disparity the greater of the two sums allowable was directed to be adopted On question <ORG> held that the depreciation allowed for the years up to and including in the I He argued that depreciation was allowed in respect of the user of the assets in the business Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the assessee contended that no depreciation as such having been allowed for the years upto and including as computed under the Indian Income tax Act the original cost itself should be taken as the written down value of the assets We shall deal with questions and together as as we have indicated earlier they are really parts of the same question In making any assessment under the Indian In come tax Act all depreciation actually allowed under any laws or rules of a Part State relating to income tax and super tax or any law relating to tax on profits of business shall be taken into account in computing the aggregate depreciation allowance refer red to in sub clause of the proviso to clause vi of sub section and the written down value under clause of sub section of section of the said Act Provided that where in respect of any asset depreciation has been allowed for any year both in the assessment made in the Part State and in the taxable territories the greater of the two sums allowed shall only be taken into account The proviso thereto says that when there is a conflict between the two rates the greater of the two sums allowed shall be taken into account It is true that decided cases have given a very wide meaning to the word assessment The expression actually allowed in the main paragraph allowed in the proviso and taken into account in the Explanation mean the same thing What the Income tax Officer has to take into consideration in computing the written down value is the depreciation actually allowed under the Income tax Act or the laws obtaining in Part States and adopt the greater of the two sums so allowed under that head Under of the Indian Income tax Act profits or gains of business shall be computed after making the allowances enumerated therein Under writtendown value means in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less the depreciation actually allowed to him under the Act Depreciation allowance is in respect of such assets as are used in the business and shall be calculated on the written down value which means in the case of assets acquired in the previous year the actual cost to the assessee and in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under the Act The assessee was only assessed during the said years in respect of that part of its profits which could be said to be attributable to the sale proceeds or goods received in British India or in regard to which contracts were accepted in British India Such income was brought to tax in terms of of the Indian Income tax Rules Under the said rule if the actual amount of the income profits or gains accruing or arising to a non resident cannot be ascertained the amount of such income profits or gains for the purposes of assessment to income tax may be calculated on such percentage of the turnover so accruing or arising as the Income tax Officer may consider to be reasonable or on an amount which bears the same proportion to the total profits of the business of such person such profits being computed in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act as the receipts so accruing or arising bear to the total receipts of the business or in such other manner as the Income tax Officer may deem suitable But under the third method which was adopted in the present case the amount of such income for the purpose of income tax shall be calculated on an amount which bears the same proportion to the total profits of the business of such person as the receipts so accruing or arising bears to the total receipts of the business But the learned counsel for the <ORG> contended that the entire depreciation of the assets was taken into consideration in computing the taxable income and therefore the entire amount should have been taken into account by the Income tax Officer in arriving at the written down value of the assets Learned counsel for the assessee contended that under the method adopted in terms of of the Income tax Rules no depreciation was allowed at all in ascertaining the taxable income in India for that was only taken into consideration in arriving at the total world income We cannot accept this argument we may say that the learned counsel did not press this point seriously either We do not propose to express any opinion on the question whether if the other methods suggested in of the Rules were adopted it could be held that no depreciation was actually allowed in making the assessment lm Whether the computation of the written down value of the assets of the applicant in the light of the provisions of Taxation Laws Part States Removal of Difficulties Order is legal and valid Whether the depreciation actually allowed means the depreciation deducted in arriving at the taxable income or in arriving at the world income <ORG> recorded on the first question the answer that depreciation allowed in the years up to and inclusive of the year in the assessment made in the taxable territories would be the Under the Indore Industrial Tax Rules depreciation was allowed at certain rates in respect of buildings plant and machinery By vi of the Indian Income tax Act in computing profits or gains of a business depreciation allowable in respect of buildings machinery plant and furniture used for the purpose of business being the property of the assessee is a sum equivalent to such percentage on the original cost thereof to the assessee as may in any case or class of cases be prescribed and in any By virtue of A a company is regarded as resident in the taxable territories in any year i if the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in the taxable territories in that year or ii if its income arising in the taxable territories I in that year exceeds its income arising without the taxable territories in that year Paragraph of that Order as originally promulgated read as follows In making any assessment under the Indian Income tax Act all depreciation actually allowed under any laws or rules of a Part State relating to income tax and super tax or any law relating to tax on profits of business shall be taken into account in computing the aggregate depreciation allowance referred to in sub clause of the proviso to clause vi of sub section and the written down value under clause of sub section of section of the said Act Provided that where in respect of any asset depreciation has been allowed for any year both in the assessment made in the Part State and in the taxable territories the greater of the two sums allowed shalt only be taken into account Therefore if before the application of the Income tax Act an assessee in a Part State was being assessed to tax only under a State law depreciation actually allowed had to be taken into account for ascertaining the written down value of buildings plant and machinery in the assessment year if he was assessed under the Indian Income tax Act as well as the State law in determining the appropriate written down value the proviso to paragraph had to be applied and depreciation actually allowed under the State law had to be compared with the depreciation actually allowed under the Indian Income tax Act The normal scheme of depreciation under the income tax Act is that depreciation progressively decreases every year being a percentage of the written down value which in the first year is the actual cost to the I assessee and in the years following the actual cost less all depreciation allowed under the Income tax Act or any Act repealed thereby see In determining the written down value of the buildings plant and machinery of the <ORG> <ORG> held that the expression actually allowed in paragraph means depreciation which is availed of for the purpose of assessment of tax and not merely a fraction of the total depreciation allowance taken into account in levying charge upon a part of the taxable income at a rate determined by the total world income We think that the law does not make any distinction as to the part of income which was brought to assessment under the Indian Income tax Act It follows therefore that under the proviso it is the greater of the two depreciation allowances actually allowed that has to be taken into account in computing the written down value under section The word allowed used in the proviso thus takes its colour from the expression all depreciation actually allowed to him under this Act as used in Section and the words all depreciation actually allowed under any laws or rules of a Part State used in paragraph The material part of the Rule is In any case in which the Income tax Officer is of opinion that the actual amount of the income profits or gains accruing or arising to any person residing out of the taxable territories whether directly or indirectly in the taxable territories cannot be ascertained the amount of such income profits or gains for the purposes of assessment to income tax may be calculated on such percentage of the turnover so accruing or arising as the Income tax Officer may consider to be reasonable or on an amount which bears the same proportion to the total profits of the business of such person such profits being computed in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act as the receipts so accruing or arising bear to the total receipts of the business or in such other manner as the Income tax Officer may deem suitable Where from the evidence actual income can be determined the rule has no application Again the rule contemplates the computation of income of a non resident in three different ways on such percentage of the turnover so accruing or arising as the Income tax Officer may consider to be reasonable on an amount which bears the same proportion to the total profits of the business of such person as the receipts so accruing or arising bear to the total receipts of the business such profit being computed in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act and in such other manner as the Income tax Officer may deem suitable Paragraph of the Taxation Laws Part States Removal of Difficulties Order applies only to cases in which in making an assessment under the Indian Income tax Act depreciation allowed has to be taken into account in computing the total profits or income What must however be noticed is that in the ascertainment of total profits either for the purposes of assessment in the ordinary manner when the income of the assessee is determinable or where a fraction is to be adopted for the purpose of the second method contemplated by there is no scope for assuming that only a fraction of the depreciation is actually allowed There is therefore no warrant either in vi or in paragraph of the Taxation Laws Part States Removal of Difficulties Order or in framed under the Indian Income tax Act for the view that depreciation allowed is a fraction of the total depreciation of the business ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeals are dismissed with costs
