HEADNOTE The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act which by empowered <ORG> to constitute mining areas for the purpose of providing them with certain amenities after hearing objections from the lessees by to impose and collect a cess not exceeding of the valuation of the minerals at the pit mouth and by created a fund to which the cess was to be credited The petitioners case inter alia was that the impugned Act and the rules made thereunder were ultra vires the powers of <ORG> the cess levied thereunder was not a fee but a duty of excise on coal within Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and repugnant to Coal Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act Act XXXII of and alternatively even supposing it was a fee relatable to Entries and of List II it was hit by Entry of List I read with the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act LIII of or by Entry of List I read with the Industries Development and Regulation Act Act LXV of It was urged on behalf of the <ORG> inter alia that the cess was a fee and not a duty of excise and the competence of <ORG> to levy it was not affected by the Central Act Held per <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> Although there can be no generic difference between a tax and a fee since both are compulsory exactions of money by public authorities there is this distinction between them that whereas a tax is imposed for public purposes and requires no consideration to support it a fee is levied essentially for services rendered and there must be an element of quid pro quo between the person who pays it and the public authority that imposes it Whether a cess is one or the other would naturally depend on the facts of each case The distinction is recognised by the Constitution which while empowering the appropriate <ORG>s to levy taxes under the Entries in the three lists refers to their power to levy fees in respect of any such matters except the fees taken in court and tests have been laid down by this <ORG> for determining the character of an impugned levy The limitation imposed by the latter part of Entry of List II is a limitation on the legislative competence of the <ORG> <ORG> itself and the test whether a statute passed by <ORG> thereunder was ultra vires would be whether the requisite declaration under Entry List I has been made by <ORG> by law covering the same field or not it is not necessary in order to make the declaration effective that rules should also be made and enforced Consequently in the absence of the requisite <ORG>ary declaration the competence of the Orissa <ORG> <ORG> under Entry read with Entry of the List II was not impaired and the impugned Act must be deemed to have repeal ed the Central Act so far as that <ORG> was concerned This case incidentally discloses that in regard to the requisite <ORG>ary declaration prescribed by Entry in List I in its application to the pre constitution Acts under corresponding Entry in List I of the Constitution Act of there is a lacuna which has not been covered by any clauses of the Adaptation of Laws Order The first petitioner is a public limited company which has its registered office at Bombay In December <ORG> passed the impugned Act and it received the assent of the Governor of Orissa on December It was however not reserved for the consideration of the President of India nor has it received his assent This petition is resisted by respondent on several grounds It is urged on its behalf that the levy imposed by the impugned Act is a fee relatable to Entries and in List II and its validity is not affected either by Entry read with Act LIII of or by Entry read with Act LXV of After this appeal was fully argued before us Mr <NAME> suggested and Mr <NAME> did not object that we should hear the learned Attorney General on the question as to whether even if the levy imposed by the impugned Act is a fee relatable to Entries and in List II of the Seventh Schedule it would nevertheless be ultra vires having regard to the provisions of Entry in List I read with Central Act LIII of The first question which falls for consideration is whether the levy imposed by the impugned Act amounts to a fee relatable to Entry read with Entry in List II Before we deal with this question it is necessary to consider the difference between the concept of tax and that of a fee It is true that between a tax and a fee there is no generic difference by public authorities but whereas a tax is imposed for public purposes and is not and need not be supported by any consideration of service rendered in return a fee is levied essentially for services rendered and as such there is an element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the fee and the public authority which imposes it There is however an element of compulsion in the imposition of both tax and fee When the <ORG> decides to render a specific service to any area or to any class of persons it is not open to the said area or to the said class of persons to plead that they do not want the service and therefore they should be exempted from the payment of the cess Though there is an element of quid pro quo between the tax payer and the public authority there is no option to the tax payer in the matter of receiving the service determined by public authority In other words whether or not a particular cess levied by a statute amounts to a fee or tax would always be a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case Several Entries in the Three Lists empower the appropriate <ORG>s to levy taxes but apart from the power to levy taxes thus conferred each List specifically refers to the power to levy fees in respect of any of the matters covered in the said List excluding of course the fees taken in any <ORG> Under this section every religious institution had to pay to the <ORG> annual contribution not exceeding of its income for the services rendered to it by the said <ORG> and the argument was that the contribution thus exacted was not a fee but a tax and as such outside the competence of <ORG> The learned judge examined the scheme of the Act and observed that the material fact which negatives the theory of fees in the present case is that the money raised by the levy of the contribution is not earmarked or specified for defraying the expense that the <ORG> has to incur in performing the services All the collections go to the consolidated fund of the <ORG> and all the expenses have to be met not out of those collections but out of the general revenues by a proper method of appropriation as is done in the The learned judge no doubt added that the said circumstance was not conclusive and pointed out that in fact there was a total absence of any co relation between the expenses incurred by the <ORG> and the amount raised by contribution It would thus be seen that the tests which have to be applied in determining the character of any impugned levy have been laid down by this <ORG> in these three decisions and it is in the light of these tests that we have to consider the merits of the rival contentions raised before us in the present petition Besides as we have already pointed out we have now three decisions of this <ORG> which have authoritatively dealt with this matter and it is in the light of the said decisions that the present question has to be considered The lands in question were statutorily exempted from taxation and it was urged against the validity of the impost that the levy of the said impost was not a service charge but a tax and since it contravened the exemption from taxation granted to the land it was invalid In appreciating the weight of the said relevant circumstances <ORG> was impressed by the fact that the lands in question formed an important part of the national wealth of the Province and their proper administration including in particular protection against fire is a matter of high public concern as well as one of particular interest to individuals payers and those individuals who had a special interest in having their property protected This decision was substantially based on the ground that the statutory board performs no particular service for the dairyman or the owner of a milk depot for which his contribution may be considered as a fee or recompense that is to say the element of quid pro quo was absent qua the persons on whom the levy had been imposed As the preamble shows it has been passed because it was thought expedient to constitute mining areas and <ORG> in the <ORG> of Orissa Section of the Act provides for the constitution of a mining area whenever it appears to <ORG> that it is necessary and expedient to provide amenities like communications water supply and electricity for the better development of any area in the <ORG> of Orissa wherein any mine is situated or to provide for the welfare of the residents or to workers in any such areas within which persons employed in a mine or a group of mines reside or work After considering objections received <ORG> is authorised to issue a notification constituting a mining area under Section provides for the constitution of the Oriss<ORG> The fund has to be utilised to meet expenditure incurred in connection with such measures which in the opinion of <ORG> are necessary or expedient for providing amenities like communications water supply and electricity for the better development of the mining areas and to meet the welfare of the labour and other persons residing or working in the mining areas Under <ORG> is given the power to decide whether any particular expenditure is or is not debitable to the fund and their decision is made final and imposes on <ORG> an obligation to publish annually in the gazette a report of the activities financed from the fund together with an estimate of receipts and expenditure of the fund and a statement of account Section prescribes the mode of constituting an advisory committee Section deals with the appointment and functions of the statutory authorities to carry out the purpose of the Act while confers on <ORG> power to make rules Section prescribes penalties and provides for prosecutions and gives protection to the specified authorities or officers in respect of anything done or intended to be done by them in good faith in pursuance of the Act or any rules or order made thereunder Section which is the last section confers on <ORG> the power to do anything which may appear to them to be necessary for the purpose of removing difficulties in giving effect to the provisions of the Act The scheme of the Act thus clearly shows that it has been passed for the purpose of the development of mining areas in the <ORG> The basis for the operation of the Act is the constitution of a mining area and it is in regard to mining areas thus constituted that the provisions of the Act come into play Orissa is an underdeveloped <ORG> in the Union of India though it has a lot of mineral wealth of great potential value Un fortunately its mineral wealth is located generally in areas sparsely populated with bad communications Inevitably the exploitation of the minerals is handicapped by lack of communications and the difficulty experienced in keeping the labour force sufficiently healthy and in congenial surroundings The mineral development of the <ORG> therefore requires that provision should be made for improving the communications by constructing good roads and by providing means of transport such as tramways supply of water and electricity would also help It would also be necessary to provide for amenities of sanitation and education to the labour force in order to attract workmen to the area Before the Act was passed it appears that the mine owners tried to put up small length roads and tramways for their own individual purpose but that obviously could not be as effective as roads constructed by the <ORG> and tramway service provided by it It is on a consideration of these factors that <ORG> decided to take an active part in unsystematic development of its mineral areas which would help the mine owners in moving their minerals quickly through the shortest route and would attract labour to assist the excavation of the minerals Thus there can be no doubt that the primary and the principal object of the Act is to develop the mineral areas in the <ORG> and to assist more efficient and extended exploitation of its mineral wealth Even before an area is notified the mine owners are allowed an opportunity to put forward their objections It would thus be clear that the administration of the fund would be subject to public scrutiny and persons who are called upon to pay the levy would have an opportunity to see whether the cess collected from them has been properly utilised for the purposes for which it is intended to be used There is an element of quid pro quo in the scheme the cess collected is constituted into a specific fund and it has not become a part of the consolidated fund its application is regulated by a statute and is confined to its purposes and there is a definite co relation between the impost and the purpose of the Act which is to render service to the notified area It is however urged that the cess levied by is in substance and reality a duty of excise As we have already noticed provides that the rate of such levy shall not exceed per centum of the valuation of the minerals at the pit mouth in other words it is the value of the minerals produced which is the basis for calculating the cess payable by mine owners and that precisely is the nature in which duty of excise is levied under Entry in List I The said Entry empowers <ORG> to impose duties of excise inter alia on goods manufactured or produced in India It is not disputed that under Entry in List II read with Entry in the said List <ORG> can levy a fee in respect of mines and mineral development Entry provides that fees in respect of any of the matters in the said List can be imposed by <ORG> subject of course to the exception of fees taken in any Court This argument is based on two considerations The first relates to the form in which the levy is imposed and the second relates to the extent of the levy authorised The extent of the levy authorised would always depend upon the nature of the services intended to be rendered and the financial obligations incurred thereby The method in which the fee is recovered is a matter of convenience and by itself it cannot fix upon the levy the character of the duty of excise The next question which arises is even if the cess is a fee and as such may be relatable to Entries and in List II its validity is still open to challenge because the legislative competence of <ORG> under Entry is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> and that takes us to Entry in List I This Entry reads thus Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest In other words if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by <ORG> as required by Entry and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the law Section of the Act contains a declaration as to the expediency and control by <ORG> It reads thus It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and oil fields and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided Section of the Act provides that no mining lease shall be granted after the commencement of this Act otherwise than in accordance with the rules made under this Act Section empowers <ORG> to make rules by notification for regulating the grant of mining leases or for prohibiting the grant of such leases in respect of any mineral or in any area Sections and thus purport to prescribe necessary conditions in accordance with which mining leases have to be executed Section of the Act however empowers <ORG> to make rules by notification in the official gazette for the conservation and development of minerals It is true that no rules have in fact been framed by <ORG> in regard to the levy and collection of any fees but in our opinion that would not make any difference If it is held that this Act contains the declaration referred to in Entry there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covers the field of conservation and development of minerals and the said field is indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act What Entry provides is that the legislative competence of <ORG> is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> and Entry in List I requires a declaration by <ORG> by law that regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the <ORG> in public interest Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be competent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines under the control of the <ORG> In such a case the test must be whether the legislative declaration covers the field or not Reverting then to of the said Act it is clear that the declaration contained in the said section is put in the passive voice but in the context there would be no difficulty in holding that the said declaration by necessary implication has been made by Dominion law It is a declaration contained in a section passed by <ORG> and so it is obvious that it is a declaration by a Dominion law but the question is Can this declaration by a Dominion law be regarded constitutionally as declaration by <ORG> which is required by Entry in List I It has been urged before us by the learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr <NAME> that in dealing with this question we should bear in mind two general considerations of the Constitution as an existing law and the effect of the said constitutional provision must be that the continuance of the existing law would be as effective and to the same extent after the Constitution came into force as before It is urged that after the said Act was passed and before the Con stitution came into force no Provincial <ORG> could have validly made a law in respect of the field covered by the said Act and it would be commonsense to assume that the effect of the continuance of the said law under Art In other words if no Provincial <ORG> could have trespassed on the field covered by the said Act before the Constitution the position would and must be the same even after the Constitution came into force It is also contended that for the purpose of bringing the provision of existing laws into accord with the provisions of the Constitution the President was given power to make by order appropriate adaptations and modifications of such laws and the object of making such adaptations obviously was to make the continuance of the existing laws fully effective The relevant clause in the Adaptation of Laws Order on which reliance has been placed in support of this argument is el This clause provides that subject to the provisions of this Order any reference by whatever form of words in any existing law to any authority competent at the date of the passing of that law to exercise any powers or authorities or to discharge any functions in any part of India shall where a corresponding new authority has been constituted by or under the Constitution have effect until duly repealed or amended as if it were a reference to that new authority Part deals with the adaptation of Central Laws and indicates the adaptation made therein Part deals with the adaptation of Provincial Laws and follows the same pattern and Part III is a Supplementary Part which contains provisions in the nature of supplementary provisions in substance is to equate an authority competent at the date of the passing of the existing law to exercise any powers or authorities or to discharge any functions with a corresponding new authority which has been constituted by or under the Constitution It is difficult to construe the first part of this clause to include authorities to which no reference is made by any words in terms but to which such reference may be implied and quite clearly <ORG> is not expressly referred to in In construing the present clause we think it would be straining the language of the clause to hold that an authority to which no reference is made by words in any part of the existing law could claim the benefit of this clause Besides there is no doubt that when the clause refers to any authority competent to exercise any powers or authorities or to discharge any functions it refers to the powers authorities or functions attributable to the existing law itself that is to say authorities which are competent to exercise powers or to discharge functions under the existing laws are intended to be equated with corresponding new authorities It is impossible to hold that <ORG> is an authority which was competent to exercise any power or to discharge any function under the existing law We have carefully considered the arguments urged before us by the learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr <NAME> but we are unable to hold that cl can be pressed into service for the purpose of supporting the conclusion that the declaration by <ORG> implied in of Act LIII of can by virtue of cl be held to be a declaration by <ORG> within the meaning of the relevant Entries in the Constitution There is another possible argument which may prima facie lead to the same conclusion and cl of the Adaptation of Laws Order is that under of Act LIII of there is a declaration by <ORG> as suggested by the petitioners and the learned Additional Solicitor General Would that meet the requirements of Entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule It is difficult to answer this question in the affirmative because the relevant provisions of the Constitution are prospective and the declaration by <ORG> specified by Entry must be declaration made by <ORG> subsequent to the date when the Constitution came into force Unless a declaration is made by <ORG> after the Constitution came into force it will not satisfy the requirements of Entry and that inevitably would mean that the impugned Act is validly enacted under Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule Clause reads thus Any <ORG> <ORG> or authority required or empowered to enforce any law in force in the territory of India immediately before the appointed day shall notwithstanding that this Order makes no provision or insufficient provision for the adaptation of the law for the purpose of bringing it into accord with the provisions of the Constitution construe the law with all such adaptations as are necessary for the said purpose There is no occasion to make any adaptation in construing Act LIII of for bringing it into accord with the provisions of the Constitution at all and there is no constitutional defect in the said Act for the avoidance of which any adaptation is necessary Incidentally the present case discloses that in regard to the requisite parliamentary declaration prescribed by Entry in List I in its application to the pre Constitution Act under corresponding Entry in List I of the Constitution Act of there is a lacuna which has not been covered by any clauses of the Adaptation of Laws Order that however is a matter for <ORG> to consider There is one more point which is yet to be considered In this connection he relies on the said Entry which deals with industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest and Industries Development and Regulation Act LXV of Section of this Act declares that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule The last chapter deals with miscellaneous incidental matters WANCHOO I have read the judgment just delivered by my learned brother <NAME> and regret that I have not been able to persuade myself that the cess levied in this case on all extracted minerals from any mine in any mining area at a rate not exceeding five per centum of the value of the minerals at the pit mouth by <ORG> under of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act No XXVII of hereinafter called the Act is a fee properly so called and not a duty of ex cise The facts are all set out in the judgment just delivered and I need not repeat them which persons employed in a mine or a group of mines reside or work to constitute such an area to be a mining area for the purposes of the Act to define the limits of the area to include within such area any local area contiguous to the same and defined in the notification and to exclude from such area any local area comprised therein and defined in the notification The Fund is to be applied to meet expenditure incurred in connection with such measures which in the opinion of <ORG> are necessary or expedient for providing amenities like communications water supply and electricity for the better development of mining areas and to meet the welfare of labour and other persons residing or working in the mining areas Then come other provisions for working out the above provisions including which gives power to <ORG> to frame rules to carry The constitutional competence of <ORG> to levy the cess under the Act is attacked on two main grounds The petition has been opposed on behalf of the State of Orissa and the main contentions urged on its behalf are that the cess is a fee properly so called and not a duty of excise and therefore <ORG> was competent to levy it and the two Central Act do not affect that competence The first question therefore that falls for consideration is whether the cess in this ease is a tax or a fee It was also pointed that the essence of a tax is compulsion that is to say it is imposed under statutory power without the taxpayer consent and the payment is enforced by law The second characteristic of a tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax As the object of a tax is not to confer any special benefit upon any particular individual there is as it is said no element of quid pro quo between the tax payer and the public authority As to fees it was pointed out that a fee is generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some governmental agency The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the <ORG> in rendering the service though in many cases the costs are arbitrarily assessed Ordinarily the fees are uniform and no account is taken of the varying abilities of different recipients to pay Finally it was pointed out that the distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as a part of a common burden while a fee is a payment for a special benefit or privilege Public interest seems to be at the basis of all impositions but in a fee it is some special benefit which the individual receives The consequence of these principles was that if as we hold a fee is regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered it is absolutely necessary that the levy of fees should on the face of the legislative provision be co related to the expenses incurred by <ORG> in rendering the services If the money thus paid is set apart and appropriated specifically for the performance of such work and is not merged in the public revenues for the benefit of the general public it could be counted as fees and not a tax Having laid down these principles that case then considered the vires of of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act No XIX of and it was pointed out that the material fact which negatived the theory of fees in that case was that the money raised by levy of the contribution was not ear marked or specified for defraying the expenses that the <ORG> had to incur in performing the services All the collections went to the consolidated fund of the <ORG> and all the expenses had to be met not out of those collections but out of the general revenues by a proper method of appropriation as was done in the case of other government expenses That in itself might not be conclusive but in that case there was total absence of any co relation between the expenses incurred by the <ORG> and the amount raised by contribution under the provision of and in those circumstances the theory of return or counter payment or quid pro quo could not have any possible application to that case This imposition was levied for the purpose of due administration of the trust property and for defraying the expenses incurred in connection with the same Thus in fees there is always an element of quid pro quo which is absent in a tax But in order that the collections made by the Government can rank as fees there must be co relation between the levy imposed and the expenses incurred by the <ORG> for the purpose of rendering such services These decisions clearly bring out the difference between a tax and a fee and generally speaking there is always an element of quid pro quo in a fee and the amount raised through a fee is co related to the expenses necessary for rendering the services which are the basis of quid pro quo because a fund is created in which collections are credited and some services may be rendered to the persons from whom collections are made If that were so it will be possible to convert many taxes not otherwise leviable into fees by the device of creating a special fund and attaching some service to be rendered through that fund to the persons from whom collections are made Item of List I gives power to levy duties of excise exclusively to the <ORG> and is in these terms Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except a alcoholic liquors for human consumption opium Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics but including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub paragraph of this entry This item gives power to <ORG> to impose duties of excise on all goods manufactured in a <ORG> constitution in which there is a division of legislative powers between Central and Provincial legislatures it appears to be inevitable that controversy should arise whether one or other legislature is not exceeding its own and encroaching on the other constitutional legislative power and in such a controversy it is a principle which their Lordships do not hesitate to apply in the present case that it is not the name of the tax but its real nature its pith and substance as it has sometimes been said which must determine into what category it falls It seems to have been urged that because in some cases a duty of excise may be levied on the occasion of the first sale and a sales tax may also be levied on the same occasion there is really no difference between the two It is however clear that a duty of excise is primarily a tax on goods manufactured or produced it is not a tax on the sale of goods though the taxing authority may as a matter of concession to the producer not charge the tax immediately the goods are produced and may postpone it to make it easy for the producer to pay the tax till the first sale is made by him nevertheless the charge is still on the goods and is therefore a duty of excise On the other hand a sales tax can only be levied when a sale is made and there is nothing to prevent its levy on the first sale Let me therefore see what <ORG> has done in the present case It has levied a cess at a rate not exceeding five per centum on the value of minerals at the pit mouth on all extracted minerals The pith and substance of the cess in this case falls fairly and squarely within entry of List I and is therefore a duty of excise which cannot be levied by <ORG> I may in this connection refer to the cesses levied by <ORG> and <ORG> by Act XXXII of and by the Act No LXV of of Act LXV of lays down that there may be levied and collected as a cess for the purposes of that Act on all goods manufactured or produced in any such scheduled industry as may be specified in this behalf by <ORG> by notified order a duty of excise at a rate not exceeding two annas per centum of the value of the goods This again is clearly a tax on goods produced or manufactured and is in the nature of a duty of excise the basis of the tax being so much of the value of the goods It is however urged that the method employed in the Act for realising the cess is only a method of quantification of the fee and merely because of this quantification the pith and substance of the impost does not change from a fee to a duty of excise Reference in this connection was made to three cases of quantification It was held that the tax was a tax on lands and buildings within the meaning of item of List II of the same Schedule and that the basis of the tax which was the annual value would not convert it into a tax on income or capital value Looking to the pith and substance of the tax it was held in that case that it was a tax on lands and buildings That decision was in the circumstances of that case right because the intention of the legislature was not to tax the income of any one the essential character of the tax in that case was to tax the lands and buildings and the annual value of the lands and buildings was only taken as a mode of levying the tax It was urged that this amounted to a capital levy within entry of List I but the court repelled that contention and held that the levy was in pith and substance a tax on lands which came within entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act This decision also if I may say so with respect is correct for the basic idea was to tax lands and some method had to be found for doing so and the method evolved though it might look like a capital levy was in pith and substance not so <ORG> also pointed out that where there is an apparent conflict between an Act of <ORG> and an Act of the Provincial Legislature we must try to ascertain the pith and substance or the true nature and character of the conflicting provisions and that before an Act is declared ultra vires there should be an attempt to reconcile the two conflicting jurisdictions and only if such a reconciliation should prove I Bom If this were permissible many taxes not otherwise leviable would be converted into fees by the simple device of creating a special fund and attaching certain services to be rendered from the amount in that fund Let me illustrate how taxes can be turned into fees on the so called basis of quantification with the help of the device of creating a fund and attaching certain services to be rendered out of monies in the fund In order to meet the expenses of tendering such services suppose the legislature imposes a tax on every one in the district at per centum of the net total income other than agricultural income the amount so collected is put in a separate fund and ear marked for such special services to be rendered to the residents of that district Compare what has been done in this case Further the section goes on to mention provision for the welfare of residents or workers in any such area which would include such things as social security and social insurance provident funds employer liability workmen compensation invalidity and old age pensions and maternity benefits and may be even employment and unemployment The next contention on behalf of the State of Orissa is that if the cess is not justified as a fee it is a tax under item of List II of the Seventh Schedule Item provides for taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development This raises a question as to what are taxes on mineral rights Obviously taxes on mineral rights must be different from taxes on goods produced in the nature of duties of excise If taxes on mineral rights also include taxes on minerals produced there would be no difference between taxes on mineral rights and duties of excise under item of List I A comparison of Lists I and II of the Seventh Schedule shows that the same tax is not put in both the Lists The difference can be understood if one sees that before minerals are extracted and become liable to duties of excise somebody has got to work the mines The usual method of working them is for the owner of the mine to grant mining leases to those who have got the capital to work the mines There should therefore be no difficulty in holding that taxes on mineral rights are taxes on the right to extract minerals and not taxes on the minerals actually extracted Thus tax on mineral rights would be confined for example to taxes on leases of mineral rights and on premium or royalty for that It is said that there may be cases where the owner himself extracts minerals and does not give any right of extraction to somebody else and that in such cases in the absence of mining leases or sub leases there would be no way of levying tax on mineral right Where there is a lease of the building the annual value is determined by the lease money but there are many cases where owners themselves live in buildings In such cases also taxes on buildings are levied on the annual value worked out according to certain rules There would be no difficulty where an owner himself works the mine to value the mineral rights on the same principles on which leases of mineral rights are made and then to tax the royalty which for example the owner might have got if instead of working the mine himself he had leased it out to somebody else Therefore the present case is not a tax on mineral rights it is a tax on the minerals actually produced and can be no different in pith and substance from a tax on goods produced which comes under Item of List I as duty of excise The present levy therefore under of the Act cannot be justified as a tax on mineral rights In the view I have taken it is not necessary to consider the other point raised on behalf of the petitioners namely that even if it is a fee in view of the two Central Act mentioned earlier the <ORG> was not competent to pass the Act
