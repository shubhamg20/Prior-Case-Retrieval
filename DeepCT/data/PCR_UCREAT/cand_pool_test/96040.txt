The respondents opposed the aforesaid levy contending that they were manufacturing in their factory dal from various legumes and therefore not only they were not producers of agricultural commodities but in view of the description of legumes set out in the Schedule of the Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam the dal of such legumes in the Processed form was not a specified agricultural produce and therefore a transaction of sale in respect of them at the hands of the respondents even if it takes place in the Market Area would not permit <ORG> to levy market fee on such transaction and that they were not liable to buy the same The respondents approached <ORG> by filing writ petitions under Art contending that <ORG> continue to levy fee on the transaction of dal and that it had no authority to do so It was contended in the writ petitions that merely amending or adding to the list of agricultural produce set out in the Schedule by itself without any thing more would not enable <ORG> to levy market fee on the sale of such agricultural produce because before levying market fee the agricultural produce has to be notified as specified agricultural produce by issuing either a notification under Sec It is an indisputable canon of construction that where an expression is defined in the statute unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context the expression has to be construed as having the same meaning assigned to it in the dictionary clause of the statute Legislative enactments in the State of Uttar Pradesh are enacted in the Hindi language and its official and authentic translation in English is primarily simultaneously published The notification dated April specified the legumes therein enumerated as specified agricultural produce for various Market Areas This tongue twister was explained to mean that legume itself is Dwi Daliya Utpadan i the whole grain is made of two folds Dwi Daliya is a grain composed of two folds and certainly not many folds On a strict construction the two dals i two parts forming the whole grain both are comprehended in the expression Dwi Daliya Utpadan And when the agricultural produce enumerated in the Schedule such as Gram including its processed part is reproduced in the notification as Dwi Daliya Utpadan the dal of each of the legumes therein mentioned became specified agricultural produce Redress of a grievance depending upon deciding a disputed question of fact cannot be rendered in this Court when there is want of a pleading in this behalf and want of a decision by <ORG> on the point The respondents contended that they were manufacturing in their factory dal from various legumes and therefore not only they were not producers of agricultural commodity but in view of the description of legumes set out in the Schedule the dal of such legumes in the processed form is not a specified agricultural produce and therefore a transaction of sale in respect of them at the hands of the respondents even if it takes place in the Market Area would not permit the appellant to levy market fee on such transaction and they were not liable to pay the same The respondents approached <ORG> by filing writ petitions under Art It was contended that merely amending or adding to the list of agricultural produce set out in the Schedule by itself without anything more would not enable <ORG> to levy market fee on the sale of such agricultural produce because before levying market fee the agricultural produce has to be notified as specified agricultural produce by issuing either a notification under Sec If the contention raised on behalf of the appellant in the first batch of appeals is accepted the judgment of <ORG> in the second batch of appeals will have to be quashed and set aside without anything more to mean an area notified as such under Section or as modified under Section which inter alia includes the power to levy and collect market fee in the circumstances therein mentioned A Committee shall for the Purposes of the Act have the power to It was said that the dal which is obtained by applying a process of manufacture to the whole grain of legumes is neither an agricultural produce and at any rate it is not a specified agricultural produce To resolve this controversy one will have to seek light from the definition of expression agricultural produce as set out in Sec It is an indisputable can on of construction that where an expression is defined in the statute unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context the expression has to be construed as having the same meaning assigned to it in the dictionary clause of the statute Suppose a producer sells neither Gram nor Peas each by itself but mixes Gram and Peas according to the contention canvassed on behalf of the respondents this mixture would be not an agricultural produce The contention can be negatived by referring to the definition which says agricultural produce means such items of produce of agriculture omitting the words which are not necessary for the present purpose as are specified in the Schedule such as Gram and Peas as also an admixture of two or more of such items i admixture of Gram and Peas Agricultural produce means such items of agricultural produce namely Gram as specified in the Schedule and it shall include any such items i Gram in its processed form Even the respondents did not contend on the contrary it was the sheet anchor of their submission that a split legume is obtained by a manufacturing process of whole grain of legumes Saboot as it is now described and that dal i the whole grain split into two folds is its processed form acquired by manufacturing process This very conclusion can be reached by a slightly different route As is well known the legislative enactments in the State of are enacted primarily in Hindi language and its official and authentic translation in English is simultaneously published Bearing this in mind we turn to the notification dated April specifying legumes therein enumerated as specified agricultural produce for various Market Areas This tongue twister was explained to us to mean that legume itself is Dwi Daliya Utpadan i the whole grain is made of two folds Dwi Daliya is a grain composed of two folds and certainly not many folds Concise Oxford Dictionary specifies the meaning of legume to be fruit edible part pode of leguminous plant vegetable used for food and leguminous to mean like of the botanical family of pulse And in common parlance pulse connotes legume and denotes dal of legume Reverting however to the heading under which legumes are enumerated in notification it must be confessed that it clearly connotes the meaning to be given to the whole grain and denotes dal i split folds as specified agricultural produce The Hindi protagonists used the expression Dwi Dalia Utpadan meaning thereby double folded grain called Gram Peas Arhar moong etc On a strict construction the two dals i two parts forming the whole grain both are comprehended in the expression Dwi Dalia Utpadan Therefore it is crystal clear that while enumerating legumes in the Schedule and reproduced in the notification to make them specified agricultural produce the framers intended to include both the grain as a whole and its splits parts the dal And when the agricultural produce enumerated in the Schedule such as Gram including its processed part is reproduced in the notification as Dwi Dalia Utpadan the dal of each of the legumes therein mentioned became specified agricultural produce This Court has observed at page that if paddy is purchased in a particular market area by a rice miller and the same paddy is converted into rice and sold then the rice miller will be liable to pay market fee on his purchase of paddy from the agriculturist producer under sub clause of section iii <ORG> was also placed on the observation at page where the court observed if Catechu is a product of khar trees by some processing as prima facie it appears to us to be so then it is plain that market fee can be charged only on the purchase of khar wood and not on the sale of Catechu The submission does not commend to us because it proceeds on an erroneous assumption that the Act was primarily enacted for the protection of producers of scheduled agricultural produce Viewed from either angle we find no merit in the submission It was urged that rice is nothing but dehusked paddy and when the paddy is dehusked there is no change in the identity of the goods It was not pointed out to us that the various provisions of the relevant Sales Tax Law which came for consideration of this <ORG> in those four decisions did or did not have a definition such as we have of agricultural produce in Sec wherein in the context of the Act it was held that cotton ginned and unginned and therefore it was held that no market fee was leviable on the transaction of sale of cotton waste It cannot be said to be a bye product of cotton but it is cotton none the less minus the removed seed The question that came up for consideration before this <ORG> was whether Sales tax was payable in respect of sales of patasa narda and alchidana The contention arose in the context of the provision contained in Sec of the Bombay Sales Tax Act in its application to the State of Gujarat which provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act but subject to the conditions or exceptions if any set out against each of the goods specified in column of Schedule A no tax shall be payable on the sales or purchases of any goods specified in the Schedule But we do not propose to rest our decision on the approach to various commodities commercially recognised distinct under relevant Sales Tax Law A of the Act <ORG> had the power to add to amend or omit any of the items of agricultural produce specified in the Schedule and if by the notification dated January <ORG> purported to substitute the Schedule under the Heading legumes by putting into bracket by the side of each enumerated legume Saboot or Dala Hua that by itself would not make such agricultural produce specified agricultural produce As that was the only contention canvassed before this Court in the second batch of appeals as we find no merit in it the second batch of appeals will also have to be allowed <NAME> Lastly the respondents contended that if the view taken by <ORG> on the question that split grain of legume that is dal was not comprehended in the whole grain of legume as set out in the Schedule and therefore the same was not a specified agricultural is held not to be correct and accordingly the judgment of <ORG> would have to be upset all the matters may be remitted to <ORG> for disposing of other contentions canvassed on behalf of the respondents who were petitioners in <ORG> as <ORG> declined to examine them as the writ petitions were allowed on this one narrow contention which according to <ORG> went to the root of the matter Before <ORG> the respondents raised various contentions It was said by Mr <NAME> referring to the writ petition in which he appeared that there were other contentions which the respondents wanted to canvass but which <ORG> declined to examine The remand is limited to those questions which find their place in the writ petitions and which <ORG> declined to examine
