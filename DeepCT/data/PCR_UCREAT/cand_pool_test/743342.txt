HEADNOTE The appellant is a firm carrying on business within the octroi limits of Ludhiana Municipality <ORG> held that Sambhar salt was common salt within the meaning of item that the imposition of tax on it by the respondent under item was illegal and that there fore the court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit On appeal <ORG> proceeded on the assumption that Sambhar salt was common salt but held that even so <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit as the Act provided a remedy by way of appeal against the wrong orders of the authorities thereunder On behalf of the appellant it was contended that the respondent had no power to impose terminal tax on common salt under item of the Schedule and therefore the tax having been imposed contrary to the provisions of the Act <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain the suit The contention on behalf of the respondent was that the respondent has power to impose terminal tax on common salt under the provisions of the Act that the imposition of tax under a wrong entry could be rectified only in the manner prescribed by the Act and that <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit for the refund of the tax collected when a specific remedy is available under the Act The statute may specifically provide for vesting the jurisdiction of civil Courts even if there was no such specific exclusion if it creates a liability not existing before and gives a special and particular remedy for the aggrieved party the remedy provided by it must be followed In the present case the liability to pay terminal tax is created by the Act and a remedy is given to a party aggrieved in the enforcement of the liability The party aggrieved can only pursue the remedy provided by the Act and he cannot file a suit in a civil court in that regard In a case where <ORG> has undoubted power to levy tax under a particular entry in respect of an article but it levies tax under a wrong entry not applicable to that article the said committee only commits a mistake or an error in fixing the rate of tax payable in respect of the said article and no question of jurisdiction but only a question of detail is involved The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal raises the question whether a suit would lie in a civil Court claiming refund of the terminal tax collected by a municipality under the provisions of the Punjab Municipal Act Punjab Act III of hereinafter called the Act It carries on business within the limits of the Ludhiana Municipality The respondent inter alia contended that Sambhar salt was not common salt and <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit The Senior Subordinate judge Ludhiana held that Sambhar salt was common salt within the meaning of item of the Schedule that the imposition of tax on it by the respondent under item of the Schedule was illegal and that therefore the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit On appeal <ORG> proceeded on the assumption that Sambhar salt was salt common but held that even so <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit as the Act provided for a remedy by way of appeal against the wrong orders of the authorities thereunder The present appeal has been preferred by the appellant by way of certificate issued by <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant contends that the respondent has no power to impose terminal tax on salt common under item of the Schedule to the said Notification and therefore the tax having been imposed contrary to the provisions of the Act <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain the suit On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the respondent argues that the respondent has power to impose terminal tax on common salt under the provisions of the Act that the imposition of tax under a wrong entry could be rectified only in the manner prescribed by the Act and that <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the refund of tax collected when a specific remedy is available under the Act Under <ORG> has power to impose with the previous sanction of <ORG> any tax which <ORG> has power to impose in the State subject to any general or special orders which <ORG> may make in that behalf Section provides for a penalty if any person brings any article liable to the payment of terminal tax into the prescribed limits without paying the said tax Section gives a right of appeal Under the liability of any person to be taxed cannot be questioned in any manner or by any authority other than that provided in the Act under sub thereof no refund of any tax shall be claimed by any person otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act and rules thereunder It will be seen from the aforesaid provisions that the power to impose a terminal tax and the liability to pay the same is conferred or imposed on the municipal com mittee and the assessee respectively by the provisions of the Act It is said that the reference provided to <ORG> is in the discretion of the appellate authority and he can with impunity refuse to do so even if any difficult question is involved in the appeal In such a situation the question arised whether <ORG> can entertain a suit for a refund of the tax wrongfully collected from an assessee and if so what are the limits of its jurisdiction We shall now proceed to consider the relevant principles governing the said question <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> describes as follows the three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon a statute One is where there was a liability existing at common law and that liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law there unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy the party suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy The second class of case is where the statute gives the right to sue merely but provides no particular from of remedy there the party But there is a third class viz existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it The remedy provided by the statute must be followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class It is clear from the said passage that in a case where the liability is created by a statute a party aggrieved must pursue the special remedy provided by it and he cannot pursue his remedy in <ORG> But there is also an equally well settled principle governing the scope of <ORG> jurisdiction in a case where a statute created a liability and provided a remedy In spite of this bar the plaintiff brought a suit for damages for injury alleged to have been caused to his field There the assessment was made in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Municipalities Act and the rules made thereunder whether a suit would lie in <ORG> for an injunction restraining <ORG> from realizing the tax demanded from a person on the ground that he was not the owner of the lorries the subject matter of tax and consequently the demand made on him was illegal and ultra vires of the <ORG> This is a case where it may be said that <ORG> acted not under the Act but outside the Act in as much as the tax on vehicles was payable by the owners only but not by those who did not own them But when an order is made which is outside that Act then the provisions of can have no application to such an order which itself is outside the Act In short the Bench laid down that in two kinds of cases was no bar to the jurisdiction of a civil court in examining the order of the municipal committee passed under Punjab Municipal Act The learned judge concluded thus at The remedies given to the subject by a statute are for relief against the exercise of power conferred by a statute but those remedies are not contemplated for usurpation of power under cover of the provisions of the statute To cases of this kind the rule that where a statute creates a right and provides at the same time a remedy that remedy and no other is available has no application The law on the subject may be briefly stated thus Under of the Code of Civil Procedure the <ORG> shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of civil nature excepting suits of which cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred The statute may specifically provide for ousting the jurisdiction of civil <ORG>s even if there was no such specific exclusion if it creates a liability not existing before and gives a special and Particular remedy for the aggrieved party the remedy provided by it must be followed The liability to pay terminal tax is created by the Act and remedy is given to a party aggrieved in the enforcement of that liability Applying one of the principles stated supra the party aggrieved can only pursue the remedy provided by the Act and he cannnot file a suit in a civil Court in that regard There is no force in this contention Section of the Act specifically empowers <ORG> to levy any tax other than those specified therein with the previous sanction of the State Government The Committee has therefore ample power under the Act and the Notification issued by the State Government to impose the said tax We do not see any analogy between these two illustrations in the former the municipal committee does not act under the Act but in the latter it only commits a mistake or an error in fixing the rate of tax payable in respect of a particular commodity one is outside the Act and the other is under the Act one raises the question of jurisdiction and the other raises an objection to a Matter of detail
