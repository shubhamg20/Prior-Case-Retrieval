The appellant who claimed to be the owner of the property in possession filed an objection against attachment on th April before the respondent There is no dispute that the property in dispute belonged to this partnership firm In order to avoid any cloud of title the appellants also filed on th April suit No of on the file of <ORG> at Calcutta for a declaration that the agreement had became void and unenforceable and also for a praying for cancellation of the same The Appellant had also filed an application for an injunction restraining the defendent <ORG> their agents servants and others from in any way dealing with the property or interfering with the rights of the plaintiff appellants The records do not show whether any interim order was given but do show that notice was issued in that application to the defendent There was no need for the claimants to have abdicated their right to recover or forfeit a sum of Rs <ORG> was also of the view that there was no need for paying the additional sum of Rs There was no need for the purchaser to have backed out from the agreement to purchase because the property prices were going up and the vendor would have known that on the date of settlement the property would have fetched much larger money There is absolutely no evidence to show that the appellants owed any sum of money to <ORG> at the time when the agreement to sell was executed or at the time when the agreement was cancelled and the settlement was entered into But it appears from the counter affidavit filed in this Court that a Loan Case No of was pending before the Commissioner <ORG> It appears that that loan case was disposed of by the Commissioner on during the pendency of this appeal and the appellant has also filed that document with an application to receive the same In this order the Commissioner has held that there are absolutely no records to show that any amount was due from Kali Durga Estate to <ORG> and that the said claim of loan of Rs There is no dispute about the notice dated which refers to the agreement to sell and states that building was ready for delivery of possession on or before th November There is nothing on record to show that the purchaser was willing to take possession but it was not handed over The learned Judges seem to be of the view that since the property prices were going up there was no need for the buyer to have agreed for the settlement and that there is a doubt about the settlement itself There is nothing illogical in this attitude of both the vendor and the purchaser settling the matter If the agreement had not fructified into a sale on what basis <ORG> would have become the owner of the property is not made clear in the judgment These points however lose their importance in view of the fact that we are allowing the appeal on the ground that the agreement to sell is not enforceable and had been cancelled This Act itself came into force only on th December In the circumstances we have no doubt that the judgment under appeal is liable to be set aside and accordingly we set aside the same
