Unless the oral application for an adjournment of the hearing of a previous execution petition made by the decree holder on the th August is held to be an application to take a step in aid of execution the present execution application of rd July is clearly barred by limitation there is an obiter dictum showing that an application for adjournment to enable the decree holder to conduct his petition further with effect is not an application to take a step in aid of execution There is nothing in Article of the Limitation Act which requires the application to take some step in aid of execution to be in writing Then as regards the other distinction sought to be made I am unable to see that the application for an adjournment to enable the decree holder to produce affidavit evidence in aid of further proceedings which was the application in <NAME> <NAME> stands on a better footing than an application for an adjournment to enable the decree holder to produce an encumbrance certificate in respect of the attached property in aid of further proceedings in execution I think that there is a fallacy in this reasoning An application by the decree holder to give time to the judgment debtor merely as a matter of grace is a step in retardation In the result I would dismiss the appeal with costs
