Now Section Clause of the Bengal Tenancy Act as it existed before the amendment in ran as follows If the occupancy right in land is transferred to a person jointly interested in the land as proprietor or the permanent tenure holder it shall cease to exist but nothing in this sub section shall prejudicially affect the rights of any third person that there is no law which prevents one of the several co proprietors from holding the status of a tenant under the other co proprietors of land which appertains to the common estate and that the effect of the purchase by one co owner of land of the occupancy right is not that the holding ceases to exist but only the occupancy right which is an incident of the holding According to decision of <ORG> there was nothing in the sub section inconsistent with the continuance of the holding divested of this right of occupancy which attached to it The point again came up for consideration before <ORG> in the case of <NAME> Sheikh Kachu Dec It is suggested that the partition between the co sharer landlord puts an end to the holding but in my judgment there is no foundation for this argument in the Bengal Tenancy Act and we have not been referred to any cases which support the argument put before is by the learned <NAME> on behalf of the respondent In my judgment the view taken by the <ORG> below is incorrect and I would allow the appeal set aside the judgments and decrees of the <ORG> below and dismiss the plaintiff action with costs throughout
