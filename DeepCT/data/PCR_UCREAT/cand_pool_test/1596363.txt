The petitioner then filed a revision under Section of the Act but the same was also dismissed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation Opp The petitioner then filed this writ petition challenging the order of opposite party No A perusal of the order of the Deputy Director of <ORG> of which a copy will be found as Annexure to the writ petition shows that he proceeded to state in the second paragraph of his order the argument that was advanced before him on behalf of the revisionist petitioner by her counsel on the two questions of necessity of obtaining permission of <ORG> and the proof of the fact of gift Then observing that there is considerable force in the arguments of the learned counsel for opposite parties he proceeded to consider only the question whether permission was required and held that it was required There is substance therefore in the argument on the petitioner side that the order would show that the question whether the gift had been proved or not was never considered by the Deputy Director of <ORG> Upon the publication of the notification under Section in the Official Gazette the consequences as hereinafter set forth shall subject to the provisions of this Act from the date specified thereunder till the publication of notification under Section or Sub section of Section as the case may be ensue in the area to which the declaration relates namely notwithstanding anything contained in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act no tenure holder except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall i use his holding or any part thereof for purposes not connected with agriculture horticulture or animal husbandry including pisciculture and poultry farming or ii transfer by way of sale gift or exchange any part of his holding in the consolidation area Provided that a tenure holder may continue to use his holding or any part thereof for any purpose for which it was in use prior to the date specified in the notification issued under Section Two cases have been cited at the bar in this connection He took the view that the prohibition was only against the transfer of part of a holding and not of the whole holding It appears from the report of the case that though the learned Single Judge was aware of the broad proposition that where there is a prohibition against the transfer of a part of the holding it should be construed to mean prohibition against the transfer of the whole holding yet for two reasons he held the said Sub clause ii of Clause to contain a prohibition against transfer of a part of a holding only and not the whole holding The prohibition contained in the sub clause is a restriction upon the fundamental right conferred by Clause of Article of the Constitution of India of course in cases where the nature of the holding carries with it the right of transfer under the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act The meaning to be given to Sub clause ii must be arrived at therefore having regard also to the requirement of keeping the sub clause valid There is no doubt that if it can be shown that the transfer of the whole holding will not create any complications and hindrance in the progress of the consolidation operations then the restriction in regard to transfer of the whole holding would be unjustified and unreasonable and therefore hit by Article read with Article of the Constitution <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner however urged before us that no such contingency would arise as under the meaning given to the expression holding in the Act the whole land held by a tenure holder as a Bhumidhar even though recorded in the Khitauni under different <NAME> would be one holding and therefore if one <NAME> only is transferred it would be a case of a transfer of the part of the holding and not of the whole holding We find there is force in his contention In the Consolidation of Holdings Act certain words and expressions have been defined in Section and thpy include the expressions tenure holder and holding To under stand the implications of this definition reference may first be made to the definition of holding contained in Clause of Section of the Tenancy Act which definition also holds good for the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act by virtue of Clause of Section of that Act We are accordingly of the opinion that with the meaning of holding as clarified above Sub clause ii of Clause of Sub section of Section restricts only the transfer of any part only of the holding of a tenure holder and not the whole holding and in our view the <ORG> case referred to above was correctly decided on the basis of a similar interpretation placed on Sub clause ii of Clause of Sub section i of Section of the Act In the result we allow the writ petition with costs and quash the order of the Deputy Director of Consolidation and direct him to rehear the revision and decide it after considering the question whether the alleged gift has been proved taking it to be the law that no permission of <ORG> was necessary in the case of transfer of the whole Bhumidhari land held by <NAME> in the consolidation area I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by brother <NAME> and though I agree to the order proposed in the writ petition I would wish to add a few words of my own On his death the petitioner filed a petition claiming the four <NAME> exclusively on the basis of an alleged oral gift said to have been made by <NAME> in her favour on October shortly before his death The petitioner filed an appeal before the Settlement Officer <ORG> who confirmed the findings of the <ORG> Officer and dismissed the appeal on February He also argued that there are contradictions in the statements of witnesses with regard to the date of gift and that the oral gift appears to be highly improbable in the face of the circumstance that at the time of alleged oral gift several persons were present who used to do the work of writing documents and were well acquainted with the legal procedure and the deceased had a few years earlier executed a sale deed in favour of the applicant with regard to certain property for the discharge of dower debt and there is no reason why this property also was not given to applicant at that very time There is considerable force in the arguments of the learned counsel for Ps After the above quoted passage the Deputy Director merely dealt with the validity of the gift but did not decide the question as to whether or not one had actually been made unless the decision may be taken to be implied by the use of the words There is considerable force in the arguments of the learned counsel for the opposite parties The petitioner after the dismissal of her revision filed the present writ petition on July The argument advanced at the time of the admission of the writ petition was that the prohibition contained in Section ii of the Act applied to the transfer of a part of the holding without previous permission but it did not apply if the transfer was in respect of the whole holding and reliance for this proposition of law was placed upon All LJ <ORG> admitted the writ petition but was of opinion that the decision in <NAME> case All LJ required reconsideration by a Full Bench and it is in this manner that this petition is before us Section of the Act in so far as it is relevant for the purposes of this petition reads thus Upon the publication of the notification under Sub section of Section in the Official Gazette the consequences as hereinafter set forth shall subject to the provisions of this Act from the date specified thereunder till the publication of notification under Section or Sub section of Section as the case may be ensue in the area to which the notification under Sub section of Section relates namely Notwithstanding anything contained in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act no tenure holder except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall i use his holding or any part thereof for purposes not connected with agriculture horticulture or animal husbandry including pisciculture and poultry farming or ii transfer by way of sale gift or exchange any part of his holding in the consolidation area It was also argued that this <ORG> can only interpret and not legislate and the intention of the <ORG> has to be gathered from the language used In respect of user the ban extends to the entire as also part of the holding as the <ORG> has provided that no tenure holder except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall use his holding or any part thereof except for certain specified purposes And as against this in respect of transfer the <ORG> has provided that no tenure holders except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall transfer by way of sale gift or exchange any part of his holding In short while the ban under Sub clause i extends to the whole and the part the ban under Sub clause ii extends only to the part and not to the whole The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act reads thus After the enforcement of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act there was naturally a pressing demand for the consolidation of holdings in the State AIR SC <ORG> made the following observations The object of the Act is to allot a compact area in lieu of scattered plots to tenure holders so that large scale cultivation may be possible with all its attendant advantages There is saving of time in the management of fields inasmuch as the farmer is saved from travelling from field to field which may be at considerable distances from each other It appears to me that it is because of this that while under Sub clause i the prohibition applies to the entire as well as to the part of a holding under sub Clause ii it extends to a part only because if the whole holding is transferred there can be no fragmentation and the only effect will be the substitution of the transferee in place of the transferor Section of the Act however says that words and expressions not defined in the Act but used or defined in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Act in which they are used or defined Section of the Zamindari Act deals with Classes of tenure The prohibition contained in Section ii of the Act applies to the transfer of a part and not to the transfer of the whole and therefore the permission of the Settlement Officer Consolidation was not necessary In that case there was an agreement between <NAME> and <ORG> for the sale of some plots belonging to <ORG> The argument advanced in that case was that Section A prohibited only sale gift or exchange of one or more plots of a Khata while Kanchhida had transferred the entire Khata and therefore there was no necessity for a permission I am of the view that <NAME> case RD HC involved the interpretation of the repealed Section A which used somewhat different words namely any plot or share in any holding The decision in that case may not be very helpful when the words used in the old section may easily comprise the whole share The utmost that can be said is that it laid down the broad proposition that where there is a prohibition on the transfer of a part it may apply to the transfer of the whole In that view of the matter I think that effect must be given to the words used notwithstanding the broad proposition which may or may not be of universal application On the other hand the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon All LJ The result is that I agree with the order proposed by my brothers <NAME> and <NAME>
