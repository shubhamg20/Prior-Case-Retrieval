The question which we have to determine in this appeal is whether the plaintiff has made out any claim to recover from the defendant the moneys in suit as rent or otherwise But it was neither found by the lower Courts nor has it been contended before us that there was any assignment of the rent to the plaintiff by the dur putnidar It is enough to say that there is no substance in the contention that any assignment of the rent by the assignor to the plaintiff was proved The learned <NAME> further contended that inasmuch as the defendant had paid Rs which was payable as rent under the se putni to the putnidar over a period of years the Court ought to hold that there was an implied contract that the said rent should be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in future The mere payment of a sum of money by A to cannot be made the foundation of a legal obligation on the part of A to pay to a like sum in like circumstances in the future Moreover there was no consideration passing to the defendant from the plaintiff to found any such agreement to the plaintiff that obligation conferred a benefit upon the putnidar which in equity entitled the plaintiff to enforce the obligation against the defendant <NAME> <NAME> added That appears to me to be a principle which is of distinct use in the consideration of this case <ORG>ut these observations of Lord <NAME> must be taken with reference to the context in which they appear and in <NAME>s case Ch A it is clear that <NAME> was treated as holding the sum which he received from the <ORG> under the agreement between himself and the <ORG> as the trustee for the plaintiff that In that case Sir <NAME> appears to have considered that there was a declaration of trust I know of no case where when A simply contracts with <ORG> to pay money to has been held entitled to sue A in equity It appears to me that they are not If were a cestui que trust it would have that effect That rule however is subject to this exception if the contract although in form it is with A is intended to Secure a benefit to <ORG> so that <ORG> is entitled to say he has a beneficial right in cestui que trust under that contract then <ORG> would in a Court of equity be allowed to insist upon and enforce the contract The rule laid down by <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case Ch <NAME> Ch Cas The equitable rule should only be applied in rare cases and under exceptional circumstances and can have no application in a case such as the one under appeal
