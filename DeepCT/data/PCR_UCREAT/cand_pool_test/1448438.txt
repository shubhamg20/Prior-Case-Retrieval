HEADNOTE Acting under the power conferred by section of <ORG>s Act <ORG> Bareilly imposed Circumstances and Property Tax on persons according to their circumstances and property It also provided that where before the appointed date there was in force Circumstances and Property Tax under the Act such tax may continue to be levied by the Zila Parishads at the same rates and on the same conditions under which it was being levied under the Act In appeal to this Court it was contended that the limitation contained in Article of the Constitution cannot be transgressed by the <ORG> by adopting the subterfuge of imposing a consolidated tax by clubbing up two or more entries in List II and that the <ORG> could not exercise the power to levy a tax on circumstances and property by an artificial understanding on that expression so as to acquire power to impose a tax on income a There is a basic distinction between a tax on income and a tax on circumstances and property While income tax can only be levied on income tax on circumstances and property can be on the total turnover of the assessee from his trade or calling or the fact of his having an interest in property The fact that the tax on circumstances and property is levied on the basis of income which an assessee receives from his profession trade calling or property is not conclusive of the nature of the tax Yet the fact that one of the components of the tax namely the component of circumstances is referable to other Entries in addition to Entry should not be construed as conferring an unlimited charter on the local authorities to impose disproportionately excessive levies on the assessees who are subject to their jurisdiction Civil Appeal of is by certificate granted by <ORG> under Articles and of the Constitution while Civil Appeal of is by Special Leave granted by this Court The facts leading to Civil Appeal of are as follows The appellant Acting under the power conferred by section of <ORG>s Act <ORG> Bareilly by Resolution No dated February decided to impose the Circumstances and Property Tax on persons according to their circumstances and property Rule framed under section of the Act for assessment and collection of the said tax was published on March providing for the maximum assessment of Rs Section of that Act provides that where before the appointed date there was in force Circumstances and Property Tax under the District Boards Act such tax may continue to be levied by <ORG> at the same rates and on the same conditions under which it was being levied under the District Boards Act Rule framed under section of the District Boards Act which provides for a maximum levy of Rs The tax was levied by the <ORG> under section of the Town Area Act as amended by the Town Area Validation and Amendment Act which empowers the Town Area <ORG>s to impose a tax on persons according to their circumstances and property not exceeding such rate and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed Being aggrieved by the judgment of <ORG> the appellants have filed this appeal by Special Leave of this Court It was urged before <ORG> that the tax in on circumstances and property was a tax on professions trades callings and employments and therefore the total amount of tax in respect of any one person could not by reason of Article of the Constitution exceed Rs per annum if in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of the Constitution the tax was being imposed the authority which is now seeking to impose the tax being different from the one which was imposing the tax immediately before the Constitution came into force the proviso would have no application Consequently they held that the limitation contained in Art When the Constitution came into force said the learned Judge circumstances and property tax did not find a place in any of the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule and therefore it fell under the residuary entry namely entry of List I which refers to any matter not enumerated in any other entry in List I or in any of the entries in Lists II and III would therefore be attracted but the proviso to that article saved the imposition of the tax even if it was in excess of Rupees two hundred and fifty per annum because the tax was in force in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of the Constitution and the <ORG> had not by law made any provision to the contrary The contention that the Proviso would apply only if the authority imposing the tax after the enactment of the Constitution was the same which did so immediately prior to the Constitution was rejected by the learned Judge on the ground that what was important for the purposes of the Proviso was the identity of the purpose for which the tax was and is imposed and the area of its operation and not the identity of the authority imposing the tax In the companion Appeal of a different consideration arose in a significant respect namely that the tax was not in force in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of the Constitution The assessment having been made by <ORG> under section of the Town Areas Act which was introduced by a post Constitution amendment of the proviso to Art had no application and therefore the levy in excess of Rs It was urged by Mr <NAME> who appears on behalf of the appellant in Civil Appeal No of that although Entry in List II empowers State <ORG> to levy tax on professions trades callings and employments the exercise of that power is necessarily limited by Article of the Constitution Counsel further contended that <ORG> cannot over reach its taxing power by making an artificial definition of words and expressions used in the legislative entries Just as it cannot by an artificial definition of sale of goods exercise a power to legislate in respect of a subject matter outside its sphere it cannot exercise the power to levy a tax on circumstances by an artificial and colourable understanding of that expression so as to acquire the power to impose a tax on income Lastly it was contended by <NAME> and by <NAME> who appears in the companion appeal that the power to levy a tax on circumstances not being incidental to the power to tax professions trades etc the doctrine of pith and substance had no application and could not save the impugned tax on circumstances and property In contrast the relevant consideration in the case of a tax on circumstances and property can be the total turnover of the assessee from his trade or calling or the fact of his having an interest in a property The outgoings the deductions the carry forward losses the development rebate and the like may leave no income in the hands of an assessee which could be brought to tax under the Income tax Act It may be and is often so that the tax on circumstances and property is levied on the basis of income which the assessee receives from his profession trade calling or property One must have regard in such matters as stated by <ORG> in Governor General in <ORG> Province of Madras not to the name of the tax but to its real nature its pith and substance which must determine into what category it falls This Court after referring approvingly to the decision in <ORG> supra particularly to the statement therein that the name given to a tax did not matter and that what had to be considered was the pith and substance of it observed A tax on circumstances and property is a composite tax and the word circumstances means a man financial position his status as a whole depending among other things on his income from trade or business The <ORG> decision under appeal in the instant case <ORG> supra has taken the same view of the nature of the tax on circumstances and property by holding that it is not a tax on income but is a tax on a man financial position his status as a whole depending upon his income from trade or business The reason for such an inquiry is mainly two fold firstly even if the tax on circumstances is within the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature being referable to entry of List II which relates to taxes on professions trades callings and employments it cannot exceed the limit of two hundred and fifty rupees per annum prescribed by Article of the Constitution unless the proviso to that article is attracted secondly if the tax is beyond the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature being a composite tax not liable to be split up into distinct component parts it will be necessary to examine whether the tax is saved by article of the Constitution The proviso to this clause says that if in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of this Constitution there was in force in the case of any <ORG> or any such municipality board or authority a tax on professions trades callings or employments the rate or the maximum rate of which exceeded two hundred and fifty rupees per annum such tax may continue to be levied until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law and any law so made by <ORG> may be made either generally or in relation to any specified <ORG>s municipalities boards or authorities Entry of List II Seventh Schedule relates to taxes on lands and buildings while Entry of the same list relates to taxes on professions trades callings and employments After a careful examination of the nature of the tax the learned Judge summed up the position thus To sum up the history of the tax on circumstances and property after definitely shows that it was not a distinct and separate impost In coming to this conclusion reliance was placed by the learned Judge on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> supra and that of <ORG> in <ORG> supra It did not say as <NAME> <NAME> said in <ORG> decision in the Zila Parishad Muzaffarnagar supra that the tax on circumstances and property is referable only to two entries in List II namely Entries and According to <ORG> the tax was wide enough to cover certain other items in List II like Item which relates to taxes on animals and boats The fact that one of the components of the impugned tax namely the component of circumstances is referable to other entries in addition to Entry should not be construed as conferring an unlimited charter on the local authorities to impose disproportionately excessive levies on the assessees who are subject to their jurisdiction An excessive levy on circumstances will tend to blur the distinction between a tax on income and a tax on circumstances Income will then cease to be a mere measure or yardstick of the tax and will become the very subject matter of the tax All that remains to be done is to express our inability to accept as correct the view taken by Mr Justice <NAME> and Mr Justice <NAME> in <ORG> supra that by reason of the fact that the circumstances and property tax is a composite tax and since the element of property necessarily enters into that composition the tax cannot be identified as a tax on professions trades callings or employments We may also mention that in so far as <ORG> are concerned Article will not save the impugned tax since it was levied by <ORG> in pursuance of the power conferred by clause of section of the Town Areas Act which was introduced by a post Constitution amendment For these reasons we uphold the validity of the tax on circumstances and property in both the appeals and dismiss the appeals with costs
