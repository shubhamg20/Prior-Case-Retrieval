can only save the levy of a tax that was being lawfully levied by a <ORG> immediately before the commencement of the Constitution and that as the Act came into force only after the Constitution the levy made thereunder does riot satisfy the condition laid down by the Article saved the levy of a tax under the Act there was an agreement between the President of India and the Raj pramukh of tile <ORG> of Travancore Cochin and under the said agreement the <ORG> agreed to recoup the loss in revenue incurred by the said <ORG> by reason of the constitutional transference of the <ORG> power of taxation in respect of certain items to the <ORG> List and that thereafter the <ORG> ceased to have the power to levy any tax in respect of the subjects so transferred is that to the extent covered by an agreement the power of the <ORG> Government to continue to levy taxes under Art The said amendment was only prospective in operation and it could not have affected the validity of the agreement Article operates in its own sphere in spite of Art In either view the result is the same namely that at any rate during the period covered by the agreement the <ORG>s ceased to have any power to impose the tax in respect of works contracts The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> four companion appeals arise out of a common judgment of <ORG> dismissing the four petitions filed by the appellant seeking to quash the orders of assessment made by the Sales Tax authorities imposing sales tax in respect of works contracts It carries on business in iron hardware electrical goods timber coir engineering contracts etc Likewise the nd respondent assessed the Com pany to sales tax by his orders dated and for the assessment years and in respect of works contracts The appellant filed four petitions in <ORG> under Arts The main contention advanced on behalf of the appellant Company before <ORG> was that after the Constitution came into force the relevant Sales Tax Act imposing sales tax on works contracts were uncons titutional and therefore void The Act was publi shed in the <ORG> on January but thereof provided that it would come into force on such date as the Government might by notification in the <ORG> appoint The new Act practically contained the provisions of the earlier Act The said Act came into force on October applied the said provision could not be relied upon by the appellant in view of the agreement entered into between the <ORG> of Travancore and <ORG> under Art It may be mentioned at this stage that the learned Advocate General conceded that the assessment orders for the years and made under the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Amendment Act of and the Kerala Surcharge on Taxes Act were bad but prayed that the State might be given liberty to assess the appellant de novo for the said years under the Act of the Constitution can only save the levy of a tax that was being lawfully levied by a State immediately before the commencement of the Constitution and that as the Act came into force only after the Constitution the levy made thereunder does not satisfy the condition laid down by the article saved the levy of tax under the Act the further contention of the appellant is that there was an agreement dated February between the President of India and the Rajpramukh of the <ORG> of Travancore Cochin in the matter of the federal financial integration in the said <ORG> and that under the said agreement the <ORG> agreed to recoup the loss in revenue incurred by the said <ORG> by reason of the constitutional transference of the <ORG> power of taxation in respect of certain items to the <ORG> List and that thereafter the <ORG> ceased to have the power to levy tax in respect of the subjects so transferred the <ORG> would continue to have the power to levy the tax in respect of works contracts till <ORG> made appropriate law it did not incur any loss in respect of the said tax and therefore no valid agreement could be entered into between the <ORG> Government and the <ORG> in respect thereof does not come into play unless <ORG> acquires the power to levy a particular tax saved by Art by <ORG> making an appropriate law for it is said with some force there cannot be an agreement to recoup any loss of revenue when there is no such loss That section had effect only from April and did not apply to arrears of duty of excise in regard to the earlier period The learned Chief Justice proceeded to state thus at That a duty of the kind now in controversy on the date of the agreement after coming into force of the Constitution is leviable only by the Government of India even in respect of the State of Rajasthan is clear beyond all doubt This Court therefore held that after the coming into force of the Constitution the excise duty in question in that case was leviable only by the Government of India though there was a saving provision in favour of the <ORG> of Rajasthan till <ORG> made an appropriate law and on that rea soning it held that the agreement under Art The only difference between that case and the present one is that at the time the agreement was entered into between the <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG> had not made the appropriate law depriving the <ORG> of its power to levy taxes in respect of <ORG> contracts But that cannot make any difference in principle for even the earlier decision related only to the validity of the agreement in respect of arrears leviable by the <ORG> before the appropriate law was made is that to the extent covered by an agreement the power of the <ORG> Government to continue to levy taxes under Art The next question is whether there was any such agreement where under the <ORG> agreed to give up its right to levy the said tax as a part of the agreement entered into by it with the <ORG> This leads us to consider the terms of the agreement dated February entered into between the President of India and the Rajpramukh of the <ORG> of Travancore Cochin A perusal of the main recommendations made by the Indian <ORG>s Finance Enquiry <ORG> and incorporated in the agreement also indicates the completeness of the agreement In Ch of Part II which dealt with Specific matter concerning Federal revenues and Federal service departments it was stated that with effect from the prescribed date the <ORG> will take over all federal sources of <ORG> and all federal items of expenditure in <ORG>s together with the administration of the Departments concerned and that the <ORG> must also take over all the current outstandings liabilities claims etc It takes into consideration the entire loss caused to the <ORG> by reason of some of its sources of revenue being transferred under the Constitution to the <ORG> As we have said that saving was subject to an agreement and as by the agreement effective adjustments were made to meet the loss which the <ORG> would have incurred but for the agreement there was no longer any necessity for the continuance of the saving and it ceased to have any force thereafter between the parties to the agreement We are not called upon in this case to decide whether the said power revived after the expiry of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution for all the impugned assessments fall within the said period Nor do we find any force in the contention that as Art was omitted by the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act the agreement entered into in exercise of a power thereunder automatically came to an end and thereafter the power of the <ORG> to levy the tax came into life again An obvious fallacy underlies this ingenious argument Article conferred a power upon the <ORG> and the <ORG> to enter into an agreement which would continue in force for a period not exceeding ten years from the commencement of the Constitution The said amendment was only prospective in operation and it could not have affected the validity of the agreement Learned Advocatc General for the <ORG> of Kerala raises an interesting point namely that the impugned law i the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Act of continued in force after the Constitution under the express provisions of Art thereof till the said law was altered repealed or amended by the competent authority and therefore even if there was an agreement between the <ORG> and the <ORG> as aforesaid it could not affect the power of the <ORG> to impose the tax under the said law Article reads Notwithstanding the repeal by this Constitution of the enactments referred to in article but subject to the other provisions of this Constitution all the law in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall continue in force therein until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority Explanation I The expression law in force in this article shall include a law passed or made by a <ORG> or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed notwithstanding that it or parts of it may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas The object of this article is to maintain the continuity of the pre existing laws after the Constitution came into force till they were repealed altered or amended by a competent authority The words subject to the other provisions of the Constitution should therefore be given a reasonable interpretation an interpretation which would carry out the intention of the makers of the Constitution and also which is in accord with the constitutional practice in such matters The article posits the continuation of the pre existing laws made by a competent authority notwithstanding the repeal of certain acts under Art They held that a law made by a competent authority before the Constitution continues to be in force after the Constitution till it is altered or modified or repealed by the appropriate authority even though it is beyond the legislative competence of the said authority under the Constitution The words subject to other provisions of the Constitution mean that if there is an irreconcilable conflict between the pre existing law and provision or provisions of the Constitution the latter shall prevail to the extent of that inconsistency of our Constitution which deals with different situation and lays down expressly the legal position to meet the same We would therefore confine our attention to the express pro visions of the Constitution in considering the question rai sed before us The relevant provisions which have a bearing on the said question arc found in Part XII of the Constitution But before the Constitution came into force the States were levying and collecting certain taxes which under the Constitution were allotted to the <ORG> With this background let us now consider the following two questions raised before us Whether Art It is settled law that a special provision should be given effect to the extent of its scope leaving the general provision to control cases where the special provision does not apply The earlier discussion makes it abundantly clear that the Constitution gives a separate treatment to the subject of finance and Art continues the pre Constitution laws of taxation that provision is expressly made subject to the other provisions of the Constitution The expression subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding India place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject In either view the result is the same namely that at any rate during the period covered by the agreement the States ceased to have any power to impose the tax in respect of works contracts In the result the said orders of assessment are set aside and the appeals are allowed with costs here and in <ORG>
