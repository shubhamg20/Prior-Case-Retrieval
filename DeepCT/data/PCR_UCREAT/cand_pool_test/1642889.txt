Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the assessed business of printing and publishing books was a newly established industrial undertaking entitled to the exemption from tax under section of the Income tax Act The facts relevant to the first question may briefly be stated <ORG> Delhi hereinafter referred to as the assessed is a registered firm carrying on business of publishing books The assessed did obtain recognition for its text books through the good offices of <ORG> and it paid to <ORG> a sum of during the accounting period relevant to the assessment year The assessed claimed deduction of the said amount in computing its income for the said year The question however arises for consideration where expenditure is incurred while the business is going on and is not incurred either for extension of the business or for the substantial replacement of its equipment If on the other hand it is made not for the purpose of bringing into existence any such asset or advantage but for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profits it is a revenue expenditure The aim and object of the expenditure would determine the character of the expenditure whether it is a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure Although these principles are well settled the difficulty arises in the application of such principles to the facts and circumstances of each case Each case must depend on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect But we shall proceed on the basis of what is stated in the appellate order of the <ORG> and in the statement of the case and assume that the <ORG> had installed a new printing press for the first time in this year only and that the <ORG> printed its books in its own printing press We find considerable force in this contention Does it make any difference that the new company or resuscitated company does or does not take over the liabilities I think not I think it is none the less a reconstruction because from the assets taken over some part is excepted provided that substantially the business is taken and it is immaterial whether the liabilities are taken over by the new or resuscitated company or are provided for by excepting from the scheme of reconstruction a sufficient amount to answer them You have to see whether substantially the same persons carry on the same business and if they do that is a reconstruction If looking at the substance of the transaction it is a sale then the concept of reconstruction must be ruled out for in such a case there is no scope for speaking about any reconstruction of an existing business The only change that took place in the present year is that instead of getting its books printed in some other press it printed its books in its own press It is significant that the word used in clause i of sub section of section of the Act is business and not industrial undertaking We therefore answer the second question also in the negative i against the assessed and in favor of the <ORG>
