This appeal arises from the judgment of <ORG> of Allahabad High Court made on December in CMWP No of <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant contended that since declaration was not published immediately the exercise of power under Section dispensing with the inquiry under Section A is bad in law as it indicates that there was no real urgency The view of <ORG> that possession of land is deemed to have been taken under Section is not correct on the facts of this case has no application to the facts of this case though we are in agreement with the learned counsel in this behalf we do not find substance in the other contentions When the <ORG> forms an opinion that the lands are urgently needed for a public purpose notification under Section could be issued and published in the <ORG> while dispensing with inquiry under Section A Giving a gap of one day the declaration under Section of the Act could be published in the <ORG> The land stands vested in the State under Section read with Section free from all encumbrances The appellant filed the writ petition on July and consequently possession could not be taken In that behalf in the counter affidavit filed in <ORG> it was stated that the notification was withdrawn in respect thereof since those lands were required to be taken possession of under the Land Ceiling Act and therefore there was no need to acquire those lands Under those circumstances we think that there is no justification to quash the declaration under Section and to give direction to conduct an inquiry under Section A Instead it is contended by <NAME> that the standing crops and the structures are required to be removed and that the appellants are prepared to cut and carry away the standing crops after they are harvested <NAME> undertakes to give the Khasra numbers and the extent of the land in which there are standing crops
