In order to appreciate the contentions raised by the petitioners it is necessary to refer to the facts of this petition which lie within a narrow compass The petitioners are a Company carrying on the business of manufacturing and supplying diverse kinds of stationery articles including inter alia carbon papers typewriter ribbons and teleprinter rolls at their factory at Pokhran Road Thane West Therefore the petitioners contend that all that is done by them is to cut large or Jumbo size paper into a specified size and roll the same to a specified dimension and no change whatsoever takes place to the Jumbo or large size rolls of writing or printing paper purchased by the petitioners and the paper in the teleprinter rolls is identical in every respect to the writing or printing paper purchased by them It is further contended by the petitioners that the activity carried on by them cannot be regarded as an activity pertaining to manufacturing of paper or an activity incidental or ancillary to the completion of paper as a manufacturing product On th April the petitioners submitted under protest to the Assistant Collector of <ORG> for classification of all the goods manufactured by the petitioners as required under the provisions of Rule of the <ORG> Rules The petitioners being aggrieved by the said order of the Assistant Collector of <ORG> that all teleprinter rolls would attract excise duty filed an appeal therefrom on or about th August before the Appellate Collector of <ORG> The aggregate amount of excise duty payable thereon came to Rs The appeal filed before the Appellate Collector of <ORG> and Customs came to be rejected on Firstly it was contended by the respondents in the proceedings before <ORG> that teleprinter rolls were not identical to printing or writing paper The process of cutting large rolls of paper into specific sizes and dimensions and to roll them into teleprinter rolls interleaved with carbon papers with the aid of power driven machines amounts to manufacture of paper within the meaning of Section of the Central Excises Salt Act It was also contended on their behalf that if such large rolls of paper are not subjected to the above manufacturing process they cannot be used as teleprinter paper and hence cannot be called as teleprinter rolls The respondents therefore have taken the stand that the process was one of manufacturing teleprinter paper The petitioners have further sought for direction to be issued to respondents to withdraw the orders passed by the respondents dated th July th October and th April refusing the proforma credit on tissue paper used by the petitioners in manufacturing carbon paper which in turn was used for making teleprinter paper rolls and the petitioners also pray for a writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ direction or order under Article of the Constitution of India directing the respondents to refund the amount of Rs While there were others who were manufacturing the teleprinter rolls tapes by converting duty paid paper and clearing such teleprinter rolls tapes on payment of duty However subsequently a new rule that is Rule A of the Central Excise Rules was inserted in the Central Excise Rules and by virtue of Notification No CE dated a statutory provision of law to allow credit on duty paid on raw materials component parts and finished goods brought from outside the factory for use in the further manufacture of assessable goods was made applicable to the product paper falling under Item No of the Central Excise Tariff PAPER all sorts including paste board millboard strawboard and cardboard in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power Cigarette tissue Three Rupees per kilogram All the above operations are carried out by power driven machines and the question which falls for determination now is whether the finished product which is so produced or manufactured is out of the very base material that is the printing and writing paper <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners has vehemently argued that while what was purchased as duty paid printing and writing paper the petitioners only made out of it teleprinter rolls and they did not manufacture paper as such In order to appreciate the rival submissions and contentions of the parties it becomes necessary to examine few provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act Item No is already quoted above and it is clear from the same that paper of all sorts including pasteboard millboard strawboard and cardboard in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power refers in sub item to teleprinter that is teleprinter paper As per the provisions of section which is the charging section under the Act there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed the duties of excise on all excisable goods other than sale which are produced or manufactured in India It is therefore clear that duties under this charging section can be levied on all excisable goods produced or manufactured in India Section of the Act provides certain operations to be subject to licence and the said section empowers <ORG> may by Notification in the Official Gazette provide that from such date as may be specified in the notification no person shall except under the authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence granted under this Act engage in a the production or manufacture or any process of the production or manufacture of any specified goods included in the First Schedule The Rule making power has been conferred on <ORG> by section of the Act and <ORG> may make rules to carry into effect the purposes of this Act Under Item No of the First Schedule of the Central Excise Tariff paper of all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power is subject to levy of excise duty at different rates depending upon the type of paper Since there is no manufacture of paper taking place attracting duty under Tariff Item No there is no question of taking out a licence under the Central Excise Law under the said Tariff Item namely Item All that was done was mere application of gum on one side of the paper and it was hold that what they had done did not convert that paper into a new commodity known to the market as such In the facts of that case therefore <ORG> of Gujarat High Court came to the conclusion that the intermediate product of what the revenue calls gummed paper is not gummed paper known to the market as such and mere application of gum on one side of paper does not convert that paper into a new commodity known to the market as such What is important to bear in mind is the clear observation of <ORG> that the end product was not known in the market as such and the process of applying gum did not convert the original paper into a new commodity known to the market This decision in our view does not advance the case of the petitioners any further to pursuade us to hold that what is produced by them is not a different and distinct commodity known to the market having a distinctive name characteristics and usage Elaborate processes as in our case of cutting the paper to various demensions as required by the customers thereafter interleafing them with carbon papers and all these processes being carried out with the aid of power driven machines were not undertaken nor did the end product having a distinct and special form and size and also having a special usage and marketability emerge No processes whatsoever were carried out with the aid of power driven machines and the end product remained paper The identity of the original writing or printing paper is wholly lost and it becomes a separate and distinct commodity known in the market The question raised in that case was whether Pineapple fruit Conversion into pineapple slices for sale in sealed cans amounts to manufacture <ORG> rejected the case of the petitioners and held that When the pineapple fruit is processed into pineapple slices for the purpose of being sold in sealed cans there is no consumption of the original pineapple fruit for the purpose of manufacture Although the nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another yet it is only when the change or a series of changes taken the commodity to the point where commercially it is recognised as a new and distinct article that a manufacture can be said to have taken place If there is no essential difference in the identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that one commodity has been consumed in the manufacture of another even though it has undergone a degree of processing Their Lordships of <ORG> in that case referred to a number of authorities and after examining all of them referred to the American decision in <ORG> United States reported in Ed which throws more light on the word manufacture The word manufacture implied a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change in an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary There must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character and use The commodity or article that is teleprinter paper or teleprinter roll is well known in the market and is known as a distinct commodity and as such meanings given to articles in a fiscal statute must be as people in trade and commerce conversant with the subject generally treat and understand them in usual course There is however a basic and initial difficulty in the way of the petitioners which seems to us to be insurmountable Technical and scientific tests offer guidance only within limits Once the articles are in circulation and come to be described and known in common parlance then there is no difficulty for statutory classification under a particular entry The <ORG> in its wisdom however treated paper in relation to manufacture of which and process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power driven machines and specified teleprinter paper in sub item of Tariff Item No as a distinct entry and it is difficult to accept all the persuasive arguments and submissions made before us by the learned Counsel for the petitioners to treat teleprinter paper as falling under sub item of Tariff Item No Once the <ORG> has chosen to place teleprinter paper as a special entry over riding the general entry in sub item of Tariff Item No as mentioned in the First Schedule of the Central Excise Tariff in our opinion there is little scope left for us to determine under which item it will fall <NAME> the learned Counsel for the petitioners fairly conceded before us that there is no averment in the petition challenging the validity of entry i teleprinter paper should fall under entry and not under entry Needless to say that we have come to the conclusion that teleprinter paper rolls are only a different name for teleprinter paper XX where it was held that the onus of proving that the assessee was carrying on business and was therefore a dealer within the meaning of section of the Central Sales Tax Act was on the department and that the department has discharged that onus where the word manufacture occurring in section come for interpretation In view of that judgment reference was made to the two well known cases on the interpretation of the word manufacture viz There is no difficulty in accepting the proposition that the burden is on the department of proving that the petitioners were manufacturing paper when preparing or making teleprinter rolls or paper We therefore reject the arguments of the petitioners and hold that teleprinter paper and or teleprinter rolls is covered by sub item of Tariff Item No as mentioned in the First Schedule of the Central Excise Tariff The proviso to Rule A provides that no credit of duty shall be allowed in respect of any material or component parts used in the manufacture of finished excisable goods i if such finished excisable goods produced by the manufacturer are exempt from the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon or are chargeable to nil rate of duty and ii unless a duty has been paid for such material or component parts under the same item as the finished excisable goods or remission or adjustment of duty paid for such material or component parts has been specifically sanctioned by the Central Government What is pertinent and important to note as far as this submission of the Counsel for the petitioners is concerned is that there was no duty leviable on carbon paper itself According to the submission there is nothing in Rule A to warrant the proposition that raw material or component parts must be directly used and the raw material or component parts cannot be converted into an intermediary product before being used in the finished product The submission is that first tissue paper is purchased by the petitioners and then it is converted into carbon paper which is ultimately used in the finished product that is teleprinter paper rolls It has also been held in that case that Carbon paper is not paper covered by expression paper other than hand paper in Item of the Notification and cannot be taxed thereunder The word paper in the common parlance or in the commercial sense means paper which is used for printing writing or packing purposes It is an independent product which was exempted at the relevant time from the levy of excise duty Paper and paper board all sorts including paste board mill board straw board card board and corrugated board in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power Uncoated and coated printing and Twenty five per writing paper other than poster cent ad valorem In that case the petitioners were a private limited company carrying on the business of manufacture and sale of paints and varnishes at Kanpur The petitioners were permitted to avail of proforma credit on materials used in the manufacture of pains and varnishes but they did not possess any such permission for synthetic resin for the manufacture of which the party held a separate licence The party therefore had no right to avail of proforma credit on the processed Oil used in the manufacture of synthetic resin In that case there was no finding that Alkyd Resin was removed from the place where it was produced for consumption export of manufacture of any other commodity Duty is paid first on the tissue paper and then it is converted into an intermediary product and afterwards the intermediary product carbon paper is used in the manufacture of teleprinter rolls or teleprinter paper and thereafter the petitioners are entitled to proforma credit on duty paid on tissue paper The observations of <ORG> in <ORG> case that the fact therefore that the substance produced by the manufacturer at the intermediary stage is not put in the market would not make any difference to the chargeability of the substance to excise duty if it is covered by any item in Schedule I of the Act has no application to the facts of the present case We do not see anything wrong in the reasoning given by either of the lower authorities including the decision of <ORG> dated at Ex In the view we have taken both the contentions of the petitioners fail and therefore the petition is dismissed with costs
