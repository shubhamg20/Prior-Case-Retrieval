HEADNOTE The respondents brought a suit for a mandatory injunction directing the removal of certain masonry structure on suit site and for a permanent injunction restraining the appellants from encroaching upon the suit property and from causing obstruction to the right of way of the residents of the village They claimed that the suit property formed part of a public street and the appellants had no right to encroach upon it On appeal the learned Subordinate Judge set aside the decree On challenge of this decree by the respondents in second appeal before <ORG> the learned single Judge passed a decree in their favour All that the learned Judge stated in his judgment was that after a careful consideration of all the issues that arise for decision in this second appeal I am of the opinion that the best form in which a decree could be given to the plaintiffs is in the following terms and then he proceeded to set out the terms of his decree The respondents raised a preliminary objection that since the appellants did not avail themselves of the remedy available to them under the Letters Patent of <ORG> either the special Leave granted by this <ORG> should be revoked or the appeal should be dismissed Held It would not be possible to lay down an unqualified rule that special leave should not be granted if the party has not moved for leave under the Letters Patent and it cannot be so granted nor is it possible to lay down an inflexible rule that if in such a case special leave has been granted it must always and necessarily be revoked it is not possible and indeed it would not be expedient to lay down any general rule which would govern all cases should be exercised or not and if yes on what terms and conditions is a matter which this <ORG> has to decide on the facts of each case In the present case the learned Judge passed an order which reads more like an award made by an arbitrator who by terms of his reference is not under an obligation to give reasons for his conclusions embodied in the award The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR This appeal by Special leave raises a short question about the correctness propriety and legality of the decree passed by <ORG> in second appeal No The respondents had sued the appellants in <ORG> for a mandatory injunction directing the removal of certain masonry structure standing on the suit site which was marked as A in the plan attached to the plaint and for a permanent injunction restraining the appellants from building upon or otherwise encroaching upon the suit property and from causing obstruction to the right of way of the residents of the village in which the suit property was situated According to the respondents the plot on which encroachment had been caused by the construction of the masonry structure by the appellants was a street and the reliefs they claimed were on the basis that the said property formed part of a public street and the appellants had no right to encroach upon it This suit had been instituted by the respondents in a representative capacity on behalf of themselves and other residents in the locality <NAME> who heard this appeal passed a decree which is challenged before us by the appellants in the present appeal All that the learned Judge has done in his judgment is to state that after a careful consideration of all the issues that arise for decision in this Second Appeal am of the opinion that the best form in which a decree could be given to the plaintiffs is in the following terms and then the learned Judge has proceeded to set out the terms of his decree in clauses the rd clause being sub divided into clauses a As to the costs the learned Judge directed that parties should bear their own costs throughout Before dealing with this contention however it is neces sary to refer to a preliminary objection raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondents He contends that it was open to the appellants to apply for leave to file a Letters Patent appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge and since the appellants have not adopted that course it is not open to them to come to this Court by special leave He has therefore argued that either the leave granted by this Court to the appellants should be revoked or the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that this was not a matter in which this Court will interfere having regard to the fact that a remedy available to the appellant under the Letters Patent of <ORG> has not been availed of by them In that case this <ORG> allowed an appeal preferred against a second appellate decision of <ORG> on the ground that the said impugned decision had interfered with a finding of fact contrary to the provisions of section of the Civil Procedure Code It appears that a preliminary objection had been raised in that case by the respondents similar to the one which is raised in the present appeal and in rejecting that preliminary objection this <ORG> observed that since leave has been ranted we do not think we can or should virtually revoke the leave by accepting the preliminary objection On several occasions this <ORG> has revoked special leave when facts were brought to its notice to justify the adoption of that course and so we do not think Mr <NAME> is justified in contending that leave granted to the appellants under Art There is no doubt that if a party wants to avail himself of the remedy provided by Art in cases where the decree of <ORG> under appeal has been passed under it is necessary that the party must apply for leave under the Letters Patent if the relevant clause of the Letters Patent provides for an appeal to <ORG> against the decision of a single Judge expressly provides that normally an appeal will not lie to this <ORG> from the judgment decree or final order of one Judge of <ORG> It is only where an application for special leave against a second appellate judgment raises issues of law of general importance that the <ORG> would grant the application and proceed to deal with the merits of the contentions raised by the appellant Even so we do not think it would be possible to lay down an unqualified rule that leave should not be granted if the party has not moved for leave under the Letters Patent and it cannot be so granted nor is it possible to lay down an inflexible rule that if in such a case leave has been granted it must always and necessarily be revoked it is not possible and indeed it would not be expedient to lay down any general rule which would govern all cases should be exercised or not and if yes on what terms and conditions is a matter which this <ORG> has to decide on the facts of each case In dealing with the respondents contention that the special leave granted to the appellant against a second appellate decision should be revoked on the ground that the appellant had not applied for leave under the relevant clause of the Letters Patent it is necessary to bear in mind one relevant fact If however the caveator does not appear or having appeared does not raise this point or even if he raises the point the <ORG> does not decide it before granting special leave the same point can be raised at the time of final hearing Reverting then to the main point raised by the appellants in this appeal we do not think we would be justified in refus ing to deal with the merits of the appeal solely on the round that the appellants did not move the learned single Judge for leave to prefer an appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> In the present case the learned Judge has passed an order which reads more like an award made by an arbitrator who by terms of his reference is not under an obligation to give reasons for his conclusions embodied in the award The result is the appeal is allowed the decree passed by <ORG> is set aside and second appeal No of is sent back to <ORG> with a direction that it should be dealt with in accordance with law
