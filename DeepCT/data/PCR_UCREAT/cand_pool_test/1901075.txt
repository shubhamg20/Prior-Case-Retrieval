The tax payer has the option not to make the deposit but in that case he has to pay tax on his total income and fifty per cent of the amount saved by not making the deposit The petitioner challenged the validity of the annuity deposit scheme on the grounds that i the <ORG> was not competent to incorporate in the Income tax Act a provision which was substantially one related to borrowings by <ORG> from a class of tax payers ii enactment of Ch XXII A was a colourable exercise of legislative power and the provisions thereof were so harsh and unconscionable that they wore expropriatory and hence not within the legislative competence of the <ORG> and iii and Sch The Indian Income tax Act and the provisions of the annual Finance Act of <ORG> which authorise levy of income tax at the rates prescribed thereby are undoubtedly enacted in exercise of the powers conferred by entry in List I Granting that the scheme of Ch XXII A is for borrowing money by <ORG> from the tax payers in the higher income group which is repayable in instalments power to legislate in that behalf is still within the competence of <ORG> by virtue of Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule If <ORG> has the power to legislate for collecting annuity deposits from tax payers there is nothing in the Constitution which disentitles <ORG> as a matter of legislative arrangement to incorporate the provisions relating to borrowing from tax payers in the Income tax Act or any other statute There is no probibition against <ORG> enacting in a single statute matters which call for the exercise of power under two or more entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule The doctrine of colourable legislation therefore can have no application where <ORG> is invested with the authority to legislate in respect of annuity deposit and it exercises that power iii The exemption of persons who have attained the age of seventy years from liability to pay additional tax cannot be said to be discriminatory against tax payers below the age of seventy years who have exercised the option The classification is prima facie reasonable and there is nothing to show that it had no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by <ORG> Entry conferring residuary powers can only be invoked when there is no other entry in any of the three Lists under which the impugned legislation could come The petitioner has filed this petition challenging the validity of the demand on the plea that Ch XXII A of the Income tax Act is unconstitutional and is otherwise violative of the fundamental right guaranteed by Art The Act came into force on April Section defines amongst other expressions adjusted total income a percentage of which is by the Second Schedule liable to be deposited as annuity deposit The amount of annuity deposit payable by a taxpayer in any year is admissible as a deduction in computing his total income charged to tax for that year If the adjusted total income of an assessee includes income chargeable to income tax under the head salaries allowance has to be made in computing the income under that head and if there be no income under that head or the annuity deposit required to be made exceeds the salary income the whole of the balance of the annuity deposit is allowable as a deduction in computing the total earned income the nature of commission which forms part of his adjusted total income may defer making advance deposit when commission is receivable periodically and is not received or adjusted by the payer in the depositor account The petitioner submits that the scheme of annuity deposit incorporated in Ch XXII A is invalid because a the <ORG> had no competence to incorporate in the Indian Income tax Act a provision which was substantially one relating to borrowings by <ORG> from a class of taxpayers the provisions contained in Ch XXII A are enacted in colourable exercise of legislative power and that in any event they are so harsh and unconscionable that they may be regarded as expropriatory and on that account not within the legislative competence of the <ORG> and the provisions of and Sch In our view there is no substance in any of the contentions read with Entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule power to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income The Indian Income tax Act and the provisions of the annual Finance Act of the <ORG> which authorise levy of income tax at the rates prescribed thereby are undoubtedly enacted in exercise of the powers conferred by Entry in List I Granting that the scheme of Ch XXII A is for borrowing money by <ORG> from the taxpayers in the higher income group at the rates prescribed which is repayable in instalments power to legislate in that behalf is still within the competence of the <ORG> by virtue of Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule But if the <ORG> has the power to legislate for collecting annuity deposits from taxpayers there is nothing in the Constitution which disentitles the <ORG> as a matter of legislative arrangement to incorporate the provisions relating to borrowing from taxpayers in the Income tax Act or any other statute There is no prohibition against the <ORG> enacting in a single sta tute matters which call for the exercise of power under two or more entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule Illustrations of such legislation are not wanting in our statute book and the fact that one of such entries is the residuary entry does not Also attract any disability The <ORG> did enact the Compulsory Deposit Scheme Act as a separate statute but that does not mean that it had no power to incorporate it within the Income tax Act if the <ORG> so desired The annuity deposit is based on the total income of the taxpayer if the taxpayer pays the deposit he is entitled to deduction of the amount in the computation of income tax and if he exercises the option not to pay the deposit he is rendered liable to Day additional income tax The argument that Ch XXII A is a colourable exercise of legislative power has no substance statute is constitutional or not is question of power if the Constitution of a State distributes the legislative powers amongst different bodies which have to act within their respective spheres marked out by specific legislative entries or if there are limitations on the legislative authority in the shape of fundamental rights questions do arise as to whether the legislature in a particular case has or has not in respect of the subject matter of the statute or in the method of enacting it transgressed the limits of its constitutional powers If the <ORG> has the power to enact legislation for levying assessing and collecting annuity deposits and for repayment in annual instalments by enacting that legislation the <ORG> does not trespass upon powers outside its domain The doctrine of colourable legislation therefore can have no application where the <ORG> is invested with the authority to legislate in respect of annuity deposit and it exercises that power Article of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws The <ORG> has been of the view that persons who have an income exceeding Rs There is undoubtedly a distinction made between persons who are below the age of seventy years on the last day of the previous year and those who have attained that age the former on exercising the option not to pay annuity deposits will have to pay tax on the total income and additional income tax the latter will only pay tax on total income but not additional income tax The <ORG> is apparently of the view having regard to the life span in our country capacity to engage in gainful employment and other relevant circumstances that the latter should be exempted from payment of additional tax It is difficult to regard the provision exempting this class of persons from liability to pay additional tax as depriving other taxpayers below the age of seventy who have exercised the option under of the guarantee of equal protection of the laws <NAME> I agree that this petition should be dismissed with costs Before recourse can be had to entry No it must be found as a fact that there is no entry in any of the three Lists under which the impugned legislation can come No doubt the provisions for the management of the annuity deposits deal with matters slightly out of place in a pure taxing measure but our Constitution has not created a water tight compartment as is to be found in the Commonwealth of Australia Act A similar power is granted to the <ORG> of the State by Art There is no entry in List which can be said to take in the law relating to Annuity Deposits As the subject of the annuity deposit provisions is capable of being comprehended in the entry relating to taxes on income do not feel called upon to invoke the aid of entry No by assuming that no entry covers such provisions I agree therefore that the petition be dismissed with costs
