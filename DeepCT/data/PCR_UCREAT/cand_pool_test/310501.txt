HEADNOTE Under Section A of the Indian income Tax Act if in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends within the months immediately following the expiry of that previous year are less than the statutory percentage of the total income of that previous year as reduced by the amounts mentioned in cls a and and sub the Income Tax Officer shall make an order that the company shall be liable to pay super tax at the prescribed rate on the undistributed balance of the total income of the previous year The income Tax Officer allocated the dividends declared by the company to the industrial and non industrial segments in the same proportion as the profits of the two segments bore to the total profits of the company and levied additional super tax under A on the entire undistributed balance of the total profits available for distribution namely Rs On this allocation it came to the conclusion that the company having declared the statutory dividend on its industrial profits was not liable to pay additional super tax in so far as these profits were concerned Accordingly the words similarly apportioned have a definite meaning and are not ambiguous The word apportion is used in Explanation in the sense of split up so that similarly apportioned means similarly split up It is not open to the company to split up and apportion the dividends to the Profits of the two segments in such a manner as it finds convenient or thinks fit The fiction created by the Explanation is expressly limited to the purposes of sub and there is no justification for pursuing the fiction to its logical conclusion so as to permit it to operate beyond the limited purpose of sub Explanation creates the fiction that for the purpose of sub the income of the respective parts is to be regarded as the total income of each part so that the statutory percentages can be applied separately to the income of each part Sub section itself clarifies that by these words is meant total income as reduced by the amounts if any referred to in cls He has then to dissect the composite dividend declared by the company and apportion the same between the dividend relating to industrial profits and dividend relating to non industrial profits in the same ratios as the industrial profits bear to the total distributable profits and non industrial profits bear to the total distributable profits If he finds that the declared dividend apportioned to any part of the business is below the taxable minimum arrived at by applying the statutory percentage then the Income tax Officer has to levy additional super tax on the entire undistributed profits that is to say on the distributable profits minus the total composite dividend declared by the company A is a single levy and is on the undistributed profits on their entirety and therefore where on apportionment of the composite dividend declared by the company the industrial and non industrial profits the Income tax Officer finds that the apportioned dividend in any part of the company business is less than the dividend that ought to have been declared by application of the statutory percentage the Income tax Officer has to levy additional super tax on the entire undistributed profits even though in the other section of the business the declared dividend as apportioned may not be below the minimum that ought to have been distributed by the application of the statutory percentage This fiction cannot be extended for the purpose of deeming the profits of each part as total income for the purpose and levy of additional super tax as if there were as man total income as there were parts of business profits There is no other method It is undeniable that the words used in the latter part of the explanation are ambiguous The interpretation contended for by the revenue leads to anamolous results Tax Case No of arose out of the reference made by <ORG> under section of the Act while Tax Case No of arose out a reference made by the <ORG> in pursuance of an order made by <ORG> under section of the Act The question which arises for consideration in these appeals is whether under section A of the Act the assessee company is liable to pay additional super tax in respect of any portion of its profits Where the Income tax Officer is satisfied that in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends by any company within the twelve months immediately following the expiry of that previous year are less than the statutory percentage of the total income of the company of that previous year as reduced by a the amount of income tax and super tax payable by the company in respect of its total income but excluding the amount of any super tax payable under this section the amount of any other tax levied under any law for the time being in force on the company by the Government or by a local authority in excess of the amount if any which has been allowed in computing the total income and in the case of a banking company the amount actually transferred to a reserve fund under section of the Banking Companies Act the Income tax Officer shall unless be is satisfied that having regard to the losses incurred by the company in earlier years or to the smallness of the profits made in the previous year the payment of a dividend or a larger dividend than that declared would be unreasonable make an order in writing that the company shall apart from the sum determined as payable by it on the basis of the assessment under section be liable to pay super tax at the rate of fifty per cent in the case of a company whose business consists wbolly or mainly in the dealing in or holding of investments and at the rate of thirty seven per cent in the case of any other company on the undistributed balance of the total income of the previous year that is to say on the total income as reduced by the amounts if any referred to in clause a clause or clause and the dividends actually distributed if any ii In the case of an Indian company whose business consists wholly in the manufacture or processing of goods or in mining or in the generation or distribution of electricity or any other from of power iii In the case of an Indian company a part only of whose business consists in any of the activities specified in clause ii a in relation to the said part of the company business in relation to the remaining part of the company business if it is a company which satisfies the conditions specified in sub clause a of clause iv in any other case the said percentages being applied separately with reference to the amounts of profits and gains attributable to the two parts of the company business aforesaid as if the said amounts were respectively the total income of the company in relation to each of its parts the amount of dividends and taxes also being similarly apportioned for the purposes of subsection For the assessment year relevant to the previous year ended December the company was assessed to additional super tax under the aforesaid provision The Income tax Officer while making the assessment allocated the dividends declared by the company to the industrial and nonindustrial segments in the same proportion as the profits of the two segments bore to the total profits of the company The Appellate Assistant Commissioner having rejected the appeal the company carried the matter in a further appeal to <ORG> Madras Bench contending that it had declared dividends utilising the industrial and non industrial profits equally and since the dividends thus declared out of industrial profits exceeded the statutory percentage of the minimum distributable dividend as provided in section A the levy of additional super tax on the industrial profits was unjustified On the other hand it was submitted on behalf of <ORG> of section A to be apportioned in the same for the purposes of section A to be apportioned in the same ratio in which the profits themselves were apportioned between industrial and non industrial activities It held that there was no justification in Explanation for the apportionment of dividends in the ratio which the industrial profits bear to nonindustrial profits that it was open to the asssee to apportion the dividends in such a way as to conform to the requirements of section A in respect of one of the two segments of its business and that the profits of the other segment only would attract the incidence of additional super tax It has no application to companies in which the public are substantially interested The section provides for levy of additional super tax at per cent in the case of a company whose business consists wholly or mainly in the dealing in or holding of investments and at per cent in the case of any other company The additional super tax is leviable if in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends within the months immediately following the expiry of that previous year are less than the statutory percentage of the total income of the previous year as reduced by the amounts mentioned in clauses a and of sub section By undistributed balance of the total income is meant the total income as reduced by the amounts if any referred to in clauses a and of sub section and the dividends actually distributed if any Two questions arise for decision Whether the dividends distributed by the Company have to be apportioned as between the profits of the industrial and non industrial segments of its business in the same proportion as the respective profits bear to the total profits of the Company and Whether if on apportionment the dividend apportionment to one of the two segments is found to be less than the statutory percentage in respect of that segment the additional super tax is leviable on the entire balance of the Company undistributed profits or whether it is leviable on the balance of undistributed profits of that segment only in respect of which the short fall has occurred All the same it would be necessary to examine that question also as <ORG> has held that the liability to pay the additional super tax must be restricted to the undistributed profits of that segment only in respect of which the default has occurred It requires by its express terms that for the purposes of sub section the amount of dividends must be similarly apportioned But counsel for the respondent urged that since the Explanation does not refer to any apportionment at all the words similarly apportioned cannot be ascribed any rational meaning and it would therefore be open to the company to apportion the dividends to the profits of the two segments That word is used in Explanation in the sense of split up so that similarly apportioned means simply similarly split up It is thus not open to the company to split up and apportion the dividends to the profits of the two segments in such manner as it finds convenient or thinks fit by way of dividends and it does distribute that sum there is no violation of section A A similar apportionment of taxes it is urged by the respondent may in practice lead to impossible and unreal situations since the taxes on the profits of the two segments may be unequal as in the case of a newly established industrial undertaking which in respect of its industrial income may enjoy a tax concession There is no merit in this contention We have heard a full argument on this question and if we did not decide it the view of <ORG> is likely to cause misunderstanding In considering whether the company is liable to pay additional super tax on the entire balance of distributable profits it has to be borne in mind that section A is clearly penal in nature for in circumstances mentioned therein if a private company fails to distribute by way of dividends the statutory percentage of its distributable profits it becomes liable to pay apart from the sum deter mined as payable by it on the basis of the assessment under section super tax at per cent or per cent as the case may be on the undistributed balance of its distributable profits In the first place this provision being penal the burden would lie on the revenue to prove that the conditions laid down by the section are satisfied It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the language of section A read with Explanation is ambiguous and therefore the court ought to adopt the interpretation which favorites the assessee more particularly because the relevant provisions provide for the imposition of a penalty It is urged that the fiction created by Explanation must be given its full effect and that it must be carried to its logical con clusion Sub section provides that if the dividends distributed by a company are less than the statutory percentage of the total income of the company as reduced by the amounts mentioned in clauses a and the Income tax Officer shall make an order that the company shall be liable to pay additional super tax at the prescribed rates on the undistributed balance of the total income of the previous year that is to say on the total income as reduced by the amounts referred to in clauses a and and the dividends actually distributed The fiction created by the Explanation is thus expressly limited to the purposes of sub section and there is no justification for pursuing the fiction to its logical conclusion so As to permit it to operate beyond the limited purpose of sub section Explanation creates the fiction that for the purposes of sub section the income of the respective parts is to be regarded as the total income of each part so that the statutory percentages can be applied separately to the income of each part Sub section itself clarifies that by these words is meant total income as reduced by the amounts if any referred to in clause a clause or clause and the dividends actually distributed if any In the result we set aside the order of <ORG> and allow the appeal with costs
