The appellant filed an application to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint The appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the court on some other grounds also challenging the validity of the sanction On a plain reading of section it would follow that nothing in the code which would include section shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of <ORG> However it cannot be said that the said bar is not to operate in the exercise of the inherent power at all because it would be setting at naught one of the limitation imposed upon the exercise of revisional powers A happy and harmonious solution would be to say that the bar provided in section operates only in exercise of the revisional power of <ORG> meaning thereby that <ORG> will have no power of revision in relation to any interlocutory order in case the impugned order brings about a situation which is an abuse of the process of the court or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice interference by <ORG> is absolutely necessary then nothing contained in section can limit of affect the exercise of the inherent power by <ORG> Even if it is assumed that an order of the <ORG> taking cognisance or issuing process is an interlocutory order the bar created by section will not prevent <ORG> from exercising its inherent power for stopping the criminal proceeding as early as possible instead of harassing the accused upto the end If it were so it would render almost nugatory the revisional power of the Sessions <ORG> or High <ORG> conferred by section There may be an order passed during the course of a proceeding which may be not final but yet it may not be interlocutory order pure or simple The court allowed the appeal set aside <ORG> Judgment and remitted the case back to <ORG> to dispose of on merits The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by special leave from the order of <ORG> rejecting the application in revision filed by the appellant under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter to be referred to as the Code or the new Code on the ground that it was not maintainable in view of the provision contained in subsection of section Thereafter on tile th February <NAME> the appellant filed an application to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint The stand taken on behalf of the appellant was that allegations were made against Shri <NAME> in relation to what he had done in his personal capacity and not in his capacity of discharging his functions as a Minister They are That even assuming the allegations made against <NAME> were defamatory they were not in respect of his conduct in the discharge of his public functions and hence the aggrieved person could file a complaint in the Court of a competent Magistrate who after taking cognizance could try the case or commit it to <ORG> if so warranted in law The appellant thereupon challenged the order of the Sessions Judge in the revision filed by him in <ORG> As already stated without entering into the merits of any of the contentions raised by the appellant it upheld the preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the revision application In <NAME> case as in this the order of the <ORG> issuing process against the accused was challenged and <ORG> was asked to quash the criminal proceeding either in exercise of its inherent power under section of the Code corresponding to section A of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter called the Code or the old Code or under section of the new Code corresponding to section of the old Code Two points were decided in <NAME> case in the following terms While we fully agree with the view taken by the learned Judge that where a revision to <ORG> against the order of the Subordinate Judge is expressly barred under sub of of the Code the inherent powers contained in would not be available to defeat the bar contained in Under section of the Code the High <ORG> had the power to call for and examine the record of any proceeding before any inferior Criminal <ORG> situate within the local limits of its jurisdiction for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness legality or propriety of any finding sentence or order recorded or passed Apart from the revisional power the High <ORG> possessed and possesses the inherent powers to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do the real and the substantial justice for the administration of which alone <ORG>s exist Under section of the Code revisional power has been conferred on the High <ORG> in terms which are identical to those found in section of the Code It says Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of <ORG> to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any <ORG> or otherwise to secure the ends of justice At the outset the following principles may be noticed in relation to the exercise of the inherent power of <ORG> which have been followed ordinarily and generally almost invariably barring a few exceptions That the power is not to be resorted to if there is a specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party That it should be exercised very sparingly to prevent abuse of process of any <ORG> or otherwise to secure the ends of justice That it should not be exercised as against the express bar of law engrafted in any other provision of the Code Sometimes the revisional jurisdiction of <ORG> has also been resorted to for the same kind of relief by challenging the order taking cognizance or issuing processes or framing charge on the grounds that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to take cognizance and proceed with the trial that the issuance of process was wholly illegal or void or that no charge could be framed as no offence was made out on the allegations made or the evidence adduced in <ORG> On the one hand a bar has been put in the way of <ORG> as also of the Sessions Judge for exercise of the revisional power in relation to any interlocutory order on the other the power has been conferred in almost the same terms as it was in the Code But if we were to say that the said bar is not to operate in the exercise of the inherent power at all it will be setting at naught one of the limitations imposed upon the exercise of the revisional powers But in case the impugned order clearly brings about a situation which is an abuse of the process of the <ORG> or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice interference by <ORG> is absolutely necessary then nothing contained in section can limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power by <ORG> Even assuming although we shall presently show that it is not so that in such a case an order of the <ORG> taking cognizance or issuing processes is an interlocutory order The label of the petition filed by an aggrieved party is immaterial as he then was delivering the judgment of this <ORG> pointed out if we may say so with respect very succinctly the scope of the inherent power of <ORG> for the purpose of quashing a criminal proceeding Says the learned Judge at pages Ordinarily criminal proceedings instituted against an accused person must be tried under the provisions of the Code and <ORG> would be reluctant to interfere with the said proceedings at an interlocutory stage ble desirable or expedient to lay down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of this inherent jurisdiction There may be cases where it may be possible for <ORG> to take the view that the institution or continuance of criminal proceedings against an accused person may amount to the abuse of the process of the court or that the quashing of the impugned proceedings would secure the ends of justice If the criminal proceeding in question is in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by an accused person and it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance of the said proceeding <ORG> would be justified in quashing the proceeding on that ground Cases may also arise where the allegations in the First Information Report or the complaint even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged in such cases no question of appreciating evidence arises it is a matter merely of looking at the complaint or the First Information Report to decide whether the offence alleged is disclosed or not In cases falling under this category the allegations made against the accused person do constitute an offence alleged but there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to In dealing with this class of cases it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is manifestly and clearly inconsistent with the accusation made and cases where there is legal evidence which on its appreciation may not support the accusation in question In volume of the third edition of Halsbury Laws of England at page however it has been stated in para a judgment or order may be final for one purpose and interlocutory for another or final as to part and interlocutory as to part In para it is said In general a judgment or order which determines the principal matter in question is termed final In para at pages and we find the words An order which does not deal with the final rights of the parties but either is made before judgment and gives no final decision on the matters in dispute but is merely on a matter of procedure or is made after judgment and merely directs how the declarations of right already given in the final judgment are to be worked out is termed interlocutory To the same effect are the observations quoted from the judgments of <NAME> and <NAME> Applying the said test almost on facts similar to the ones in the instant case it was held that the order in revision passed by the High <ORG> at that time there was no bar like section was not a final order within the meaning of section of the Government of India Act In our opinion if this strict test were to be applied in interpreting the words interlocutory order occurring in section then the order taking cognizance of an offence by a <ORG> whether it is so done illegally or without jurisdiction will not be a final order and hence will be an interlocutory one But in our judgment such an interpretation and the universal application of the principle that what is not a final order must be an interlocutory order is neither warranted nor justified If it were so it will render almost nugatory the revisional power of the Sessions <ORG> or the High <ORG> conferred on it by section There may be an order passed during the course of a proceeding which may not be final in the sense noticed in <NAME> case supra but yet it may not be an interlocutory order pure or simple it has been pointed out A case may be said to be decided if the Court adjudicates for the purposes of the suit some right or obligation of the parties in controversy We may give a clear example of an order in a civil case which may not be a final order within the meaning of Article of the Constitution yet it will not be purely or simply of an interlocutory character Suppose for example a defendant raises the plea of jurisdiction of a particular <ORG> to try the suit or the bar of limitation and succeeds then the action is determined finally in that <ORG> One of the tests is If the order in question is reversed would the action have to go on Applying that test to the facts of the instant case it would be noticed that if the plea of the appellant succeeds and the order of the Sessions Judge is reversed the criminal proceeding as initiated and instituted against him cannot go on whether the appellant had committed the offence charged against him therein Yet for the reasons already alluded to we feel no difficulty in coming to the conclusion after due consideration that an order rejecting the plea of the accused on a point which when accepted will conclude the particular proceeding will surely be not an interlocutory order within the meaning of section that an order made in a criminal proceeding against a person who is not a party to the enquiry or trial and which adversely affected him is not an interlocutory order within the meaning of section Referring to a passage from the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case the passage which is to be found in Halsbury Laws of England Volume it has been said by <NAME> delivering the judgment of the <ORG> at page It may thus be conclusive with reference to the stage at which it is made and it may also be conclusive as to a person who is not a party to the enquiry or trial against whom it is directed As already mentioned the view expressed in <NAME> case may be open to debate or difference Before we conclude we may point out an obvious almost insurmountable difficulty in the way of applying literally the test laid down in <NAME> case and in holding that an order of the kind under consideration being not a final order must necessarily be an interlocutory one If a complaint is dismissed under section or under section or the <ORG> holds the proceeding to be void or discharges the accused a revision to <ORG> at the instance of the complainant or the prosecutor would be competent otherwise it will make section of the new Code otiose Does it stand to reason then that an accused will have no remedy to move <ORG> in revision or invoke its inherent power for the quashing of the criminal proceeding initiated upon a complaint or otherwise and which is fit to be quashed on the face of it The legislature left the power to order further inquiry intact in section For the reasons stated above we allow this appeal set aside the judgment and order of <ORG> and remit the case back to it to dispose of the appellant petition on merits in the manner it may think fit and proper to do in accordance with the law and in the light of this judgment
