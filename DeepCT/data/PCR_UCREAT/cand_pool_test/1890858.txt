If the answer is in the affirmative as we think it must be there is a subsidiary question as to whether his remedy is by application under Section or of the Civil Procedure Code or by a separate suit The decree under which the sale was held was a decree for sale on the basis of a mortgage executed in favour of the respondents by one <NAME> The decree was made final on nd January The Courts below dismissed the application That was a case in which property was sold in execution of a simple money decree The decree holders have therefore obtained from the auction purchaser under an in valid decree money to which they have no right and there is a clear equity in favour of the purchaser entitling him to recover it back They quoted with approval the judgment of Cairns in <NAME> Comptoir Escompte de Paris at Moo It has been argued for the respondents that the decree was not wholly set aside but was only set aside in so far as it affected <NAME> The latter have obtained money to which they were not entitled under a decree and sale which were invalid and they are bound in equity to restore it to the appellant The words varied or reversed used in Section seem more applicable to a proceeding by way of appeal revision or review than to a separate suit declaring that a decree is not binding on a particular party In the auction purchaser can be regarded as the representative of the judgment debtor whose interest he purported to acquire the question is prima facie one coming under Section It is a question relating to the satisfaction of a decree for it alleges that money has been wrongfully applied in satisfaction of the decree for the view that a stranger purchaser at Court auction is entitled and bound to have any question relating to the satisfying of the decree decided under Section There is admittedly no question outstanding between the patties except that which has been decided in this appeal and to require the question to be now tried out in a regular suit would be merely to put the parties to unnecessary expense For the reasons already given we allow the appeal and give the appellant a decree for the amount claimed against the respondents decree holders with costs in all <ORG> including in this <ORG> fees or the higher scale if any
