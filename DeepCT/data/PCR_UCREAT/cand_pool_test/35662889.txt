This appeal is brought by special leave against the judgment of <ORG> dated November dismissing the writ petition No of filed by the appellant <NAME> The notification provided that the case being one of urgency the provisions of sub section of of the Act applied to the land and it was therefore directed under sub of that the provisions of A of the Act would not apply to the land On October a further notification was issued under of the Act declaring that the Governor was satisfied that the land mentioned in the notification was needed for public purposes and directing the Collector of Mirzapur to take order for acquisition of the land under of the Act The Collector of Mirzapur was further directed by the notification under of the Act the case being one of urgency to take possession of any waste or arable land on the expiration of the notice mentioned in though no award under had been made The appellant thereafter filed an application under of the Act for a reference to <ORG> in regard to the amount of compensation payable On May the Writ Petition giving rise to this appeal was filed by the appellant in <ORG> It was further claimed that the mines and minerals in the land belonged to the appellant and as such he was entitled to compensation for the same The appellant accordingly prayed for a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash the notifications of <ORG> under and of the Act and all further proceedings in pursuance of that notice in the land acquisition case By its judgment dated November <ORG> dismissed the Writ Petition holding that the petitioner was not the owner of mines and minerals and was not entitled to compensation for them that the land had been acquired for a public purpose and that the provisions of of the Act were applicable to the case and there was no illegality in the notifications of <ORG> under and of the Act In our opinion the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant cannot be accepted It is manifest that the declaration made by <ORG> in the notification under of the Act that the land was required for a public purpose is made conclusive by sub of and it is therefore not open to a court to go behind it any try to satisfy itself whether in fact the acquisition was for a public purpose If it appears that what the <ORG> is satisfied about is not a public purpose but a private purpose or no purpose at all the action of the <ORG> would be colourable as being outside the power conferred upon it by the Act and its declaration under of the Act will be a nullity It is conceded on behalf of the respondents that the allegation of the appellant that cement was being sold in market for profit was not clearly controverted by the counter affidavit by the <ORG> but it was said that even on the assumption that the cement was sold for profit the use of the lime stone in the production of the cement was in public interest because the profit from the sale of cement benefited the General Revenues of the <ORG> We then proceed to consider the argument of the appellant that the notification under of the Act is illegal since the land in dispute is neither waste nor arable land and the jurisdiction of <ORG> to act under and of the Act depends upon the preliminary condition that the land to be acquired is waste or arable land Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose a notification to that effect shall be published in the Official Gazette and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality Any person interested in any land which has been notified under section sub section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a <ORG> may within thirty days after the issue of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Every objection under sub section shall be made to the Collector in writing and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry if any as he thinks necessary submit the case for the decision of the appropriate <ORG> together with the record of the proceedings held by him and a report containing his recommendations on the objections The decision of the appropriate <ORG> on the objections shall be final Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act when the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report if any made under section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a <ORG> a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such <ORG> or of some officer duly authorised to certify its orders Provided that no such declaration shall be made unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by a <ORG> or wholly or party out of public revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local authority The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a <ORG> as the case may be and after making such declaration the appropriate <ORG> may acquire the land in manner hereinafter appearing Section relates to the power of the Collector to take possession of the land When the Collector has made an award under section he may take possession of the land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Section confers special powers in cases of urgency and reads as follows In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purposes or for a <ORG> Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river said or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the notification under section sub section It was pointed out that the Collector noticed that there were one lac of trees in the acquired land and there were trees of Tendu Asan Sidh Bijaisal Khair bamboo clumps Mahuwa and Kakora contained in the area In our opinion the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant is well founded and must be accepted as correct and in view of the facts mentioned in the affidavits and in the Inspection Note of the Collector dated December we are of the opinion that the land sought to be acquired is not waste land or arable land within the meaning of or of the Act It follows therefore that of the Act is not attracted to the present case and <ORG> had therefore no authority to give a direction to the Collector to take possession of the lands under of the Act In our opinion the condition imposed by is a condition upon which the jurisdiction of <ORG> depends and it is obvious that by wrongly deciding the question as to the character of the land <ORG> cannot give itself jurisdiction to give a direction to the Collector to take possession of the land under of the Act It is well established that where the jurisdiction of an administrative authority depends upon a preliminary finding of fact <ORG> is entitled in a proceeding of writ of certiorari to determine upon its independent judgment whether or not that finding of fact is correct See Shoreditch Assessment Committee It was also contended for the appellant that the order of <ORG> under of the Act that the provisions of A of the Act were not applicable to the land was illegal because the land was not waste or arable land to which the provisions of were applicable It was urged that by issuing the impugned notification <ORG> deprived the appellant of a valuable right i of filing an objection under A of the Act and therefore the entire proceedings taken by the Land Acquisition Officer after the issue of the notification under were defective in law If therefore <ORG> had come to the conclusion that the provisions of sub were applicable to the land because the land was waste or arable land the subjective opinion of <ORG> cannot be challenged in a court of law except on the ground of colourable exercise of power It is true that the opinion of <ORG> which is a condition for the exercise of the power under of the Act is subjective and a <ORG> cannot normally enquire whether there were sufficient grounds or justification for the opinion formed by <ORG> under But even though the power of <ORG> has been formulated under of the Act in subjective terms the expression of opinion of <ORG> can be challenged as ultra vires in a <ORG> of Law if it could be shown that <ORG> never applied its mind to the matter or that the action of <ORG> is mala fide If therefore in a case the land under acquisition is not actually waste or arable land but <ORG> has formed the opinion that the provisions of sub of are applicable the <ORG> may legitimately draw an inference that <ORG> did not honestly form that opinion or that in forming that opinion <ORG> did not apply its mind to the relevant facts bearing on the question at issue It follows therefore that the notification of <ORG> under of the Act directing that the provisions of A shall not apply to the land is ultra vires <ORG> set aside the declaration of <ORG> on two grounds that though it was made in exercise of an administrative function and in good faith the power was limited by the terms of the said Ordinance and therefore the declaration was liable to a challenge if the authority stepped beyond those terms and that the ground on which it was made was other than the one set out in the Ordinance the appellant challenged an order of collective fine passed under Regulation of the Cyprus Emergency Powers Collective Punishment Regulations which provided that if an offence was committed within any area of the colony and the Commissioner has reason to believe that all or any of the inhabitants of that area failed to take reasonable steps to prevent it and to render assistance to discover the offender or offenders it would be lawful for the Commissioner with the approval of the Governor to levy a collective fine after holding an inquiry in such manner as he thinks proper subject to satisfying himself that the inhabitants of the area had been given an adequate opportunity of understanding the subject matter of the inquiry and making representations thereon It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the only duty case on the Commissioner was to satisfy himself of the facts set out in the Regulation that the test was a subjective one and that the statement as to the satisfaction in his affidavit was a complete answer to the contention of the respondents In rejecting the contention <ORG> observed as follows Their Lordships feel the force of this argument but they think that if it could be shown that there were no grounds upon which the Commissioner could be so satisfied a court might infer either that he did not honestly form that view or that in forming it he could not have applied his mind to the relevant facts It was held by <ORG> that it was entitled to award prohibition against the board if the board was acting without any evidence to support the facts upon which its jurisdiction depended or if it was adopting an erroneous test of the employer liability to cancellation of his registration or if it appeared likely to go outside the scope of its statutory discretion We shall pass now to consider the question whether the appellant had sub soil and mineral rights in the areas in dispute and whether the appellant was entitled to compensation for the minerals including lime stone in that area Be it known to you <NAME> of Parganah Agori as it appears from your statement that the above Parganah is your ancient and hereditary estate and that some years ago <NAME> forcibly dispossessed you and took possession of it himself The Sanad appears on page of the Paper Book and reads as follows Know ye the present and future Mutsuddies in office the zamindars the Chowdhuries the Residents the Mahtoos the Ryots the cultivators and the inhabitants of Agori Barhar of Sirkar Chunar in subah Allahabad that in conformity to the orders of His Excellency the most Noble Richard Marquis Wellesley Knight of the Illustrious order of Saint Patrick Governor General in Council issued on the th November on a consideration of the good services rendered to the Hon ble Company by <NAME> and his consequent merits lands in the above Purgunnah producing Rs In our opinion a reading of the two <NAME>s supports the case of the appellant that there is no reservation of mineral rights in favour of the Government In other words a transfer of the right to the surface conveys right to the minerals underneath unless there is an express or implied reservation in the grant When neither of the parties knew undiscovered minerals underneath the land and the idea of reservation never entered their minds it cannot be held that there was any implied reservation in the grant Nor can afterwards a distinction be drawn between the various rights that may exist on the land for the purpose of qualifying the original grant and importing into it what neither party could have imagined It was argued on behalf of the respondents that the assessment was made on the agricultural income but this circumstance cannot derogate from the rights conveyed to the <NAME> in the two <NAME>s because no restriction was placed on the use of the land and the use by the <NAME> was not limited to agriculture The preamble to Regulation I of which relates to the Province of Benares states that the Governor General in Council having determined with the concurrence of the Rajah of Benares to introduce into that province as far as local circumstances will admit the same system of interior administration as has been established in the provinces of Bengal Bihar and Orissa and the limitation of the annual revenue payable from the lands forming an essential part of that system as stated in the preamble to Regulation II It appears that Pargana Agori was permanently settled under the provisions of the Benares Regulation I of and there was no material difference between the permanent settlement of Benares province and that of the Provinces of Bengal Bihar and Orissa at page Passing to the settlement of it appears to their Lordships to be beyond controversy that whatever doubts be entertained as to whether before the British occupation the zamindars had any proprietary interest in the lands comprised within their respective districts the settlement its recognizes and proceeds on the footing that they are the actual proprietors of the land for which they undertake to pay the Government revenue It has been held in those cases that in the absence of the right to sub soil minerals being conferred on the tenure holder under the terms of the tenure held by him he does not get any right to them There are other documents which support the view that the mineral rights and sub soil rights in the area belonged to the appellant There are also subordinate leases produced on behalf of the appellant to show that the right to minerals was always enjoyed by the appellant and not by the lessees for instance Annexure A at page of the Paper Book is a deed of agreement executed by <NAME> on September There are similar clauses in the agreements Annexures A to A and A to A Reference was also made on behalf of the appellant to the letter of Mr <NAME> dated October to the Secretary to <ORG> Annexure wherein he states that In the settled portion of the Mirzapur district the <ORG> lays no claim to the soil which includes any mineral products that may be discovered We are therefore of the opinion that the appellant is the owner of all minerals and sub soil rights of <ORG> and the view taken by <ORG> on this aspect of the case must be overruled On behalf of the respondents reference was made to the Mirzapur Stone Mahal Act Act of and it was pointed out that under of that Act no proprietor was entitled to place any prohibition or restriction or to demand or receive any sum by way of rent premium duty or price in respect of the opening quarry or the quarrying of stone in the land or in respect of the storing of stone at the quarry or the transport of stone over the land But there is nothing in this statute which takes away the right of the zemindar to the minerals For the reasons already expressed we hold that <ORG> has no jurisdiction to apply the provisions of and of the Act to the land in dispute and to order that the provisions of A of the Act will not apply to the land We accordingly hold that a writ in the nature of certiorari should be granted quashing the notification of <ORG> dated October by which the Governor has applied and to the land in dispute and directed that the provisions of A of the Act should not apply to the land We accordingly allow this appeal to the extent indicated above and set aside the judgment of <ORG> dated November
