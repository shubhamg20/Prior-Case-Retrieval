The accused No has been convicted of the offences a of fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment for seven years of wrongful confinement of causing criminal proceedings to be instituted against a person without just or lawful ground of giving false evidence with intent to procure conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment for seven years The fourth accused has been convicted a of the abetment of the institution of criminal proceedings knowing that there was no just or lawful ground for such proceedings of the abetment of wrongful confinement falsely to confess to complicity in the crime and to acquiesce in being prosecuted for it the object being that the accused or some of them might share the loot with the real thieves that to this end the accused wrongfully confined <NAME> fabricated false evidence in order to procure his conviction knowingly instituted a false prosecution against him and in that prosecution gave false evidence in order to secure his conviction On the nd December <NAME> is taken before the Magistrate and there he makes the confession which he had been tutored to make and which is Exhibit in this case It appears to us desirable to consider the case first in its broader aspects paying special regard to natural and ordinary probabilities consistent with the usual motives of human conduct There is no conceivable reason why he should have forced suspicion on himself by running away no motive why he should confess and if we concede that all this happened so yet we must go further and suppose that <NAME> also happened to have secreted the property just at this particular spot where the <ORG> happened to come upon him although this particular spot is in the lands of Patkul and <NAME> is a permanent resident of Sholapur and has no sort of connection with Patkul a village some forty miles away Postponing for a moment the consideration of this suggestion let us examine the evidence for it is upon the evidence that the appeal must be decided First then we have an overwhelming body of evidence which traces the second accused with <NAME> and <NAME> from Sholapur through Mohol and Pokhrapur to Adhegaon and so to Patkul This journey is proved not only by <NAME> but by a large body of unrelated witnesses who come from various villages are wholly independent of one another and of this case and have not any interest to link them together nor has any one of them any cause of grudge or malice against any one of these accused For since we have the truth of <NAME> evidence on these essential parts of the case thus demonstrated there is no conceivable reason why we should not trust <NAME> also in regard to the preceding events at Sholapur indeed that evidence and that evidence alone can account for the presence of the whole party at Patkul and the travesty which was there played out The result is that on the testimony of <NAME> and the corroborating testimony of the witnesses from the villages and from Sholapur reinforced by the general considerations to which we have referred at the beginning of this judgment we have the whole case for the <ORG> established from the preliminary machinations in Sholapur down to <NAME> extorted confession of the nd December We have however in addition the evidence of the <ORG> spy and accomplice <NAME> It remains to notice such arguments as seem to call for notice in respect of each accused who has appeared by counsel or pleader There is no person living of whom it can be or has been suggested that he bears malice not only against these <ORG> accused but simultaneously also against the wealthy <NAME> of Sholapur and the <ORG> Patil of the remote village Patkul It is thus abundantly proved that as there was no motive or occasion for anybody to bring false accusations against the first or any other accused so there was no time or change or opportunity for any such concoction The point is that objection is taken on the ground that accused No was charged and tried jointly with the accused No though one of the charges against the accused No was like the charge against accused No himself the charge of giving false evidence against <NAME> From this circumstance it is urged that the joint trial of accused No with accused No was illegal and for this argument reliance is placed upon the decision of this Bench in King Emperor <NAME> Bom The offences says the Bench were distinct there was no charge of mutual abetment or con spiracy such as under Section might possibly have justified a joint trial We may add that during the course of the hearing before the Sessions Judge additional charges were framed against the fifth accused charging him with abetment of the other accused in respect of other offences committed in the course of this plot and here as there the accusation against all the accused persons is that they carried out a single scheme by successive acts done at intervals but there was complete unity of project and the whole series of acts were so linked together by one motive and design as to constitute one transaction within the meaning of Section It is to be observed that in this original deposition there is nothing to suggest that the accused No did not accompany the <ORG> party from the village Patkul itself indeed that is the plain implication in the deposition but the main ground upon which the deposition is now sought to be saved is not that accused No was with the <ORG> party when they started but that after they had started and had been gone some minutes a Constable came and fetched the <NAME> who then followed the party to the waste land There is nothing on the record to bear out the accused present attempted defence or to suggest that the witnesses should not be believed We must therefore come to the conclusion that the <NAME> did not accompany the <ORG> party on their excursion which led to the seizure of Tukya and all that part of his deposition to which reference has been made was false in fact That however has no bearing upon the charge upon which he has been convicted and which for the reasons given has in our opinion been fully established against him Our judgment has run to some length owing solely to the importance of the case and not at all to the difficulty for difficulty there was none
