The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeals by special leave are directed against the judgments and orders of <ORG> exercising its powers under Arts and of the Constitution in respect of orders passed by the Revenue Authorities under the provisions of the Eastern Bengal and Assam Excise Act They raise certain common questions of constitutional law and have therefore been heard together and will be disposed of by this Judgment Though there are certain common features in the pattern of the proceedings relating to the settlement of certain country spirit shops when they passed through the hierarchy of the authorities under the Act the facts of each case are different and have to be stated separately in so far as it is necessary to state them The two appellants <NAME> and <NAME> are partners the partnership having been formed in view of the <ORG> notification dated November amending rule of the Assam Excise Rules to the effect that the settlement of the country spirit shops which may be declared by the <ORG> to be big shops shall be made with two or more partners who shall not belong to the same family nor should be related to one another vide correction slip at of the Assam Excise Manual The appellants as members of the partnership aforesaid submitted a tender in the prescribed form All those cases were heard together and <ORG> by its judgment dated May quashed the orders passed by the first respondent chiefly on the ground that <ORG> had been illegally constituted The result of the ruling of this Court was that the determination by <ORG> that the orders passed by the first respondent were void was set aside and the settlement made by that <ORG> consequently stood restored The tender submitted by the appellants was not considered by the licensing authority on the erroneous ground that the orders passed by the first respondent as the ultimate <ORG> in the matter of settlement of excise shops had been rendered null and void as a result of the decision of <ORG> referred to above The appellants as also others who were competitors for the settlement aforesaid preferred appeals to the Excise Commissioner who set aside the settlement made in favour of the respondents and and ordered settlement of the shop with the appellants The third and the fourth respondents as also other dissatisfied tenderers preferred appeals to the first respondent against the order of the second respondent the Excise Commissioner and of the Constitution for an appropriate writ for quashing the order passed by the first respondent The main ground of decision in <ORG> was that <ORG> had acted in excess of its jurisdiction and that its order was vitiated by errors apparent on the face of the record The appeals filed by the appellant and other disappointed tenderers were dismissed by the Excise Commissioner by his order dated March Against the said order the appellant and another party filed further appeals to the Commissioner of <ORG> who by his order dated May set aside the settlement in favour of the first respondent and ordered settlement with the appellant In pursuance of that order the appellant took possession of the shop with effect from June But curiously enough the Deputy Commissioner by an ex parte order on June directed that the first respondent be put in charge of the shop forthwith and the order was carried out No order was passed on that petition For the year also the lease had been granted to them by the Deputy Commissioner after consultation with <ORG> The first appellant and his father filed an appeal before <ORG> against the order of <NAME> The first respondent and some others preferred appeals before <NAME> against the order aforesaid of the Deputy Commissioner As there was <ORG> functioning at the time as a result of the decision aforesaid of <ORG> declaring the constitution of such an Authority to be void the first appellant moved <ORG> under Arts and of the Constitution on the ground that the order of the Excise Commissioner was vitiated by an error apparent on the face of the record in so far as he had misunderstood the order of the Supreme <ORG> passed on the stay petition The High <ORG> ultimately dismissed the writ application by its order dated December The appeal filed by the appellant and his father already pending in this <ORG> was heard and determined as aforesaid in January This <ORG> reversed the decision of <ORG> and restored the status of <ORG> The appellants and other parties preferred appeals against the said order of settlement made by the Deputy Commissioner Against that order respondents I and and others preferred appeals before <ORG> who by an order dated June dismissed the appeals This was done on a complete misapprehension of the true effect of the order of <ORG> maintaining status quo ante If <ORG> had passed its order in a less sophisticated and more easily understood language in that part of the country perhaps the party in possession would not have been dispossessed of the shop settled with it The appellants moved <ORG> against the Commissioner order directing possession to be given to the respondents and The High <ORG> issued a rule but refused to grant stay of the operation of the order directing possession to be given During the final hearing of the rule before <ORG> the appellants again moved a petition on July for vacating the order of possession which was based on a misapprehension of the order of <ORG> maintaining status quo ante but apparently no order was passed because possession had already been given to the respondents I and As there was no third judge at the time the disposal of the case naturally had to stand over until the third judge was available The petitioners also approached <ORG> but it refused to reconsider the matter as the case was then pending before <ORG> The vacancy of the third judge had not been filled till then and as the appellants felt that they had been wrongfully deprived of their right to hold their shop as a result of an erroneous interpretation of the order of <ORG> passed on June as aforesaid and as there was no prospect of the case being disposed of quickly the appellants moved this <ORG> and obtained special leave to appeal Under the Act an appeal from an order of settlement made by a Deputy Commissioner or Sub Divisional officer lies to the Commissioner of Excise and from an order of the Commissioner of Excise to <ORG> whose decision becomes final Orders passed under this Act or under any rule made hereunder shall be appealable as follows in the manner prescribed by such rules as the State Government may make in this behalf a to the Excise Commissioner any order passed by the District Collector or a Collector other than the District Collector to <ORG> appointed by the State Government for the purpose any order passed by the Excise Commissioner The power of hearing appeals and revisions under the Act has been vested successively in the <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and ultimately under the amended section in <ORG> It is convenient first to deal with the general questions of public importance raised on behalf of the appellant in Civil Appeal No of At the forefront of the arguments advanced on behalf of <ORG> was the plea that the several authorities already indicated concerned with the settlement of excise shops like those in question in these appeals are merely administrative bodies and therefore their orders whether passed in the first instance or on appeal should not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction or supervisory jurisdiction of <ORG> under Arts It is true that no one has an inherent right to settlement of liquor shops but when the <ORG> by public notice invites candidates for settlement to make their tenders and in pursuance of such a notice a number of persons make such tenders each one makes a claim for himself in opposition to the claims of the others and the public authorities concerned with the settlement have to choose from amongst them Where there is a right vested in an authority created by statute be it administrative or quasijudicial to hear appeals and revisions it becomes its duty to hear judicially that is to say in an objective manner impartially and after giving reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned in the dispute to place their respective cases before it They must deal with the question referred to them without bias and they must give to each of the parties the opportunity of adequately presenting the case made The decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of responsibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice <ORG> has wisely laid down certain rules to be observed in the performance of its functions in these matters and those rules must be observed because they are imposed by statute and for no other reason and whether they give much or little opportunity for what I may call quasi litigious procedure depends solely on what <ORG> has thought right Thus if in order to arrive at the decision the body concerned had to consider proposals and objections and consider evidence if at some stage of the proceedings leading up to the decision there was something in the nature of a lis before it then in the course of such consideration and at that stage the body would be under a duty to act judicially The authorities under the Act with Sub divisional Officers at the bottom and <ORG> at the apex of the hierarchy are charged with those duties The rules under the Act and the executive instructions which have no statutory force but which are meant for the guidance of the officers concerned enjoin upon those officers the duty of seeing to it that shops are settled with persons of character and experience in the line subject to certain reservations in Vol Except those general con siderations there are no specific rules governing the grant of leases or licences in respect of liquor shops and in a certain contingency even drawing of lots is provided for vide Executive Instructions at of the Manual The words of sub of as amended set out above vest complete discretion in <ORG> the Excise Commissioner or the District Collector to pass such orders thereon as it or he may think fit The sections of the Act do not make any reference to the recording of evidence or hearing of parties or even recording reasons for orders passed by the authorities aforesaid That is also apparent from the several orders passed by them in course of these few cases that are before us But when we come to the rules relating to appeals and revisions we find that the widest scope for going up in appeal or revision has been given to persons interested because only lays down that no appeal shall lie against the orders of composition thus leaving all other kinds of orders open to appeal or revision Rule provides that every memorandum of appeal shall be presented within one month from the date of the order appealed against subject to the requisite time for obtaining a certified copy of the order being excluded Rule was further amended by the Notification dated March by adding the following proviso and explanations to that rule Provided further that the competent <ORG> shall have the power to admit the appeal after the prescribed period of limitation when the appellant satisfies the <ORG> that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period As would appear from the ruling of this Court at where the provisions and effect of the Assam Revenue <ORG> Transfer of Powers Act Assam IV of have been set out the ultimate jurisdiction to hear appeals and revisions was divided between <ORG> and the <ORG> referred to in of that Act Appeals and revisions arising out of cases covered by the provisions of the enactments specified in Schedule A to that Act were to lie in and to be heard by <ORG> and the jurisdiction to entertain appeals and revisions in matters arising under the provisions of the enactments specified in Schedule to that Act was vested in the <ORG> to be set up under that is to say for the purposes of the present appeals before us the Excise Appellate <ORG> There is no indication that they make any distinction between the grounds of interference on appeal and in revision In the latter case this <ORG> dealing with the powers of the Tribunal <ORG> under of Ordinance No of observed Like all courts of appeal exercising general jurisdiction in civil cases the respondent has been constituted an appellate court in words of the widest amplitude and the legislature has not limited his jurisdiction by providing that such exercise will depend on the existence of any particular state of facts Thus on a review of the provisions of the Act and the rules framed thereunder it cannot be said that the authorities mentioned in of the Act pass purely administrative orders which are beyond the ambit of <ORG> power of supervision and control The first contention raised on behalf of the appellant must therefore be overruled Now turning to the merits of <ORG> order it was contended on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> had misdirected itself in holding that <ORG> had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the order it did There is no doubt that if <ORG> whose duty it is to determine questions affecting the right to settlement of a liquor shop in a judicial or quasi judicial manner acts in excess of its authority vested by law that is to say the Act and the rules thereunder its order is subject to the controlling authority of <ORG> In the instant cases <ORG> is contemplated by of the Act to be the highest authority for deciding questions of settlement of liquor shops as between rival claimants It is true that <ORG> should not lightly set aside the selection made by the primary <ORG> that is to say a selection made by a Subdivisions Officer or by a District Collector should be given due weight in view of the fact that they have much greater opportunity to know local conditions and local business people than <ORG> even as the appeal courts are enjoined not to interfere lightly with findings of fact recorded by the original courts which had the opportunity of seeing witnesses depose in court and their demeanour while deposing in court In this connection <ORG> has made reference to the several affidavits filed on either side and the order in which they As already indicated the rules make no provisions for the reception of evidence oral or documentary or the hearing of oral arguments or even for the issue of notice of the hearing to the parties concerned In the instant case no such rules have been brought to our notice which could be said to have been contravened by <ORG> It remains to consider the last contention raised on behalf of the appellants in these cases namely whether there has been any error apparent on the face of the record in the order of <ORG> which would attract the supervisory jurisdiction of <ORG> of the Constitution That leads us to a consideration of the nature of the error which can be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record which would be one of the grounds to attract the supervisory jurisdiction of <ORG> under Art In fact there was no such admission It was held by the Commissioner on the contrary that the learned Deputy Commissioner and members of <ORG> thought that the major son who bears an excellent character should not be punished for the alleged sin of his father to issue a writ of certiorari on the specific ground that the orders impugned before it had been vitiated by errors apparent on the face of the record errors not of law but of fact The ancient case of the <NAME> <NAME> is treated as a landmark on the question of the power to issue a writ or order of certiorari Lord <NAME> while discharging the rule made the following observations in the course of his judgment which have been treated as authoritative and good law even now The first of these is a point of much importance because of very general application but the principle upon which it turns is very simple the difficulty is always found in applying it The case to be supposed is one like the present in which the <ORG> has trusted the original it may be as here the final jurisdiction on the merits to the magistrates below in which this <ORG> has no jurisdiction as to the merits either originally or on appeal While dealing with the argument at the <ORG> complaining of the unsoundness of the conclusions reached by the magistrates and the hardships to be caused by their erroneous order the Court made the following observations which are very apposite to the facts and circumstances disclosed in the instant appeals and which all courts entrusted with the duty of administering law should bear in mind so that they may not be deflected from the straight path of enforcing the law by considerations based on hardship or on vague I Queen Bench English Reports I In that case their Lord<NAME> of <ORG> held that a conviction by a magistrate for a non indictable offence cannot be quashed on certiorari on the ground that the record showed that there was no evidence to support the conviction or that the magistrate had misdirected himself in considering the evidence Lord <NAME> began his judgment by observing that the point involved in the case was of the very greatest importance which had necessitated the examination of a large number of cases and consideration of the principles which apply to the doctrine of certiorari The Lord Chief Justice then pointed out that the examination of the authorities bearing on the exercise of the power of certiorari yielded the result that it was open to <ORG> to examine the record and to see whether or not there was an error of law apparent on the face of the record The other Lord Justice who took part in the hearing of the appeal <NAME> also examined that question and concluded as follows It is plain that certiorari will not issue as the cloak of an appeal in disguise fore this <ORG> that an error of fact even though apparent on the face of the record could be a ground for interference by the court exercising its writ jurisdiction The principle underlying the jurisdiction to issue a writ or order of certiorari is no more in doubt but the real difficulty arises as it often does in applying the principle to the particular facts of a given case In the judgments and orders impugned in these appeals <ORG> has exercised its supervisory jurisdic note in respect of errors which cannot be said to be errors of law apparent on the face of the record Section of the Act gives it the power to pass such orders as it thought fit For example it has been said that <ORG> did not observe the instructions that tribal people have to be given certain preferences or that persons on the debarred list like smugglers should be kept out see of the Manual But all these are only Executive Instructions which have no statutory force After having dealt with the common arguments more or less applicable to all the cases it remains to consider the special points raised on behalf of the respondents in Civil Appeal No of relating to the Tinsukia country spirit shop It was strenuously argued that the appeal was incompetent in view of the fact that the rule issued by <ORG> was still pending and that this <ORG> does not ordinarily entertain an appeal against an interlocutory order We heard the learned counsel for the respondents at great length as to whether he could justify the continuance of this undesirable and unfortunate state of affairs After having heard both sides we have come to the conclusion that no grounds have been made out for interference by <ORG> under its powers under arts We do not find any grounds in the orders of <ORG> which could attract the supervisory jurisdiction of <ORG> there being no error of law apparent on the face of the record or a defect of jurisdiction in the <ORG> whose orders have been impugned in the <ORG> We would however like to make it clear that we are interfering with the interlocutory order passed by <ORG> in this case because of its unusual and exceptional features It is clear that our decision on the main points urged in the other appeals necessarily leads to the inference that even if all the allegations made by the respondents in their petition before the Assam <ORG> are accepted as true there would be no case whatever for issuing a rule Indeed the respondent found it difficult to resist the appellant argument that if the other appeals were allowed on the general contentions raised by the appellants the dismissal of his petition before the Assam <ORG> would be a foregone conclusion As a result of these considerations the appeals must be allowed and the orders passed by <ORG> in the several cases set aside On the question of costs we direct that the appellants in each case should get their costs here and in <ORG> except the appellant in Civil Appeal No who has failed on the main point raised on his behalf and who therefore must bear his own costs
