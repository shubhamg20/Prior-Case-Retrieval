HEADNOTE Appellant No was a company engaged in the business of manufacturing different types of glass viz The Assistant Collector of Central Excise rejected the claim for refund and the appellants there upon filed a Writ petition in <ORG> on September but the same was withdrawn as a <ORG>al Appeal filed by the appellants was pending with the Collector The appellants thereupon filed a Writ Petition in <ORG> and assailed the order In the appeal to this Court on the question I whether the appellants are resettled to claim refund of excess excise duty paid prior to February and whether they are entitled to claim refund of such duty paid between A October and February or during any shorter period and whether the appellants are entitled to claim such refund in respect of all the goods iii <ORG>s have power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to make consequential orders for repayment of money realised by Government without the authority of law under Article of the Constitution While there are different periods of limitation prescribed for the institution of different kinds of suits by the Limitation Act there is no such period prescribed by law in respect of petitions filed under Article of the Constitution Where a petitioner who could have availed of the alternative remedy by way of suit approaches <ORG> under Article it is appropriate ordinarily to construe that any unexplained delay in filing of the writ petition after the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for filing a suit as unreasonable Each case has to be judged on its own facts and circumstances touching the conduct of the parties the change in situation the prejudice which is likely to be caused to the opposite party or to the general public All such excess payments made on or after September which would fall within the period of three years prior to the date on which the first writ petition was filed should have been ordered to be refunded under Article But <ORG> declined to do so Though the appellant should not be granted any relief in respect of payment made between October and September which would fall beyond the three years from the date of the first writ petition it is not proper and just to negative the claim in respect of excess payments made after September While the earlier order may not be a legal bar to the contention raised by the appellants on February that wired glass was not taxable under tariff Item A but under tariff Item after that date it is certainly a circumstance which disentitles the appellants to claim refund of excess duty paid by them in a petition under Article The Judgment of the Court Was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH This appeal by special leave is filed against the judgment and order dated November of <ORG> in Special Civil Application No of filed under Article of the Constitution Appellant No I is a company which is engaged in the business of manufacturing different types of glass viz On February the appellants applied for the refund of excess duty paid by them from October upto the date of the application on the ground that the item of glass in question were distinct commercial goods known in the market as figured glass wired glass coloured figured glass rolled glass coolex figured glass and coolex wired glass and could not be described in common parlance as sheet glass mentioned in Item A and that since they did not fall under any of the Items to in the First Schedule to the Act they could only be subjected to levy of excise duty under the residuary provision Item in that Schedule after it was inserted in it All other goods not one per cent ad elsewhere specified valorem manufactured in a factory but excluding a alcohol all sorts including alcoholic liquors for human consumption Against the said order of the Assistant Collector the appellants filed a writ petition in Special Civil Application No of The said petition was admitted but when it was taken up for Final hearing it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that since the appellants had also filed an appeal against the very same order before the Collector of <ORG> they could not pursue the remedy under Article of the Constitution as it stood then The said order in revision was challenged before <ORG> by the appellants under Article of the Constitution The <ORG> was further directed to review the relevant assessments accordingly for the period subsequent to February and to refund any excess duty that might after such review be found to be refundable to the appellants The appellants have filed this appeal by special leave only as regards the rejection by <ORG> of their prayer for refund of excess duty paid by them prior to February The question which arise for consideration in this appeal are therefore I whether the appellants are entitled to claim refund of excess excise duty which had been paid by them prior of February and if so whether they are entitled to claim refund of such duty paid between October and February or during any shorter period and whether the appellants are entitled to claim such refund in respect of all the goods in question Since it is convenient to dispose of the second question at this stage we shall take it up first These facts distinguish the case in respect of wired glass from the case in respect of the other goods While the said earlier order may not be a legal bar to the contention raised by the appellants on February that wired glass was not taxable under tariff Item A but under tariff Item after that date it is certainly a circumstance which disentitles the appellants to claim refund of excess duty paid by them in a petition under Article of the Constitution on a ground contrary to their earlier stand In regard to the relief of refund of excess duty paid in respect of the other goods the case stands on an entirely different footing No efforts also was made in the course of the arguments urged on behalf of the appellants to establish it But the appellants instead of filing a suit first filed a writ petition in Special Civil Application No of on September and that petition had to be withdrawn in view of clause of Article of the Constitution as it stood then because the alternative remedy by way of an appeal was available The appellants could therefore file the writ petition out of which the appeal arises only after the disposal of the revision petition by <ORG> as mentioned earlier lt is not disputed that <ORG>s have power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to make consequential orders for repayment of money realised by the <ORG> without the authority of law under Article of the Constitution While there are different periods of limitation prescribed for the institution of different kinds of suits by the limitation Act there is no such period prescribed by law in respect of petitions filed under Article of the Constitution Where a petitioner who could have availed of the alternative remedy by way of suit approaches <ORG> under Article of the Constitution i is appropriate ordinarily to construe that any unexplained delay in the filing of the writ petition after the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for filing a suit as unreasonable There may also be cases where there may be circumstances which may persuade the court to grant relief even though the petition may have been filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed for a suit Each case has to judged on its own facts and circumstance touching the conduct of the parties the change in situation the prejudice which is likely to be caused to the opposite party or to the general public etc Hence even granting that on the date of making each payment of excise duty in excess of the proper duty payable under law the appellants should be deemed to have discovered the mistake all such excess payments made on and after September which would fall within the period of three years prior to the date on which Special Civil Application No of was filed should have been ordered to be refunded under Article of the Constitution While we do agree that the appellants should not be granted any relief in respect of payment made between October and September which would fall beyond three years from the date of the first writ petition filed in this case we do not find it proper and just to negative the claim of the appellants in respect of excess payments made after September The appeal is accordingly allowed in part
