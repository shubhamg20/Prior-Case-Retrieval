HEADNOTE Owing to the very low cotton crop there was unprecedented and phenomenal rise in cotton prices and there was a perceptible drop in yarn production The same notification contained another direction under powers conferred by cl a of the order that every producer of yarn for civil consumption shall sell or deliver such yarn only to five channels of distribution mentioned therein on the basis of the directions that might be issued from time to time by the Textile Commissioner Those five channels were a the nominees of the <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> Madras <ORG> Bombay <ORG> Bombay and any other person as may be nominated by the Textile Commissioner in this behalf In a petition under article of the Constitution of India the petitioners questioned the validity of the two notifications on the following grounds the Order in so far as it purported to make provisions ill respect of control and distribution of cotton yarn by fixation of prices more particularly by clauses and thereof was ultra vires the powers conferred on the Central <ORG> by of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act inasmuch as cotton yarn was not covered by the item Cotton and Woollen textiles and could not be brought within any other item ii in any event the provisions of the Order relating to cotton yarn could not be said to have been continued in force either under of the Essential Commodities Ordinance or under of the Essential Commodities Act as cotton yarn is not covered the item cotton and woollen textiles under a iv A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the <ORG> that the petitions were not competent because of the Proclamation of Emergency The validity of the impugned orders is challenged under articles and of the Constitution on the ground that it is a pre emergency executive order which could have been challenged under Article and before the proclamation of emergency If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit there is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on business If the prices of yarn or cloth are fixed in such a way as to enable the manufacturer In determining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are alleging loss after the imposition of the law will not render the law unreasonable The control of prices may have effect either on maintaining or increasing supply of commodity or securing equitable distribution and availability at fair prices The controlled price has to retain this equilibrium in the supply and demand of the commodity The producer must have an incentive to produce In fixing the prices a price line has to be held in order to give preference or predominant consideration to the interest of the consumer or the general public over that of the producer in respect of essential commodities The aspect of ensuring availability of the essential commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important consideration He may have to bear loss in the same way as he does when he suffers losses on account of economic forces operating on the business There is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to boarding or cornering or artificial short supply Any restriction in excess of what would be necessary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil has to be very carefully considered that the producer does The mere suggestion that no provision is made for adjustment on account of changes in the cost of production does not amount to infringement of fundamental right to carry on business and to hold and dispose of property There is no material to show that increase in yam prices was on account of cost of production Further even if there is increase in the cotton prices the petitioners can absorb it because the controlled price fixed is more fair to the producer It is not that all dealers in yarn have been denied the right to carry on trade JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos of There was unprecedented and phenomenal rise in cotton prices There was a perceptible drop in yarn production There was rise in prices There was of course a prolonged labour strike in February March in Coimbatore and for a short period elsewhere in Tamil Nadu There was a marked fall in production in that State The mills in North India were of the view that prices of coarse and medium counts had not gone up appreciably as compared with the pool prices and were either steady or even lower in some cases than those at the comme ncement of and therefore there was no case whatever for subjecting them to control Second the manufacturers of yarn shall sell only to nominees of the Textile Commissioner The second impugned notification is made by the Textile Commissioner in exercise of powers conferred under clause of the Order The same notification contained another direction under powers conferred by clause a of the Order that every producer of yarn for civil consumption shall sell or deliver such yarn only to channels of distribution mentioned therein on the basis of the directions that might be issued from time to time by the Textile Commissioner Those channels are a the nominees of <ORG> <ORG> Madras <ORG> Bombay <ORG> Bombay and any other person as may be nominated by the Textile Commissioner in this behalf more particularly by clauses and thereof is ultra vires the powers conferred on <ORG> by Section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act hereinafter referred to as the Act inasmuch as cotton yam is not covered by the item Cotton and woollen textiles and cannot be brought within any other item Clause of the Order confers power on the Textile Commissioner to issue directions to manufacturer regarding the classes or specifications of cloth or yarn which manu facturer shall or shall not manufacture Clause confers power on the Textile Commissioner to specify the maximum prices at which any class or specification of cloth or yarn may be sold Clause confer power on the Textile Commissioner with a view to securing a proper distribution of cloth or yarn to issue directions to any manufacturer or dealer to sell or deliver specified quantities of cloth or yarn to specified persons a fabric made by weaving a woven fabric or a material suitable for weaving textile material There are also decisions of Courts which accepted yarn to be within textile There is cognate legislation which treated yarn as cotton textile The second contention on behalf of the petitioners is that in any event the provisions of the Order relating to cotton yarn cannot be said to have been continued in force either under section of the Essential Commodities Ordinance or under section of the Essential Commodities Act hereinafter referred to as the Act as cotton yarn is not covered by the item Cotton and woollen textiles under section a iv of the Act and no notification had been issued declaring cotton yarn as an essential commodity in exercise of powers conferred under section a xi of the Act Section of Act provided notwithstanding anything contained in the Government of India Act the Indian <ORG> shall have power to make laws with respect to trade and commerce whether or not within a province in and production supply and distribution of cotton and woollen textile paper products petroleum and petroleum products spare parts of mechanically propelled vehicles coal iron steel The notification fixing maximum price of cotton yarn and cloth under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control Order also continued until January There was no power to control price of yarn and cloth There was only power to control quantities and specification of cloth and yam From to there was control of distribution and price of cloth and yarn by various notifications issued under Cotton Textiles Control Order The objects and reasons of the Act were that under Article of the Constitution <ORG> had power for a period of five years from the commencement of the Constitution to make laws with respect to trade and com merce in and production supply and distribution of certain essential commodities On October a notification was issued under section xi of the Essential Commodities Act declaring commodities specified therein used in the process of manufacturing yarn and machinery for manufacturing cloth Such orders could provide for Control of prices of essential commodities and require any person holding stock to sell Whole or specified part at such prices and to such persons as specified in the Order The Act also contains similar power to control the prices at which essential commodities may be bought or sold or to require any person holding stock of essential commodity to sell the whole or specified part to <ORG> or <ORG> or other persons mentioned therein The amended clause a is that the textile Commissioner may with a view to securing proper distribution of cloth or yarn and with a view to securing compliance with the provisions of this Order direct any manufacturer or dealer class of manufacturers or dealers a to sell or deliver specified quantities of cloth or yarn to specified persons not to sell or deliver cloth or yarn or specified description except to specified persons and subject to such conditions as the Textile Commissioner may specify The amended clause further provided that the manufacturers or dealers shall comply with the directions and the Textile Commissioner in making orders shall have regard to the requirements of categories of persons mentioned in sub clause a the availability of cloth or yam of different descriptions and the requirement of any local area Clause of the Order provided that any person aggrieved by an order of the Textile Commissioner may prefer an appeal to <ORG> within thirty days of the date of communication of such Order and the decision of <ORG> thereon shall be final The fourth contention is that if the provisions of the Cotton Textiles Control Order confer arbitrary power on <ORG> to fix prices for yarn unrelated to the cost of production and reasonable profits to the producer then the provisions become void by reason of infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles and and as well as Article of the Constitution The question of fair price of cotton textile in the sphere of trade engaged the attention of the Government in With regard to ceiling or maximum price it has to be balanced between a reasonable margin over and above cost of producer on the one hand and on the other the interest and protection of the consumer because a liberal ceiling will ordinarily not encourage sales at below the maximum price though there is no bar to sales below the maximum price If the price of raw material is controlled but not of the commodity which can be produced in place of that raw material there would be danger of production being diverted to channels over which there is no control For yarn upto counts and below there was no price rise upto December over the period of preceding months Therefore there is basic variation between December And March in cotton There is total non application of mind to arrive at the price by an alternative method The price fixed under the impugned orders is for a long time There is a provision of appeal to <ORG> against the order of the Textile Commissioner The rice millers contended that notification fixing fair price violated Articles and of the Constitution and therefore they were entitled to the rates prevailing in the market This Court will not substitute its determination for that of the discretion of the authority in fixing the fair prices The Controller with a view to fixing maximum price of iron and steel made a flat reduction of Rs Clause of the Non ferrous Metal Control Order which provided that no person shall sell or offer to sell any non ferrous metal at a price which exceeds the amount represented by an addition of per cent of its landed cost and which provided that no person shall purchase or offer to purchase from any person nonferrous metal at a price higher than at which it is permissible for that other person to sell the same under sub clause was challenged In considering the provisions of Coal Control Order this Court said that a law or order which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the executive in the mater of regulating trade or business in normally available commodities cannot be held to be un reasonable <NAME> The two decisions on which the petitioners relied are <ORG> That subsection relates to sugar and there are special features for fixing of price In <ORG> case supra it is said that fair price of sugar is to be determined ensuring to the industry a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar but the Government cannot fix any arbitrary price or fix it on extraneous considerations or fix such price that it does not secure a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry In sub section of section it is stated that without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section a notified order made thereunder may provide for controlling the price at which any such article is bought or sold In <ORG> case supra this <ORG> said that the concept of fair price fixed under section takes in all the elements to make it fair for the consumer leaving a reasonable margin of profit to the manufacturer without which no one will engage in any manufacturing activity These observations were made on the basis of the agreement of the parties there that irrespective of technicaL or legal points the <ORG> should base its judgment on examination of correct and rational principle and should direct deviation from the report of <ORG> appointed by it with the concurrence of the parties only when it is shown that there has been a departure from the established principles or the conclusions of the <ORG> are shown to be demonstrably wrong or erroneous If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit there is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on business by imposing reasonable restrictions If the prices of yarn or cloth are fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer to recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit no aspect of infringement of fundamental right can be said to arise In determining the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law in the field of industry trade It was also said Suffice it to say that since <ORG> fixed the quotas on a historical basis it is not for this <ORG> to reweigh the relevant fac tors and perchance substitute its notion of expediency and fairness for that of <ORG> Sub section provides that where an order under section of the Act is made requiring any person holding any stock to sell to the <ORG> or to any officer or to any class of person the price under sub section can be fixed a by an agreement consistent with controlled price or if there is no agreement with reference to controlled price or the market price where neither of the two courses is possible Subsection A applies when there is a notification in <ORG> that notwithstanding anything contained in sub section the price shall be regulated in the case of foodstuff in accordance With the provisions of sub section A In sub section it is stated that where either there is no notification under sub section A or any such notification has ceased to remain in force by efflux of time the contingencies mentioned therein will happen Subsections and A speak of fixing price by agreement consistent with or with reference to controlled price or failing both market rate prevailing in the locality during three months preceding the date of the notification The control of prices may have effect either on maintaining or in The controlled price has to retain this equilibrium in the supply and demand of the commodity The producer must have an incentive to produce In fixing the prices a price line lids to be held in order to give preference or predominant consideration to the interest of the consumer or the general public over that of the producers in respect of essential commodities The aspect of ensuring availability of the essential commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important consideration He may have to bear in the same way he does when he suffers losses on account of economic forces operating in the business If an essential commodity is in short supply or there is hoarding cornering or there is unsual demand there is abnormal increase in price There is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to hoarding or cornering or artificial short supply The controlled price will enable both the consumer and the producer to tide over difficulties Therefore any restriction in excess of what would be necessary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil has to be very carefully considered so that the producer does not perish and the consumer is not crippled The petitioners contended that the control over prices of yarn in relation to ex mill prices would not serve the purpose of control because there is no control over retail prices In specifying the maximum price the factors to be taken into consideration are a invoiced price of yarn incidental charges including transport and local taxes such reasonable margin of profit not exceeding two per cent of the invoiced price as may be determined in each case and any other relevant factor In counts of yarns of and below there was no increase of price for months ending December The benefit of one half of the price increases which took place between January June on account of factors which do not enter into determining the cost of production have also been taken into consideration The mere suggestion that no provision is made for adjustment on account of changes in the cost of production does not amount to infringement of fundamental right to carry on business and to hold and dispose of property There is no material to show that increase in yarn prices was on account of cost of production Further even if there is increase in the cotton prices the petitioners can absorb it because the controlled price fixed is more fair to the producer The impugned orders are made in exercise of powers conferred by clause a of the Cotton Textiles Order There is thus price control as well as distribution control to meet the problems of availability of goods at reasonable prices The seventh contention of the petitioners as well as the interveners was that the impugned orders requiring the producer to deliver yarn only to the five channels of distribution mentioned therein created monopoly in favour of specified persons and therefore there was violation of Articles and and of the Constitution It was also said that there was no obligation on the distribution channels to buy from the mills Counsel on behalf of the traders who intervened submitted that there was no justification for canalisation of the goods because it was not in public interest and it was a total ban on traders It was also said that there would be neither equitable distribution nor availability of goods because the order did not provide that it would reach the weavers and the order also did not provide that the agencies were to sell at specified rates any other person as may be nominated by the Textile Commissioner was attacked on the ground that there was no classification and it conferred arbitrary power of choice The order states that such power is required to be exercised with a view to securing proper distribution of cloth or yarn There is no control over distribution of this yarn it is not that all dealers in yarn have been denied the right to carry on trade The petitioners contend that though the order obliges producers of yarn to sell to persons named there is no obligation on those persons to buy and therefore it is an unreasonable restriction There were cases where the allottees did not lift the goods when the voluntary scheme was in operation In the past at the initial stages of the voluntary control scheme <ORG> nominees were not adequately financially equipped and that is why there were cases of non lifting of yarn it was said on behalf of the <ORG> that the petitions were not maintainable because of the proclamation of emergency The validity of the impugned orders is challenged under Article and of the Constitution on the ground that it is a pre emergency executive order which could have been challenged under Article and before the proclamation of emergency
