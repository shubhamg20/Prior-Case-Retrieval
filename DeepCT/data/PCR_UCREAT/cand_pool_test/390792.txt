That section does not assist the appellants for there is a proviso that in trials by Jury the <ORG> need not write a judgment but the <ORG> of Session should record the heads of the charge to the Jury There is nothing there as to when it must be written as in the case of a judgment by the <ORG> dealt with in a preceding part of the section Whilst therefore there is nothing in the point to assist the appellants we think it is very unsatisfactory that the charge to the Jury was not in the case before us written out until the th June nearly three weeks after the sentence The first point of misdirection is that the Judge did not read the medical evidence to the Jury but one has only to look at the charge to see that there were frequent references to the medical evidence There is nothing that makes it incumbent upon any Judge to read the whole of the depositions of the witnesses to the Jury and we think in the present case the medical evidence was sufficiently attracted to their attention Then it is said that the Judge did not sufficiently warn the Jury that the omission of the prosecution to call certain witnesses and particularly the palki bearers raised a presumption that their evidence would be unfavourable to the prosecution and reference is made to Section Ill There is no substance in this point But it appears from a note made by the Judge that in the charge to the Jury they were told that if the five persons went in a body with the common object of murdering <NAME> and if he was killed in the prosecution of that common object then no matter which of them struck the blow or blows which caused death all would be equally guilty of murder under Section read with Section of the Indian Penal Code There only remains the question whether the <ORG> below was wrong in admitting oral evidence of a statement made to the police by a witness to corroborate that witness deposition at the trial In the former it was held that the general provisions of Section of the Indian Evidence Act of were overridden by the special provisions of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure In that of Section enacted No statement so reduced into writing shall be signed by the person making it nor shall it be treated as part of the record or used as evidence Section of the Code of on the other hand was thus expressed No statement other than a dying declaration made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if reduced to writing be signed by the person making it or be used as evidence against the accused The present Section provides that No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if taken down in writing be signed by the person making it nor shall such writing be used as evidence Section of the Criminal Procedure Code now in force enacts that if any such statement as is now under consideration is taken down in writing the writing cannot be used as evidence We may add that we have not overlooked the proviso to the present section but that is confined to and for the benefit of the defence as the prosecution have free access to all the police papers There is nothing therefore in the special provision of the existing Code to over ride the general provisions of the Evidence Act as to the proof by oral evidence of former statements consequently the oral evidence here objected to was rightly admitted by the lower <ORG> We may add that apart from this there is sufficient evidence on the record to sustain the conviction
