The cycle rickshaw man swerved to left to avoid him and on hearing the noise it made by swerving he applied brakes it went or feet and stopped before it stopped the deceased tripped over to the front wheel of the motor cycle His knees hit the wheel and he fell to his right face upwards on the road In such an event if he had fallen he could not have sustained such serious injuries as to cause his death The second discrepancy pointed out by the learned Counsel is that according to there was no heavy traffic at the time of the accident while according to there was a heavy traffic at that time The answer of as to there being heavy traffic comes after the witness had spoken to the accident having taken place and the deceased having been iniured The next argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellant is with regard to the quantum of compensation awarded by the tribunal The <ORG> on the appreciation of the evidence placed before him came to the conclusion that the deceased was aged at the time of the accident that he had already retired as a Junior Superintendent of <ORG> department and that a portion of his pension of Rs and under those circumstances it could not be said that he was giving anything to the respondents so as to warrant the respondents contending that the death of <NAME> caused any loss of benefit to them Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel for the respondents drew my attention to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> AC Mr <NAME> drew my attention to the following passage in the judgment of Viscount Simon in the above case The question thus resolves itself into that of fixing a reasonable figure to be paid by way of damages for the loss of a measure of prospective happiness Such a problem might seem more suitable for discussion in an easy or Artistotelian ethics than in the judgment of a Court of law but in view of the earlier authorities we must do our best to contribute to its solution I would rather say that before damages are awarded in respect of the shortened life of a given individual under this head it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that the circumstances of the individual life were calculated to lead on balance to a positive measure of happiness of which the victim has been deprived by the defendant negligence II the character or habits of the individual were calculated to lead him to a future of unhappiness or despondency that would be a circumstance justifying a smaller award it is significant that at any rate in one case of which we were informed the Jury refused to award any damages under this head at all As Lord <NAME> said in <NAME> <NAME> AC special cases suggest themselves where the termination of a life of constant pain and suffering cannot be regarded as inflicting injury or at any rate as inflicting the same injury as in more normal cases I would further lay it down that in assessing damages for this purpose the question is not whether the deceased had the capacity or ability to appreciate that his further life on earth would bring him happiness The test is not subjective and the right sum to award depends on the objective estimate of what kind of future on earth the victim might have enjoyed whether he had justly estimated that future or not Of course no regard must be had to financial losses or gains during the period of which the victim has been deprived The learned Judge after referring to those decisions stated as follows There is now no difficulty in stating the principles that should weigh with the <ORG> in awarding damages under this head of loss of expectation of life particularly after the classical pronouncement of Viscount <NAME> in <NAME> case Under these circumstances I hold that there are no merits in this appeal and the same is dismissed with costs
