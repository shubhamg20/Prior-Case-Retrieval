of the Constitution seeking to challenge the validity of note to rule of the Mysore civil services Rules hereinafter called the rules framed by the Governor of Mysore in exercise of his powers under the proviso to Art The points raised by them are common and so we would mention the facts in Writ Petition No of and deal with that petition on the merits On July he was served with a notice issued by <ORG> informing him that <ORG> considered it was necessary in the public interest to retire him from service under note to rule of the rules and notice was accordingly given to him intimating to him that he will be retired as from November The petitioner contends that under rule a he was entitled to remain in service until he completed years of age which means that he would have retired in normal course on May It appears that after the notice was served on the petitioner he made a representation to the <ORG> through proper channel The <ORG> however was not impressed by the plea made by the petitioner and on November a final order was passed terminating the petitioner service from November Rule a of the rules undoubtedly provides that the date of superannuation of a <ORG> servant is the date on which he attains the age of years and it authorizes the <ORG> to retain the <ORG> servant in service even after the date of superannuation if the said servant is physically fit and if the continuance of the said <ORG> servant in service is found to be on public grounds In such a case the grounds of public interest had to be mentioned in the order and the servant may be continued until he attains the age of years Rule deals with retiring pension and it provides that a retiring pension is granted to a <ORG> servant who is permitted to retire after completing qualifying service for thirty years or such less time as may for any special class of <ORG> servants be prescribed Note to this rule provides inter alia that <ORG> may in special cases require any <ORG> servant to retire any time after he has completed years qualifying service or on attaining years of age if such retirement is considered necessary in the public interest provided that the appropriate authority shall give in this behalf a notice in writing to the <ORG> servant at least three months before the date on which he is required to retire In other words ordinarily retirement by superannuation occurs after attaining years or completing years service while premature retirement can be forced on the <ORG> servant if he has either completed years of service or has attained years of age Sri <NAME> contends that this rule is invalid because it contravenes Art Recently a Special Bench of this Court had occasion to consider the validity of rules and contained in the Indian Railway Establishment Code in Moti Ram Deka <ORG> Civil Appeals Nos to of and to of dated December LLJ In dealing with the problem raised in that case this Court has made it perfectly clear that so far as the question of compulsory retirement is concerned it must be taken to be concluded by several decisions of this Court Sri <NAME> however attempted to argue that there are certain observations made by this Court in the case of General Manager could not be accepted because it would lead to anomalous results It is obvious that these observations have no relevance to the point with which we are concerned in the present petition It is true that in his petition the petitioner has made certain allegations against the Home Minister <NAME> and has suggested that the order terminating his services prematurely is due to his whims and fancies and he has characterized the said order as both arbitrary and illegal The allegations made by the petitioner in that behalf are very vague and unsatisfactory and so it would be idle to contend that if the impugned note is valid the order terminating the services of the petitioner can still be challenged on the ground that it is not justified on the merits or is illegal or arbitrary
