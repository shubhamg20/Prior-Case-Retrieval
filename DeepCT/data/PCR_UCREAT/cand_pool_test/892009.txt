His contention is that cases under the Act must be dealt with in accordance with the special procedure prescribed by the Act and that there is no provision in it for a review of judgment either on a certificate from the Advocate General or otherwise The Act however does not profess to lay down complete rules of procedure the ordinary procedure has to be followed except in so far as it is modified by the Act there is nothing in the Act to modify the ordinary procedure in this particular respect Clause of the Letters Patent gives power to the High <ORG> on the Advocate General certificate to review in every case mentioned in Clause of the Letters Patent i in any criminal trial before the courts of original criminal jurisdiction which may be constituted by one or more of the Judges of the said High <ORG> The points of law which are certified as requiring further consideration are stated as follows in the certificate of the Advocate General That in my judgment the opinion of the learned Judges that while the statements made by a parson to a Police Officer in the course of an investigation and taken down in writing may not be proved by the production of the writing they may be proved by oral evidence requires to be further considered They have also given evidence of meetings of the society at Tenkasi and Tuticorin and elsewhere attended by the accused and there is no question but that if the accused were present at these meetings and took the blood oath as alleged by the approvers they are guilty The questions of law that have been raised relate to the legal validity of an accomplice evidence if uncorroborated and to the admissibility and legal effect of certain statements made by two of the accomplices <NAME> and <NAME> in this case prior to the trial was searched the next day and he in like manner made a statement to <NAME> which was Recorded by him At the trial before <ORG> which began in the following September and went on for some months <NAME> and <NAME> were examined as witnesses for the prosecution and gave evidence as already stated involving not only their own guilt but also the guilt of several of the accused who took the blood oath at the treasonable meetings held at Tenkasi and Tuticorin They also called the Inspector <NAME> to give evidence of the statements made to him by the accomplices I will now turn to the five points of law which the Advocate General certifies should be further considered The substantive provision of the Indian code law is contained in Section of the Indian Evidence Act which in explicit terms declares that An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice But the court shall also have regard to such facts as the following in considering whether such maxim does or does not apply to the particular case before them A a person of the highest character is tried for causing a man death by an act of negligence in arranging certain machinery a person of equally good character who also took part in the arrangement describes precisely what was done and admits and explains the common carelessness of A and himself And again a crime is committed by several persons In my opinion there is nothing in the illustration to Section which over rides or renders nugatory the plain and explicit declaration contained in Section or which requires us to hold that the evidence of an accomplice must always and in all circumstances be regarded as unworthy of credit unless it is corroborated in material particulars or which requires us to hold that it is not open to the court to act on such evidence even when the court believes it to be perfectly true It styles the presumption a maxim not a rule of law and says but the court shall also have regard to certain facts in considering whether such maxim does or does not apply to the particular case before it It then refers to the case of a person of the highest character giving evidence of an offence committed by the negligence of himself and another person of equally high character The witness is an accomplice and he is not corroborated in any particular still less in material particulars yet the court should have regard to various circumstances viz But it is also his duty to refer to any circumstances or facts such as those referred to in the illustrations to Section which show that the presumption should not be drawn in the particular case or which rebut the presumption if drawn and he should instruct them that if having scrutinized the evidence of the accomplice with care and caution and having considered it in the light of the circumstances in which it was given and all other circumstances tending to show its truth or falsehood they believe it to be true they should act upon it even though there may be no corroboration of it in the strict sense of the word but that if they are not satisfied of its truth they should refuse to act upon it In my opinion they have correctly stated the law as laid down in the Indian Evidence Act and in the Indian and English cases quoted by them Reg The suggestion made in the latter part of the Advocate General first point if I understand it aright is that the presumption of untrustworthiness must always and in all circumstances first be drawn and the evidence cannot in any case be acted upon unless special circumstances are found which rebut the presumption Section speaks simply of facts not special circumstances and the caution attached to illustration merely says the court shall also have regard to such facts as the following not special facts or special circumstances That clause is as follows on its being certified by the said Advocate General that in his judgment there is an error in the decision of a point or points of law decided by the court of original criminal jurisdiction or that a point or points of law which has or have been decided by the said court should be further considered the said <ORG> shall have full power and authority to review the case or such part of it as may be necessary and finally determine such point or points of law and thereupon to alter the sentence passed by the court of original jurisdiction and to pass such judgment and sentence as to the said <ORG> shall seem right I do not think that these words can be held to open up the whole case as if op appeal for Clause enacts that there shall be no appeal When the case has reached that stage then the court has to be guided by Section of the Indian Evidence Act which enacts that the improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case if it shall appear to the court before which such objection is raised that independently of the evidence objected to and admitted there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision or that if the rejected evidence had been received it ought not to have varied the decision The law on the subject is contained in Section of the Indian Evidence Act which reproduces in a simplified form the provision in Section of Act II of and enacts that In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness any former statement made by such witness relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact may be proved This section which differs widely from the English law expressly states that a former statement made by a witness may if made under the conditions stated in the section be proved in order to corroborate the evidence of the witness at the trial I do not think that there is anything in the Indian Evidence Act to exclude the evidence of accomplices from the plain and express rule in Section nor can it be suggested that corroborate is used in Section in a different sense from that in which it is used in illustration to Section The former statement of an accomplice is therefore legally admissible to corroborate his testimony at the trial and the weight to be attached to it or in other words how far it does really corroborate the evidence given at the trial must vary with the facts of each case In the great majority of cases it would no doubt be found to be merely the repetition of tainted evidence affording no ground for believing it to be true and therefore adding nothing whatever to its value On the other hand if there was evidence or even a suggestion put forward by the defence that the evidence given by the witness at the trial was the result of recent influences brought to bear upon him it would be most important to be able to prove that the witness had made statements to the same effect as his evidence at the trial long before the influences relied on by the defence had been brought to bear upon him If the prosecution proposed to corroborate that evidence by proof of a former statement made months after his arrest and when the police had collected their other evidence and had in fact completed the scheme of the case to be proved against the accused it is obvious that the former statement would add no strength to would be no real corroboration at all of the evidence of the witness at the trial But is not the case very different when as was found by the majority of <ORG> it appears that <NAME> first told the same story at a time and under such circumstances as to entirely negative the idea that it was either falsely concocted by himself or suggested to him by the police when it appears that the story told was not what the police wanted at that time nor was such as was supported by the evidence then in their hands nor was such as would have been concocted by <NAME> either of his own motion or in consultation with <NAME> or <NAME> if he was anxious to protect himself or them from prosecution for complicity with <NAME> in the murder of Mr <NAME> nor was such as <NAME> previous relations with the persons then named would render probable It is not unreasonable to say that those and similar matters referred to by the majority of <ORG> ought not to have been considered in judging whether <NAME> was a truthful witness or not So too if there was reason to think that owing to the lapse of time the memory of a witness at the time of the trial could not be wholly relied on the fact that he had made a statement to the same effect when the facts were fresh in his memory would be highly relevant in corroboration of the evidence at the trial means the latter I do not think that the question is one that arises in this case those made before <NAME> and before Mr <NAME> and before the Committing Magistrate the prolonged cross examination did not succeed in breaking down the evidence of any of the three approvers and they conclude by saying we do not consider that there is anything in the evidence of the witnesses inconsistent with its substantial truth It will be seen that they were acquitted not because the approvers were found to be intentionally giving false evidence against them but because there was a doubt in each case as to whether the accused was the person really referred to by the approver as present at the meetings We have already seen in dealing with the first point raised by the Advocate General that corroboration is not legally necessary if there are circumstances which lead the court to the conclusion that the witness though an accomplice is a truthful witness The question then whether the previous statement of an accomplice can legally amount to corroboration in material particulars of the evidence given at the trial within the meaning of illustration to Section is one that is not expressly raised by the certificate of the Advocate General nor do I think that it is one which it is necessary to consider in order to decide the questions raised by him or the correctness of the judgment of the majority of the Special Bench I have already shown how the former statements have been used in their judgment to corroborate the evidence of the witnesses given at the trial and I have expressed the opinion that they were admissible under Section and were properly used In the former it was said at page that the previous statement of an accomplice can scarcely be said to answer the purpose for which juries are advised by judges to require the evidence of an accomplice to be confirmed It is not necessary for us to consider whether the rule should be extended as far as to exclude a statement made before arrest but we have no doubt at all that the exact correspondence in details of several statements made by an approver in the course of a trial is not corroborative evidence such as we ordinarily require to make it safe to convict any particular prisoner If there are some circumstances in which a prior statement may amount to sufficient corroboration we cannot say as a matter of law that a prior statement can never be corroboration in material particulars though no doubt in the great majority of cases it will be found that the prior statements do not add anything to the credibility of the evidence given at the trial It may be stated at once that the admissibility or inadmissibility of those statements cannot make any difference in the decision of the present case since the majority of the Special Bench who admitted the statements expressly say that they find it impossible to believe that the statements were either tutored or concocted even if the witnesses statements to <NAME> are discarded and if regard is paid only to their statements recorded four and three days respectively later to the same effect by Mr <NAME> the Magistrate under Section Criminal Procedure Code the admissibility of which is not and cannot be disputed As however the questions are raised in the Advocate General certificate and are of great general importance I will state my opinion in regard to each of them I agree with the conclusion arrived at by all the Judges of <ORG> and for the reasons stated in their judgments The words in the Evidence Act are perfectly general competent to investigate the fact Can it be supposed for instance that a statement made before <ORG> relating to some fact the existence of which the court was legally competent to try and otherwise relevant under Section of the Indian Evidence Act in a subsequent criminal trial could be shut out on the ground that the word investigate would not include a trial by <ORG> I take it that the answer must be in the negative It is unfortunate that there was no adequate inquiry before <ORG> as to how far Inspector <NAME> was an authority legally competent to investigate the facts relating to the murder of Mr <NAME> I take it that conducting the searches was an integral part of the investigation and legal competency to conduct the searches carried with it legal competency to do all things properly incidental to and connected with the searches and included the listening to any statements relating to the murder or those who took part in it made by persons whose houses were being searched The Inspector was engaged in and upon the investigation of facts relating to Mr <NAME> murder and the statement was made to him by the person whose house was being searched and it was made as a matter relating to the murder Section of the Indian Evidence Act states that No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence The majority of <ORG> point out that in Section the confession when made not to a police officer but while in his custody is expressly made inadmissible only as against the person who made it but may be proved as against other persons and observes that as the mischief of the two sections is the same Section also should be understood as only excluding a confession made to a police officer from being used as against the person making it It certainly is difficult to see any satisfactory reason why the scope of the two sections should be different but that is hardly a sufficient reason for not construing each section so as to give effect to its plain language that a confession which is inadmissible against the person making it ought a fortiori to be inadmissible against another person implicated by it cited by Mr <NAME> for the prosecution is hardly an authority for his contention as the present question did not arise in that case Since writing the above I have had the advantage of perusing the judgments which my learned brothers <NAME> and <NAME> JJ I am much impressed by the force of the argument that may be drawn against my view from reasoning founded on the history of Sections to which were embodied first in the Code of Criminal Procedure of and afterwards transferred without material alteration to the Indian Evidence Act of but I am still inclined on the whole to the opinion that effect must be given to the language of Section and that it renders the statements of <NAME> and <NAME> to Inspector <NAME> inadmissible Reference was made to Clause conferring extraordinary original criminal jurisdiction on this <ORG> and it was contended that the accused before the <ORG> were not persons brought before it on charges preferred by the Advocate General or by any Magistrate or other officer specially empowered by the <ORG> in that behalf so as to come within that clause but were committed to this <ORG> for trial by a Magistrate acting under the powers conferred upon him by Section of Act XIV of They are before us and we have to satisfy ourselves in the first place as to what was actually decided by the majority or the full court as the case may be with reference to each of the points of law and as to whether the decision was erroneous As to this I am of opinion that the proposition that it would be open to the court to convict on the uncorreborated testimony of an accomplice in the sense and in the terms in which it is stated in the judgment of the majority of the Judges is correct and does not amount to an error in <NAME> To make this clearer still there is the additional provision But the Court shall also have regard to such facts as the following in considering whether such maxims do or do not apply to the particular case before it and then as to each of these maxims instances are given of facts in which the maxim is inapplicable and in the case of the maxim now in question there are two Such instances If the law was so laid down in the Act it was I have no doubt because it was the English law as understood at the time and had been the law ever since the decision of <NAME> case by the twelve Judges at the close of the th century Leach and because the draftsman and the legislature were not prepared with anything to substitute for it They were hot of course unaware of the well established practice of courts in England and India according to which to use the language of Sir <NAME> in Article of his Digest of the law of Evidence published in when the only proof against a person charged with a criminal offence is the evidence of an accomplice uncorroborated in any material particular it is the duty of the judge to warn the jury that it is unsafe to convict any person upon such evidence though they have a legal right to do so As regards the practice in India it has been observed that the danger of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices is even greater than in England and before the passing of the Indian Evidence Act it was held by a Full Bench of <ORG> in <NAME> case Criminal Rulings page on a review of the English authorities that a failure to direct the jury in accordance with the practice was a misdirection on which the conviction could be set aside They must however I think have contemplated that the law as declared rather than newly enacted in the section would continue to be applied under the safeguard of the practice and it is not I think surprising that the practice should have continued unaffected by the passing of the Act as appears from the Indian cases which are fully reviewed in the judgment of Mr Justice <NAME> The practice it must be borne in mind was one of advising the jury not to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice leaving it to them whether to follow the advice or not a liberty they undoubtedly possess under Section read with Section of the Indian Evidence Act Then if you believe it act on it even if there is no corroboration in the strict sense of the word If the alternative proposition as to special circumstances put forward in the certificate of the learned Advocate General means more than this and involves an enquiry as matter of law in each case whether there are special circumstances entitling the court to act on uncorroborated evidence I am unable to agree with it I am of opinion that in the judgment of the majority on this point there is no error of law entitling us to interfere Clause of the Letters Patent Reading the certificate with the judgment of the majority of the Court it appears to me that the question for our consideration is whether such previous statements if proved can be regarded as amounting to corroboration of the accomplice in material particulars which the meaning of Section illustration of the Indian Evidence Act as it is scarcely disputed that under Section such statements are admissible in corroboration I think that previous statements admissible as corroboration under Section of the Indian Evidence Act may or may not amount to sufficient corroboration and that whether they will be so or not depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case That previous statements may in some cases amount to corroboration where as in the present case there are the previous statements of several accomplices was pointed out in <NAME> case Crl Taken by itself the previous statement may of course be as tainted and untrustworthy as the evidence in the box and not supply any real corroboration but on the other hand the circumstances in which it was made may afford strong corroboration of its truthfulness apart from the credibility of the accomplice as in the case put by Sir <NAME> which has now been inserted as an illustration to Section of the Indian Evidence Act A crime is committed by several persons A and three of the criminals are captured on the spot and kept apart from each other It is true that they are given in the section rather as facts rendering corroboration unnecessary than as amounting themselves to corroboration but this it appears to me is a distinction which makes no real difference as the court is invited to believe the evidence and act upon it They have not in my opinion misdirected themselves at all in this respect and that being so we have no authority sitting here not as an appellate court but as a court of error under the Letters Patent to call in question the conclusions they have arrived at on evidence properly before them I do not think they can be taken as laying down as matter of law that previous statements of accomplices cannot amount to sufficient corroboration of their testimony and if they do I think they go too far A direction to that effect by a Sessions Judge was made the ground of an appeal against acquittal by the Bengal Government in Empress <NAME> but the case went off on another point It is not suggested that when the statements were made the Inspector was competent to investigate the charge of conspiracy a non cognizable offence on which the accused have been convicted but it was contended for the prosecution but denied for the defence that he was competent to investigate the murder of Mr <NAME> and that it was in the due course of that investigation that these statements were elicited Sections and deal with the corroboration of witnesses as to relevant facts and reading the two sections together I think Section should be read thus as if the words in brackets were there In order to corroborate the evidence of a witness as to a relevant fact any former statement made by the witness as to the same fact before any authority competent to investigate the fact may be proved It seems to me that under the section the evidence of witnesses in the box as to relevant facts may be corroborated by proof of previous statements as to the same facts if made before an authority legally competent to investigate such facts It cannot I think be questioned that an Inspector investigating the murder of Mr <NAME> was legally competent and bound in the course of his investigation to elicit the statements now in question and being so I think the provisions of the section were so far satisfied and that to make the previous statements admissible it was not necessary that the Inspector should have been legally competent to investigate the conspiracy of which the accused have been convicted As to whether the Inspector to whom the statements were made was in fact legally competent to investigate the murder of Mr <NAME> Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that any officer in charge of a police station may without the order of a magistrate investigate any cognizable case which a court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try and Section provides that Police Officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station may exercise the same powers throughout the local area to which they are appointed as may be exercised by such officer within the limits of his station The word Provincial is undoubtedly used as equivalent to the Presidency of Madras which is one of the Provinces of British India and it is a matter of common knowledge that the department was constituted in pursuance of recommendation of <ORG> which is as follows That there should be constituted in each province <ORG> for the purpose of collecting and distributing information regarding organized crime and to assist in the investigation of crimes when they are of such a special character as to render their assistance necessary I think his evidence and the No Judicial dated nd July which has been put in defining the relations between the Officers of <ORG> and the ordinary Police Officers of <ORG> and the ordinary police officers in the various districts of Presidency was evidence sufficient to support the finding though not perhaps so full as if this objection had been taken when the statements were tendered in evidence and had not been reserved for the argument after the evidence for both sides had been closed In the result I hold there is no ground for interference under this head These three sections Sections and of the Indian Evidence Act and Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which were designed to guard against improper practices on the part of the police in obtaining statements from witnesses and confessions from the accused first made their appearance together as Sections now and of the Criminal Procedure Code of and Sections and of that Code have since been transferred without material alterations to the Indian Evidence Act where they appear as Sections and and as observed by Lord <NAME> in Mayor of Portsmouth <NAME> A at where a single section of an Act is introduced into another Act it must be read in the sense which it bore in the original Act from which it is taken and consequently it is perfectly legitimate to refer to all the rest of that Act in order to ascertain what the section meant though those other sections are not incorporated in the new Act This it seems to me is the proper method to apply even where as here the sections have been introduced into a measure of codification and I am unable to attach much force to arguments depending on the position of Sections and in the Indian Evidence Act As to whether the previous statements of the approvers to the police were inadmissible under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure as previous statements of witnesses to the police the Code of Section now Section provided for the oral examination of witnesses by the police and permitted these statements to be taken down in writing provided that any statement so reduced into writing shall not be signed by the person making it nor shall it be treated as part of the record or used as evidence Such statements were no doubt usually taken down in writing and there does not appear to have been any attempt made to give oral evidence of them to corroborate the witnesses under the Code of or which in this respect were not materially different No statement other than a dying declaration made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this chapter shall if reduced to writing be signed by the person making it or shall be used as evidence against the accused This was dealt with by a new proviso entitling the accused to require the court to refer to such previous statements and if the court thinks it expedient in the interests of justice to direct copies to be given to the accused The present section runs thus No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under the Chapter XIV shall if taken down in writing be signed by the person making it nor shall such writing be used as evidence On this point am of opinion that there was no error in law Going back now to the fourth point whether the statements are inadmissible not under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure as previous statements of witnesses to the police but as confessions made to the police under Section of the Indian Evidence Act which provides that no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of an offence the question is does the section mean that no confession to a police officer by an accused person is to be used against him or that it is not to be used against others either The next Section relating to confessions made by accused persons in the custody of the police unless in the immediate presence of a Magistrate renders them inadmissible as against such persons The two learned Judges forming the majority see no reason why any difference should be made between the two sections and read Section as also relating to confessions made by a person accused of an offence to the police and as rendering such confessions inadmissible only as against them <NAME> on the other hand thinks that confessions made to the police may have been considered to require more stringent provisions than confessions made by accused persons when in police custody to others Section now Section of the Indian Evidence Act then provides that no confession or admission of guilt made to a police officer shall be used as evidence against such person accused of any offence and Section that no confession or admission of guilt made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate shall be used as evidence against such person As I have already said confession in these sections appears to mean confession by an accused person to the police in the course of an investigation under the chapter and as before the passing of Section of the Indian Evidence Act of confessions of accused persons could not be used against co accused such confessions could only be evidence against the accused persons making them or to corroborate their evidence when they turned approvers by treating their confessions as previous statements made by the witnesses under Section of Act II of since reproduced as Section of the Indian Evidence Act Now it may be said on the one hand that as by Section of the Criminal Procedure Code of immediately preceding the legislature had made an exception in the general law regarding the use of previous statements as corroboration restricting the use in evidence of such previous statements if made to the police whether they amounted to confessions or not and practically excluding them it is not likely that they intended in Section to introduce a further exception as to the use of previous statements which amount to confessions that as observed by <NAME> <NAME> if any such fresh provision had been intended it would have extended to exculpatory statements by accused persons as well as to confessions and to confessions made by accused persons whilst in police custody under Section now Section of the Indian Evidence Act as well as to confessions to the police themselves coming within Section now Section of the Indian Evidence Act It may be said further that the language of Section no confession or admission of guilt made to a police officer shall be used as evidence against a person accused of any offence is susceptible of the meaning that no confession made by such a person to the police should be used against him and that in this respect the scope of the two Sections and is the same although in the latter the draftsman dealing with more complicated provisions has expressed his intention with greater precision On the other hand as against this view there is the fact that the terms of the prohibition in Section of the Code of and now in Section of the Indian Evidence Act are perfectly general and as observed by <NAME> a construction which renders statements which are inadmissible against the persons making them admissible against other persons is not one to be favoured It is also perhaps worthy of note that confession to the police which come under Section were forbidden to be recorded by Section whereas there was no such prohibition as regards confessions made by persons in police custody which come under Section It has been held in a long catena of Indian cases that in reviewing a case under Clause of the Letters Patent it is the duty of the court when it finds there has been a misreception of evidence to apply the provisions of Section of the Indian Evidence Act and not to reverse the conviction if it shall appear to the court that independently of the evidence objected to and admitted there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision the decision here being that of the original tribunal Hitherto this jurisdiction under Clause has only been exercised in jury cases where of course no reasons were given for the verdict and the court of review was perforce bound to go into the evidence itself for the purpose of seeing whether or not the remaining evidence justified the decision of the jury In the present case under Section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act the decision is that of the majority of the <ORG> and the reasons for that decision have been given in a most careful and elaborate judgment Now discarding the previous statements of the two approvers to the Inspector we find that within a few days after these statements the approvers made statements to the same effect before a Magistrate Mr <NAME> as to which no question of inadmissibility arises and the learned Judges have observed that even if the statements to the Inspector are discarded and only these recorded by Mr <NAME> are considered they find it impossible to accept the defence theory that the approver story was concocted or tutored and from a perusal of the Judgment it is perfectly plain that discarding the statements to the Inspector they accepted the evidence of the two approvers as generally truthful and acted upon it as they were entitled to do If then the <ORG> had rejected the statements made to the Inspector and still convicted the accused it would have been impossible for us to say that there was not sufficient evidence to justify their decision and it appears to me to be equally impossible for us to say so when in effect the learned Judges tell us that though considering the evidence admissible they did not consider it necessary to base their decision upon it and were prepared to convict without it To hold so as a matter of law would it seems to me deprive the court of the discretion given by Section of the Indian Evidence Act to raise or not to raise the presumption would in effect substitute the phrase shall presume for may presume in that section I do not dissent from the decisions which have held that ordinarily as a matter of practice a court should not accept the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice as sufficient evidence to support a conviction but it is impossible consistently with the Indian Evidence Act to hold that as a matter of law the presumption must be raised and rebutted by special circumstances or by corroboration I am not sure that the conclusion of <NAME> stated at page of the printed judgments differ materially from those of the other two learned Judges bur if he intended to lay it down as law that a conviction is illegal which is based upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice unless something which amounts in law to a special circumstance be found by the judge or jury then it seems to me he goes beyond the statement of the English law accepted from Taylor on Evidence by the <ORG> in <NAME> for that statement so far as I am at present concerned with it is only to the effect that the respect habitually paid by Juries to the advice of judges has given rise to a settled practice not to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice except in very special circumstances Consequently as I understand it judges are bound by law to advise juries to adhere to this practice but it does not follow that juries are bound as a matter of law to do so It was not denied that such statements cannot having regard to Section of the Indian Evidence Act be excluded if made in the circumstances set forth in the section and inasmuch as the section expressly admits them in order to corroborate the testimony of a witness it necessarily follows that they are legal corroboration of the evidence given at the trial Consequently I must take it I think that the Advocate General suggests for our consideration the view that the phrase corroborated in material particulars in illustration to Section is a technical term connoting a corroboration different from that of Section in fact a corroboration by independent or untainted evidence The evidence I conclude is admissible as corroboration and whether it is sufficient or not to justify the court in believing the evidence given at the trial is a question of the weight to be given to it and not a question of law declined to consider whether the rule should be extended to the case of previous statements made before arrest and that <NAME> at page is prepared to hold that there might possibly be a difference where the previous statement of an accomplice is made at a time when there was no inducement to make a false statement and in circumstances which indicate that it is true But if previous statements made under some circumstances are sufficient corroboration then it seems to me very difficult to lay down as a matter of law the rule suggested by the Advocate General simply because in our opinion such cases are fewer than those in which the previous statements are valueless And there is no need for us to try to do so the discretion given to Judges and juries in weighing evidence is all that is required and no rule is in my opinion wanted except to secure that Judges and Juries dealing with facts shall have fully before them the defects inherent in the evidence of accomplices and the tests which experience has shewn to be the best aids in estimating its real value in the particular case I do not think that our decision upon points and can affect our judgment on the case because it seems to me quite clear from their judgment that the Chief Justice and <NAME> <NAME> were prepared to arrive at the conclusion at which they did arrive whether the evidence of <NAME> proving previous statements of the accomplices <NAME> and <NAME> is admitted or rejected It seems therefore to me really unnecessary to express any opinion upon these three points but I follow my learned colleagues in doing so The existence of the conspiracy alleged by <NAME> was relevant to the issues involved in that investigation and the statement of <NAME> was therefore relevant to that investigation and it makes no difference that the conspiracy alleged by <NAME> has not been shewn at the trial to have been a conspiracy of abettors of the particular murder in question I therefore find nothing in the evidence put before us to require me to hold that the Chief Justice and <NAME> <NAME> were in error on this point The fourth point On this point I am of opinion that there is no error of law in the judgment of the Chief Justice and <NAME> I agree with those learned Judges that there is no difference in the object of Sections and of the Indian Evidence Act that both are aimed at the same mischief and I have not been satisfied that that there is any substantial reason for attributing to the legislature an intention to place a confession made to a police officer on a different footing from one made by a person in the custody of the police Consequently I approach the consideration of this question from the point of view that as Section applies only to the proof of a confession as against its maker so it should be held that Section has a similar scope unless we are bound by its language or for some other reason to give it a wider application Now Sections and of the Indian Evidence Act were imported into the Indian Evidence Act from the Criminal Procedure Code of where they were placed among the provisions dealing with the powers of police officers in making investigations into cases of alleged offences So far as I know there was at that time that it is in no provision in the law of evidence as administered in India corresponding to Section of the Indian Evidence Act of and so there is no apparent reason why it should suggest itself to the framers of the code that it was necessary to provide for the case of the use of a confession as against any person other than the person who made it By Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure of a police officer is prohibited from making a record of a confession except for his own information when the confession is made by a person accused of any offence that is to say as I understand it a person against whom mere is a case which is being investigated under Section vide Section Section forbids the use of any confession made to a police officer as evidence against a person accused of any offence that is to say or so it seems to me the same person whose confession the police officer is forbidden to record except for his own information The case having been investigated the person accused of any offence is put on his trial the confessions made by him to the police officer or while in custody of the police officer are not to be used as evidence against him That it seems to me is the natural meaning of these provisions and the only meaning appropriate to them having regard to their position in the Code of Criminal Procedure In short they have nothing to do with the statements of witnesses I think then there can be very little doubt that in the Code of both these sections were intended to prevent the use as evidence against the maker of confessions made actually or in effect to police officers And I am unable to see that it is more dangerous to allow a witness to be corroborated by a self incriminating statement made to a police officer than by a self exculpatory statement to the same officer I may add that I do not think the cases dealing with the Section have any great bearing on the question which I am discussing On this point I desire only to say that the language of the section and the history of the various amendments made from time to time constrain us to accept the law as laid down by the learned Judges of <ORG> There is no ground on which we can interfere with the decision of <ORG> and the petitions of the accused must be dismissed and as I have said the same result is arrived at if I am wrong and if the evidence of <NAME> is excluded so far as it relates to the previous statements made by <NAME> and <NAME> Fourteen persons were tried on charges under Section A Indian Penal Code and Section Indian Penal Code read with Sections and by a Special Bench of three learned Judges the Chief Justice <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> Under Section of the Act referred to judgment was pronounced in accordance with the opinion of the majority and sentences were passed accordingly The present Advocate General who appeared for the <ORG> has taken the preliminary objection that Article of the Letters Patent has no application to a case tried in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act and we have therefore no jurisdiction to review the case Article defines the local limits of the ordinary original criminal jurisdiction which mainly coincides with the local limits of its ordinary civil jurisdiction and Article empowers <ORG> in the exercise of such jurisdiction to try all persons brought before it in due course of law Article next lays down that the accused has no right of appeal to <ORG> from any sentence or order passed in any criminal trial before the courts of original criminal jurisdiction which may be constituted by one or more judges of <ORG> but that it shall be at the discretion of any such court to reserve any point or points of law for the opinion of <ORG> Article provides that on such a point or points being so reserved or on its being certified by the Advocate General that in his opinion there is an error in the decision of a point of law decided by the court of original criminal jurisdiction or that a point of law which has been decided by the said court shall be further considered the said court shall have full power and authority to review the case or such part of it as may be necessary and finally determine such point of law and thereupon to alter the sentence passed by the court of original jurisdiction and pass such judgment and sentence as to <ORG> shall seem right It is argued on behalf of the <ORG> that the court of original criminal jurisdiction referred to in Articles and refer to the court exercising the ordinary and extraordinary original criminal jurisdiction mentioned in Articles and and that the trial in this case was not held in the exercise of either description of jurisdiction I think there is force in the first part of this argument as both Articles and speak of the court of original criminal jurisdiction apparently meaning the court exercising the ordinary or extraordinary criminal jurisdiction of <ORG> mentioned in Articles and To these cases Article would not perhaps be applicable but I have no hesitation in holding that the contention of the Advocate General that the present is such a case is clearly untenable The prisoners are all residents of the Madras Presidency and over them the <ORG> undoubtedly have jurisdiction under the first part of Article It is therefore apparently not a case in which <ORG> has no jurisdiction under the Letters Patent but derives its jurisdiction from a special statute The Act proceeds on the assumption that the Magistrate who held the enquiry should commit the persons charged to <ORG> to whose superintendence the Magistrate is subject see Sections and It no doubt makes a radical change in the procedure to be pursued in the trial at <ORG> by enacting that the trial shall not be by a jury and to this extent the change is no doubt one affecting the forum of trial But it does not purport to affect the jurisdiction of <ORG> as conferred upon it by the Letters Patent it only regulates the manner of the exercise of its jurisdiction That the question whether a trial should be held by a judge and a jury or otherwise is not to be treated as one relating to jurisdiction is also amply indicated by the fact that it is not Articles and of the Letters Patent by which jurisdiction is given to this <ORG> in criminal cases that require that trials should be held by a judge and a jury that matter is dealt with by Article which regulates the procedure in trials The argument on which the Advocate General lays the most emphasis is that <ORG> in its extraordinary jurisdiction can only try such persons as are brought before it on charges preferred by the Advocate General which is not the case here or by any Magistrate or other officer expressly empowered by the Government in that behalf and that in this case the Magistrate who committed the accused for trial to <ORG> could not be taken to have preferred the charges within the meaning of Article as he did not derive his authority to do so from the Government but from the legislature It does not seem to me that there is any force in this contention The Sub Divisional Magistrate of Tinnevelly who committed this case was undoubtedly appointed to his office by the Government and it was by virtue of that office that he took cognizance of the offence and preferred charges against the accused in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Then <ORG> under Section of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act directed that the provisions of that Act should apply to those proceedings that is among other matters the Magistrate who had taken cognizance of the offence should send the accused to <ORG> for trial upon charges to be framed by him This is therefore clearly a case in which the Magistrate was expressly empowered by the Government to prefer the charges on which the accused were tried by <ORG> even giving a narrow and literal meaning to these words I do not think there is any force again in this argument I purpose to consider the questions raised by the first two paragraphs of the certificate together I may observe that these two grounds of the certificate are couched in absolutely general terms but it is clear that the intention of the Advocate General was not to raise mere abstract questions of law without reference to the circumstances of the case in which the view of law of the majority of <ORG> which we are asked to reconsider was expressed and applied I shall therefore briefly state the circumstances in which the various questions of law have arisen So far as some of the prisoners are concerned namely those whom <NAME> alone has acquitted the evidence of the <ORG> apart from evidence relating to the general circumstances of the case consisted principally of the testimony of three approvers <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and the statements which are said to have been wrongly admitted or used as corroborative evidence are statements made by these men on several occasions before trial In dealing with the question whether the way in which the learned Chief Justice and <NAME> <NAME> approached the consideration of the evidence of these approvers involves an error in law one has to bear in mind the nature of the crime to which the approvers speak the part which they themselves played in it and the circumstances in which they have come forward to give evidence for the <ORG> As unanimously found by <ORG> <NAME> st accused who had been engaged for some time in journalistic work of a more or less seditious character set on foot early in April the conspiracy the subject of the first count for the purpose of overthrowing the British rule by means of a simultaneous massacre of all Europeans on a day to be subsequently fixed This plan which was as original as it is startling in conception was thought of because all other methods which had been tried before by those who have been engaged in the criminal conspiracies against the Government which have come to light in recent years in some parts of India such as preaching writing in newspapers and isolated assassinations had failed In all probability the idea would have died a natural death and would not even have been heard of except for an event which in the language of the judgment of the majority of the <ORG> has little or no bearing on the charge of conspiracy The approvers in this case are therefore men who were giving their evidence with halters round their necks to use an expressive phrase which I believe occurs in one of the numerous cases cited at the bar on the subject of accomplice evidence I would not for my part hesitate in saying that a conviction founded on evidence of this character must be wrong as being based on absolutely unsafe materials unless there are to be found in the case the amplest guarantees of its truth derived from circumstances and evidence altogether independent of these witnesses statements As I read their judgment they are of opinion that this evidence from its very nature must be received with caution and care and that though it was correct to say as contended for on behalf of the defence that it was not open to them in law to act upon it yet they would not feel themselves safe in accepting such evidence in so far as it affected the prisoners without corroboration There are passages in the judgment of the majority of the Bench which go to show that they were prepared to believe the general truth of the approvers story apart from any corroborative evidence but none from which it can be reasonably inferred that they would have accepted that evidence alone as sufficient to prove the complicity of the prisoners On the other hand they attach the utmost importance to certain previous statements of the approvers as corroborative of their evidence in court and when they came to consider the case of the <ORG> against the accused persons individually they take care to state whether the corroborative evidence such as it is implicates or does not implicate particular prisoners We have to direct ourselves Then if you believe it act on it even if there is no corroboration in the strict sense of the word But they do so apparently to meet the extreme arguments of the pleaders on behalf of the accused to the contrary and not because they were prepared in the case before them to act upon such evidence Both parts of the first paragraph of the certificate must be read together and so read what the certificate really means is that the Judges statement that the law permitted of a conviction being based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is inaccurate inasmuch as it does not add the necessary qualification that apart from any special circumstances the <ORG> ought to raise the presumption spoken of in Section illustration that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars and therefore in ordinary cases the conviction would be illegal if based on such evidence In this view of the matter it would have been unnecessary to go further into the first question but for the fact that in my opinion certain statements which were relied upon by the learned Judges as corroborative evidence justifying them in acting upon the evidence of the approvers as against the accused persons have been wrongly so used and it will thus be necessary to see whether we can hold that apart from any corroboration this is a case in which there are circumstances which might make the general rule relating to the untrustworthiness of an accomplices evidence inapplicable Besides the whole question as to the proper scope of the law regarding the subject having been raised the first ground of the certificate and elaborately discussed at the bar it is right that one should state one opinion in the matter The only point that has any novelty in this case is whether this <ORG> can interfere as a matter of law with a conviction founded upon the evidence of an accomplice in a trial held by a judge without a jury where there is no corroboration of such evidence or if the evidence which the <ORG> has relied on as corroborative is not such as to meet the requirements of the rule and if so in what circumstances When there has been an appeal to <ORG> from a conviction of a magistrate and it has confirmed the conviction and in certain cases of summary trial by a Magistrate in which the legislature allows no appeal the <ORG> has the power of revising the case see Sections and Criminal Procedure Code In other cases the question whether a conviction based on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices can be regarded as erroneous in law may be of some practical importance though the fact that the <ORG> in any particular case did interfere in revision to set aside the conviction would not necessarily mean that it treated the question as one of law When a case is tried by a Sessions Judge with the aid of jury the prisoner can appeal to the <ORG> against the verdict only on a matter of law see Section Criminal Procedure Code if the trial was held by a Judge of the <ORG> in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction then as we have seen the prisoner has no right of appeal but if the trying Judge has reserved any point of law for the decision of the <ORG> or the Advocate General has certified to an error in a decision of law <ORG> is entitled to decide that point of law and pass such judgment as the case may require Now whether <ORG> exercises its powers as <ORG> under Section Criminal Procedure Code in cases tried by a jury or as a court of error under Article of the Letters Patent in either case it can interfere only when the trial is vitiated by an error in law and there is no substantial difference in the conditions of interference in the two cases On the other hand it is equally clear that the law makes special provisions as regards the treatment of an accomplice evidence the reception of that evidence stands on a different footing from the evidence of other witnesses On the other hand the rule of law that the guilt of an accused person must be established beyond all reasonable doubt applies with equal force in all cases and the more serious the nature of the crime with which a person is charged the more circumspect the court must be as to the evidence it acts upon In one part of the arguments of the learned Advocate General on behalf of the <ORG> he seemed to contend if I followed him aright that inasmuch as the legislature by Section of the Indian Evidence Act declares that a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice it must necessarily follow that in no case where a conviction is based on such testimony by a tribunal of facts is such conviction liable to review by a superior authority whose powers of interference are limited to matters of law There is an apparent fallacy in this argument which treats the declaration that a conviction is not illegal merely because it is based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice as equivalent to a declaration that a conviction based on such testimony must necessarily be regarded as legal Then the legislature goes on to state But the court shall have regard to such facts as the following in considering whether such maxims do or do not apply and cites two cases in explanation of illustration suggesting without expressly saying so that the maxim as to an accomplice being unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars might not apply to those cases Whenever therefore the presumption is not raised or acted upon it must appear that special circumstances existed in the case which either negatived the presumption or rebutted it No doubt there are cases and cases and while in doubtful cases the position contended for on behalf of the <ORG> may well be sound there is nothing at least in the Indian Evidence Act or in reason that in other cases in which there could be no two opinions that the presumption that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless corroborated applies in full force not being either negatived or rebutted an omission to raise the obvious presumption should not be treated as an error in law Now if the view which I have above indicated of the effect of the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act be correct there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion that these provisions are in any respect different from what is laid down in the rulings of <ORG> on the subject either since the passing of the Indian Evidence Act or before it or of <ORG> In that case <NAME> case Criminal Rulings page Sir <NAME> in his well known judgment fully investigated the whole question relating to an accomplice evidence after an elaborate survey of the English and Indian authorities and what he then laid down has not only been since followed as the law by all the courts without question but the Indian legislature when it came to pass the Indian Evidence Act has embodied the important principles enunciated in that judgment in Section and the illustrations to Section above referred to But as a general rule there is danger in acting upon the evidence of an accomplice who is admitted to give evidence for the Crown for reasons already indicated and that this danger is at least as great here as in England The danger however disappears if the grounds which give rise to the apprehension are found to be absent in any particular case and he cites a hypothetical case which is embodied as sub illustration to illustration to Section As regards the duty of the judge in dealing with such evidence he lays down with reference to the provisions of the then Criminal Procedure Code which in this respect are the same as Section of the present Code imposing upon the judge the duty of summing up the evidence and also upon general principles relating to trials by jury as are to be gathered from the decisions and practice of English judges that it is quite as necessary here as in England if not more so that the evidence of accomplices should not be left to a jury without such directions and observations from the judge as the circumstances of the case may require that the giving of improper advice by the judge or omission by him to give that advice which the Judge in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion ought to give upon questions of fact or as to the degree of credit to be given to particular witnesses is an error in law in the summing up He also holds that it would be an error in the summing up to tell the jury that the evidence of the accomplices was corroborated by evidence of a fact which did not amount to any corroboration at all He finally lays down that where there is an error in the summing up of the evidence that would warrant the court in setting aside the verdict of guilty if the court is satisfied that the prisoner was prejudiced by the error and that there has been a failure of justice But the verdict and conviction ought not to be set aside if the court be of opinion that it was warranted by the evidence and upon the evidence they would have upheld the conviction on appeal if the trial had been by the judge with the aid of assessors instead of by a jury <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> on the other hand upheld a verdict of a jury since the judge had properly cautioned them on the point and as the jury still found a verdict of guilty there was no error in law The learned judges considered the effect of the enactment and their conclusion was that Section illustration contained a legislative declaration that regard being had to the common course of natural events and human conduct an accomplice is unworthy of credit so far as his testimony implicating another person is concerned unless he is corroborated in material particulars in respect of the prisoner but that in exceptional cases such as those mentioned in the sub illustrations the <ORG> might give credit to the accomplices testimony against the accused if it sees good reasons for doing so upon grounds other than the personal corroboration The earliest decision of this <ORG> under the Indian Evidence Act brought to our notice is in <NAME> <NAME> I I where <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> laid down that it was not the law that the evidence of an accomplice was irreceivable in evidence without corroboration and that Sections and illustration coincide with the rule in England Some reliance was placed on this ruling on behalf of the <ORG> as if it laid down the law differently from the other decisions but I find nothing to support the suggestion in considering the question whether certain evidence can be considered corroborative evidence in the sense in which judges require corroboration of an accomplice statement within the meaning of Section illustration they take it for granted that the rule is to require such corroboration The Judge ought also to add he says that a conviction upon such testimony is perfectly legal and if a jury bearing in mind the caution still believed the evidence it would be their duty to convict while admitting the existence of the general rule point out that all persons coming within the category of accomplices cannot be treated as on precisely the same footing Jenkins <NAME> and <NAME> point out that the absolute rule of law on the subject of accomplices testimony is contained in Section of the Indian Evidence Act there is further a rule of guidance which is embodied in Section illustration and that it would be an error of law to disregard the presumption indicated in the latter rule recognise the rule of practice which lays down that it is generally wrong to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but they agree with the proposition stated in King Emperor <NAME> I that the rule does not apply in equal force to all persons coming technically within the category I wish to allude very briefly to the rulings in some English cases decided after the date of the judgment of Sir <NAME> in <NAME> case as the English decisions prior to that judgment are exhaustively dealt with there <NAME> observes that there is no doubt that the evidence of an accomplice requires corroboration the Lord Chief justice <NAME> in his direction to the jury observed if the jury upon the evidence of the approver himself was perfectly satisfied that he was speaking the truth there was no reason in point of law why on his evidence they should not act and find the accused guilty but the danger of acting upon the uncorroborated statement of an approver was obvious and the wisdom of requiring that some corroborative evidence should be given before such statements are acted upon was perfectly apparent to any intelligent mind In In re <NAME> where the question was whether the evidence of an accomplice if uncorroborated was sufficient to justify a committal for surrender to France <NAME> held that it was not the law that a prisoner must be acquitted in the absence of corroborative evidence and there was no power in the court to withdraw a case from the jury on that ground In <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> while pointing out that there was no definite rule of law that a person cannot be convicted upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice as stated by <NAME> in In re <NAME> observed that he ought to have added assuming that the jury was cautioned in accordance with the ordinary practice and then cites the following passage from Taylor on Evidence Edition page as containing a correct exposition of the law In <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> quashed a conviction on the ground that there was very little if any evidence of corroboration proper to go to the jury and that the judge did not adequately direct the jury that they should acquit the appellant if the accomplice story was not corroborated in some material particular that is in some particular that involved the guilt of the accused It seems to me that in the last two cases the words directing the jury to acquit should perhaps be understood in the sense of advising the jury to that effect and not in the sense of withdrawing the case from the jury It should be pointed out with reference to the judgments of <ORG> in England that though under Edw Section the prisoner is given an appeal as of right only on a question of law the appellate court has the power in certain circumstances to review the verdict and conviction on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact But they seem to lay down generally that it is the duty of the judge to advise the jury not to convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and a failure to discharge that duty would ipso facto make the conviction liable to be set aside It will none the less in my opinion be an error in law if the trial was held without a jury and the Judge or the Magistrate misdirected himself on this point and treated an accomplice evidence like that of any other witness If there are any especial circumstances which would justify a disregard of this rule those circumstances in a trial by a jury must be clearly set out in the directions of the judge and the appellate court is entitled to consider as a matter of law whether those circumstances are such as to justify the exceptional treatment The question whether it can be said as a matter of law that the view of the trying judge as to whether certain evidence does or does not amount to corroboration within the meaning of the rule is also governed by the same principle as I have just indicated This brings me to the second question propounded in the certificate where the rule is stated in unqualified terms and in Vyasa Rao Emperor Vol it seems to me on further consideration that to be quite accurate the rule must be stated subject to the qualification which I have suggested and I may point out that neither the learned Judges of <ORG> nor I were called upon in the cases mentioned above to consider whether the rule was subject to any qualification As regards the statements made to Mr <NAME> no objection can be taken to their admissibility but so far as at present advised I fail to see how it can be held to afford corroborative evidence within the meaning of the rule The learned judges who formed the majority of <ORG> do not find that these approvers did not make the statements to Mr <NAME> in the hope of being pardoned nor do they say that the circumstances in which the statements were made precluded the possibility of their acting in concert That allegation has been found by the learned Judges to be untrue but they do not find that in fact these accused came to be known to the approvers only by reason of their being members of the criminal conspiracy on the other hand it is found in their judgment that there was an association palled <ORG> which according to them though of a seditious tendency was not actually a criminal association and some of the accused at least were members of that association The objection taken in the third ground to the admissibility of the statements made by two of the approvers to the Inspector of <ORG> is in my opinion well founded Those statements are admitted under Section of the Indian Evidence Act not on the ground that they were made at the time when the fact of seditious conspiracy to which they relate took place for the last act in connection with the seditious conspiracy spoken to by the approvers had taken place months before the making of the statements but on the ground that they were made to an authority competent to investigate the fact The statements were made in the course of an investigation in the case of the murder of Mr <NAME> had authority to inquire into the murder of Mr <NAME> he would have no authority to investigate the fact of a conspiracy dealt with under Section A of the Indian Penal Code which is a non cognizable offence without a Magistrate warrant see Section Criminal Procedure Code Here the fact is the conspiracy and this fact the officers concerned in the case had no authority to investigate at the time the statements were made But it is said that the statements were made in the course of an investigation of an offence which was within the competency of the Police Officers One would not in my opinion be justified in construing Section in a loose general sense having regard to the fact that it permits a statement made in the absence of a party to a proceeding which he had no means of testing to be used in evidence against him I may mention that it was argued by the pleaders for the accused that the word investigate in Section in the Indian Evidence Act is used in the technical sense of the Criminal Procedure Code There is nothing indeed that I can usefully add to his arguments based on the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code on which the decision of the question depends I may observe that Section of the Police Act XXIV of throws no light inasmuch as the Sections of that Act which defined the power of a police officer have been replaced by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code That section runs thus No confession made to a Police Officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence I agree with the contention of Mr <NAME> that the words a person there mean any person but the real point in connection with the applicability of the Section to the statements of the approvers is what is the meaning in which the word confession is used in that Section It could not have been used in the wide and popular sense in which it is used in every day conversation as meaning an acknowledgment of some fault for that would make the section ridiculous and there can be little doubt that it is to be understood in the technical sense of the criminal law What then is that meaning It is suggested that confession in criminal law means an admission of certain facts which constitute an offence or lead to an inference of guilt Yes but admission by whom When the word is used in the technical sense of the criminal law does it not always mean such an admission as above referred to when made by a person who is charged with the offence which is the subject matter of the statement That is at least how I have always understood the word If the word as used in Section be understood without reference to the question whether the parson making it was ever tried or not for the offence to which he confesses then it would follow that any statement by a witness to police officer which leads to an inference of guilt under the general provisions of any Act however unconnected with the offence under inquiry would be inadmissible by reason of this section Suppose A who does not possess the necessary license sent his servant with a quantity of opium for sale and the servant returning after having sold the opium is robbed of the money could it be said that in a trial of persons charged with the robbery the statement of the master made to a police officer immediately after the occurrence that he had sent the servant to sell opium could not be received in evidence under Section of the Indian Evidence Act because the witness statement would amount to a confession of an offence under the Excise Act I think not Whenever the evidentiary value of a statement as against the person making it is in question it is then that it would be properly called an admission or confession according as the proceeding in which the question arises is of a civil or criminal nature but not when it is intended to be used as evidence against a third person For it cannot be disputed that an admission or confession means a statement amounting to an acknowledgment of certain legal liability or of facts which give raise to such liability against the person making the acknowledgment then how can such statement be called either admission or confession in a case where the only question for consideration is how far the liability of a third person and not of the person making the statement is established thereby Much stress is laid on the fact that in Section confession is not expressly mentioned as of an accused person while it is so used in Section but if the word has a well known meaning in the criminal law as I think it has then his argument has no force The last ground of the certificate is that Section of the Criminal Procedure Code which lays down No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this chapter shall if taken down in writing be signed by the person making it nor shall such writing be used as evidence forbids not only the use of the writing as evidence of the statement but of the statement itself even if it is sought to be proved without the writing I therefore agree with the view of the Special Bench on this point which is also the view taken by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> in <NAME> Emperor I <NAME> in <NAME> King Emperor A The result of what I have said is that those prisoners in my opinion must be acquitted and discharged whose convictions rest on the testimony of the approvers without any corroboration independently of the previous statements of these witnesses made to the police officer <NAME> or to Mr <NAME> unless the learned Counsel for the <ORG> wishes to argue that there are facts and circumstances not mentioned in the judgment of the majority of <ORG> which by themselves or if considered along those noticed in the judgment of the Bench take the case out of the general rule that an accomplice must be deemed unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars or that there is evidence apart from that relied on by the majority of <ORG> which furnishes the necessary corroboration within the meaning of the rule as I have stated it In that event the case must be argued further for under Section of the Letters Patent as I read it a sentence is not to be set aside simply because there is an error of law involved in the direction of the judge to the jury or in the judgment of a judge sitting without a jury if such error has not occasioned a miscarriage of justice That statute entitles the Governor General in <ORG> or <ORG> to direct the at the special procedure prescribed therein should apply to the proceedings in respect of any offence of which a Magistrate has taken cognizance Section lays down that The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall not apply to proceedings taken under this part in so far as they are inconsistent with the special procedure prescribed in this part Mr <NAME> contends that cases under the Act must be governed only by the special procedure laid down therein and that there is no provision in it for any review by this court either upon any reservation of a point or points of law by the Bench trying the case or on a certificate by the Advocate General that in his judgment there is an error in the decision of a point or points of law decided by the Special Bench or that the point or points of law which has or have been decided by it should be further considered This clause gives power to <ORG> to review on the Advocate General certificate in every case mentioned in Clause There is no reference in the clause to Clauses and and there is nothing in the words limiting its operation to the cases comprised in Clauses and Clause ordains that <ORG> shall have extraordinary original criminal jurisdiction over all persons residing in places within the jurisdiction of any court now subject to the superintendence of the said <ORG> and shall have authority to try at its discretion any such persons brought before it on charges preferred by the Advocate General or by any Magistrate or other officer specially empowered by the <ORG> in that behalf There is no reason for not placing a similar construction on Clauses and Clause as already mentioned gives power to <ORG> to try any person brought before it on charges preferred by any Magistrate or other special officer empowered by the <ORG> in that behalf For the decision of this case there are two points for consideration as to the meaning of this sentence There is no doubt force in this argument but it seems to me to be doubtful whether it is sound in this case It does not appear that there was any provision of law at the time of the Letters Patent empowering the <ORG> to give special authority to particular Magistrates to prefer a criminal charge There is no apparent reason for giving it a different meaning in applying it to a Magistrate There is nothing in the clause to show that the charge must be preferred directly to <ORG> Magistrates and other officers generally have no power to do so though the Advocate General has and always had It is not shown that any Magistrates or other officers besides the Advocate General had at the date of the Letters Patent the power in any case to prefer a charge directly to <ORG> The accused were admittedly brought before this Court in a lawful manner This would seem prima facie to be opposed to the very words of Section of the Indian Evidence Act which lays down in positive terms that a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice For that would be directly contrary to the definition of may presume in Section of the Act according to which whenever it is provided by this Act that the court may presume a fact it may either regard such fact as proved unless and until it is disproved or may call for proof of it The argument for the accused at the hearing was and I take it the view suggested by the Advocate General also was that notwithstanding the liberty given to the court not to regard a fact referred to in Section as not proved and to call for proof of it the meaning and intention of the section must be taken to be that ordinarily the presumption referred to in illustration to Section must be made and that special circumstances must be found by the court whenever it does not do so After laying down the proposition of the law above mentioned the learned Judges proceed to consider the nature of the corroborative evidence that is required in the case of accomplice testimony They then proceed to deal with all the evidence on record against each of the accused persons including both the testimony of the approvers and the corroborative evidence adduced by the prosecution and with the evidence let in by each of the accused on his behalf and come to a conclusion with respect to the guilt or innocence of each of the accused on the whole of the evidence let in both for the prosecution and for the defence Even if we should now come to the conclusion that the general proposition enunciated by the majority of <ORG> that it was open to them to convict the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of the approvers is not sound this conclusion would not affect their judgment which is not based on such uncorroborated accomplice testimony alone It was urged on behalf of the accused that the majority of <ORG> take the law in this country to be in accordance with the English law on the subject and the opinions of judges in other cases to the same effect are also cited to induce us to hold that the question should be decided in accordance with the English law It is not possible to countenance the view that the court is absolutely bound to regard a fact as proved which according to the positive language of Section it may either regard as proved or may call proof of The terms of the Section are such as to reduce to their proper position of mere maxims which are to be applied to facts by the courts in their discretion a large number of presumptions to which the English law gives to a greater or less extent an artificial value But although the question of the admissibility of the evidence of an accomplice had been long settled and the legality of a conviction based on the sole testimony of an accomplice was established in <NAME> <NAME> the sentiment against placing reliance on such evidence could not die out The legislature itself found it necessary to enact that the evidence of highly interested witnesses should be materially corroborated by independent evidence in particular classes of cases The result is that we find much variety and uncertainty in the manner in which accomplice evidence was treated in decided cases while at the same time the principle is reiterated from time to time that there is no rule of law restraining the action of the judges and juries in dealing with such evidence and judges ostensibly refrained from any attempt to set up any presumption of law against its trustworthiness <NAME> <NAME> observed as follows The truth of the matter is there is no rule of law at all that an accomplice cannot be believed unless he is confirmed It is an observation addressed not to the court to exclude the evidence but addressed to the jury who have to weigh the evidence and it is for them to say whether the confirmation will satisfy them or whether they will be satisfied without any If they are satisfied without any confirmation they may be and their verdict may be an honest and just and true one The directions of judges given to juries in that respect are not directions in point of law which juries are bound to adopt but observations respecting facts which judges are very properly in the habit of giving because with respect to matters of fact the judge as well as the counsel upon both sides endeavour to assist the jury The principle laid down in the above case was not always observed Permission to examine an accomplice as a witness was sometimes refused on the ground that no corroborative evidence was forthcoming These cases proceeded certainly on the footing that the accused should not be convicted on the evidence of an accomplice alone and that there was a legal presumption against its trustworthiness Further the rule regarding the necessity for corroboration was often relaxed in the case of misdemeanours See Archbold Criminal Pleading XXIII Edition page In <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> <NAME> while agreeing that there is no definite rule of law that a prisoner cannot be convicted on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice said that in his opinion it was of the highest importance that the jury should be cautioned against accepting the evidence of an accomplice without corroboration In that case where the question was whether a Magistrate was right in passing an order for the surrender of the accused to the French Government under the Extradition Act on the ground that there was no proper corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice <NAME> and <NAME> J<NAME> held that the absence of corroboration was no ground for holding that the case was not to belaid before the jury <NAME> <NAME> in withdrew from the jury one of the counts in an indictment upon which there was very clear and unshaken evidence by the accomplice but nothing else It seems to me that having regard to the condition of the case law in England it would be safe to proceed to determine the law in this country by a consideration mainly if not solely of the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act It is impossible to hold that the court is in all cases bound to make the presumption without regard to the particular facts and circumstances of each case for in that case the legislature would have said that the court shall presume the un trustworthiness of an accomplice If the question be whether there is any error of law in his judgment the court is entitled to consider whether the rule embodied in Section was present to his mind and whether he exercised his discretion after considering the materials On record His judgment will be examined for the purpose of enabling the court of law to decide whether the discretion was exercised in a legal manner The decision of the question would depend on the consideration of his judgment as a whole Up to this point I think there is not much room for doubt But can it further be laid down that it is the duty of a judge deciding the facts to make the presumption that an uncorroborated accomplice is unworthy of credit unless there be special reasons which would justify the refusal to make it On this point I am of opinion that there is room for the growth of judiciary law With regard to illustration where the accomplice has not already been convicted of the offence in which he took part and has given evidence in the hope of a pardon his evidence is of a particularly unworthy character <NAME> I <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that the court or jury is required by Section to take into consideration certain facts with the view to ascertain the probability of the story told And the rule in this Section is thus brought to coincide with the rule observed in England that though the tainted testimony of an accomplice should be carefully scanned and received with caution and may be treated as unworthy of credit yet if the jury in the one case or the court in the other credits the evidence a conviction proceeding upon it is not illegal This observation in ray opinion went too far unless it was based on the facts of the particular case <NAME> said I am however unable to agree with <NAME> that if the first witness was only an accomplice it would be the duty of the judge to direct the jury that there was not sufficient evidence before them upon which they would be justified in finding the accused guilty and with all respect I should say that this would be misdirection It may be that except under very special circumstances the settled course of practice is not to convict a prisoner upon the sole and uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and if in the opinion of the judge there are no special circumstances which would induce him to give credit to the evidence of the accomplice and convict the prisoner on his sole uncorroborated testimony he may no doubt under Sub section of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure express such opinion to the jury and in that sense advise them to acquit the prisoner Phear <NAME> held that the omission to give the usual caution to the jury was a misdirection and that he was wrong in the particular case in saying to the jury that it was not proper or necessary for him to tell them that the evidence of the accomplice was to be received with caution <NAME> <NAME> says that admittedly the testimony of accomplices required to be corroborated in material particulars and no question arose as to whether the court was bound to make the presumption mentioned in Section illustration In Queen Empress <NAME> and <NAME> I Scott <NAME> observes with respect to cases tried by a judge himself But it much clearly appear to the court sitting in revision that the character of the witness was persent in his mind when the judge or magistrate came to such a conclusion that is that the evidence of the accomplice was trustworthy But if that is so there is no ground for interference of a revisional character He said He had nothing before him but the corrupt evidence of confessed accomplice In Queen Empress <NAME> I Birdwood <NAME> was of opinion that <ORG> could in revision consider whether there were good grounds to warrant the lower court in not making the presumption that an accomplice witness was untrustworthy The illustration is however the rule and when it is departed from I think the court should show or that it should appear that the circumstances justify the exceptional treatment of the case No other case of importance has been brought to our notice at the arguments I do not think that there is really anything in the judgment of the majority of <ORG> to show that the learned <NAME>udges really took a different view though they do not consider the question whether special reasons should be exhibited for not requiring corroboration Their Lordships say that it should be borne in mind that the evidence of the approvers is tainted evidence This <ORG> dealing as a court of review with the question whether there is any error of law in the view taken by the majority is not concerned to consider whether those reasons were as a matter of fact sufficient to justify the acceptance of the approvers evidence as generally true Mr <NAME> raised a further contention on the first point in the Advocate General certificate that the majority of <ORG> were wrong in their view as to what constitutes material particulars in respect of which corroboration of an accomplice testimony is required Clause of the Letters Patent provides that on its being certified by the said Advocate General that in his judgment there is an error in the decision of a point or points of law decided by the court of original criminal jurisdiction or that a point or points of law which has or have been decided by the said court should be further considered the said <ORG> shall have full power and authority to review the case or such part of it as may be necessary and finally determine such point or points of law and thereupon to alter the sentence passed by the court of original jurisdiction and to pass such judgment and sentence as to the said <ORG> shall seem right It is contended that the clause gives power to the <ORG> whenever a certificate has been granted by the Advocate General to review the case or any part of it that the court may seem fit to review and that practically the whole case becomes open when a certificate is granted The statement in it is that the court shall have power and authority to review the case or such part of it as may be necessary not as the court may think fit Obviously I think for deciding the point or points of law reserved or certified as requiring consideration It has then power to alter the sentence passed by the court of original jurisdiction and to pass such judgment and sentence as to the said <ORG> shall seem right The power given to the court under Clause is similar to the power given to the court of <ORG> Cases Reserved by and Vict It was considered that according to that statute if the decision of the trying court on a material point of law was reversed by the <ORG> of <ORG> Cases Reserved that court had no power to consider whether the judgment could be upheld notwithstanding its opinion on the question of law The point was one which arose as the result of the view taken by the court on a question raised in the Advocate General certificate Assuming that it was stated in the decisions relied on that the court had the right to review the case in support of the contention that it could examine the merits I would understand such language as used in the broad sense of the term review and not as placing reliance on any power of review expressly conferred by the clause These previous statements are of two kinds the statements made by the approver and to <NAME> the statements made to the Magistrate Mr <NAME> and recorded by him under Section Criminal Procedure Code It appears from the statements made by counsel on both sides that no objection was taken at the trial to the admission of the approvers <NAME> and <NAME> on the ground that they were not receivable at all as relevant under Section of the Indian Evidence Act for any purpose From the judgment of the majority of the Special Bench it appears to me to be clear that the former statements of the accomplice were admitted as corroboration within the meaning of Section illustration of the Indian Evidence Act Among these are the facts that certain statements were made by the approvers <NAME> and <NAME> to <NAME> and Inspector of Police attached to <ORG> statements which were substantially in accordance with the evidence before this Court It was contended that the evidence as to the making of these statements was not admissible and that if it was it did not corroborate the evidence of <NAME> given at the trial The reference to be oral testimony of independent witnesses and the documentary evidence in the case is certainly made as corroborative evidence within the meaning of illustration to Section and I have no doubt that the learned Judges treated the previous statements of the approvers also as corroborative evidence according to that Section Section itself states that if three accomplices between whom there was no opportunity of previous concert corroborate each other that would be a circumstance which would justify the conclusion that the accomplice is not unworthy of Credit in the particular case There is no decided case which has treated the previous statement of an accomplice as affording corroboration of his testimony within the meaning of illustration to Section But his statement whether made at the trial and in whatever shape it comes before the court is still only the statement of an accomplice and does not at all improve in value by repetition It may no doubt be said with reference to the observation that the statement of an accomplice does not improve by repetition that the previous statement in addition to proving the consistency of the witness might be of value if it was made before any pardon was tendered to the accomplice as it might weaken the suspicion attached to his testimony as being given under the temptation created by the offer of a conditional pardon But such statements seem to be admitted where a witness is charged with a design to misrepresent in consequence of some motive or friendship the previous statement being used in such a case to show that he made a similar statement before such motive existed and also where the witnesses is charged with having recently fabricated the story It is remarkable that there is really not a single case where the previous statement of an accomplice was admitted as corroborative to prove the consistency of the accomplice or for any other limited purpose or to prove that his story was not recently concocted although an accomplice would be seldom called upon to give evidence at the trial without having made a previous statement about the facts It was held by the courts in England before the enactment of the Indian Evidence Act that the accomplice should be corroborated by independent evidence as to the person of the prisoner against whom he speaks Mr <NAME> placed much reliance on Ellsom <NAME>P <NAME> concurred in the observations of <NAME> He observed that there was no authority whatever in English law which warrants the extension of the maxim that the testimony of an accomplice should be corroborated in material particulars to witnesses who are not accomplices in the proper sense of the word On the other hand in Dimes where the evidence of corroboration of an accomplice who had made a previous statement was referred to do reference was made by the same learned judge <NAME> to his previous statement as furnishing corroboration of his evidence at the trial The cases cited by Mr <NAME> do not in my opinion substantiate his contention that there are no legal rules at all governing the question of corroboration of an accomplice There was no question raised as to the kind of evidence legally necessary for corroboration The court found that there was a good deal of corroborative evidence adduced by the prosecution <NAME> <NAME> yes Cox It is therefore unnecessary to discuss the question what other rules of law are applicable in determining whether there is proper corroborative evidence in any particular case At the first hearing of the petition there was some discussion as to the nature of the corroboration required of the evidence of an accomplice The question however was not further discussed as Mr <NAME> then urged that there was no legal evidence of the bribery itself except the testimony of the accomplice I am clear that at any rate it cannot be relied on as corroborative evidence of the truth of the statements made by him at the trial This objection it is stated was not specifically taken on behalf of the accused while <NAME> was being examined as a witness by the prosecution but only at the time of the arguments Mr <NAME> asks us on this ground to refuse to deal with the objection but he admits that no objection was raised to the consideration of the point by <ORG> when it was raised by the accused was as a matter of fact cross examined by the accused at considerable length with a view to show that he had no authority to investigate the facts in question The prosecution was bound to prove the facts necessary to show that <NAME> testimony as to the previous statements made to him by and would come within the purview of Section of the Indian Evidence Act The power need not be derived from an express provision of the law as stated by the majority of <ORG> if by that expression be meant some definite statutory enactment but it must be shown that there is power under some law or other to investigate It shall be his duty to use his best endeavours to prevent all crimes offences and public nuisances to preserve the peace to apprehend disorderly and suspicious characters to detect and bring offenders to justice etc Reliance is placed on the fact that it is the duty of a police officer to detect and bring offenders to justice The Act therefore cannot be relied on to show that a police officer has any specific powers But it is contended that as Section is still in force which makes it the duty of a police officer to detect and bring offenders to justice he must be taken to have all powers necessary for the purpose and therefore to investigate offences and that every police officer has these powers throughout the <ORG> The endeavours must be made by him means of powers given to him by the law The result is that they must now discharge their duties under the powers given to them by the Criminal Procedure Code or by some other law The case would be different where a statute commands a person to do a particular act as such a command would be sufficient authority for him to do it even though it may affect other persons The learned Judges who formed the majority of <ORG> do not rest their judgment on Section of the Police Act An officer in charge of a police station has the power to investigate cognizable cases which a court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try and Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure gives the power of investigation to police officers superior in rank to an officer jn charge of a police station in cases throughout the local area to which they have been appointed The functions of the <ORG> are described in the to be generally speaking to watch widespread and dangerous movements to collect and disseminate information regarding organised crimes and gangs and to assist in the investigation of crimes which are of such a special nature that the local officers are unable to deal with them adequately without help There is again another difficulty which the prosecution has to overcome The facts deposed to by and at the trial related to the existence of a conspiracy under Section A of the Indian Penal Code an offence under that section is not a cognisable one and a police officer has no power under Sections and Criminal Procedure Code to investigate such an offence without the orders of a magistrate in that behalf It is admitted that in this case there was no such order of a magistrate But taking it that had no power under the Criminal Procedure Code to investigate the offence of conspiracy under Section A of the Indian Penal Code the question arises whether if he had authority to investigate the murder of Mr <NAME> he had not power to investigate facts which might have a connection with the murder not as disclosing another non cognisable offence but as facts which might have a possible bearing on the murder I think it is possible to hold that he had such power But as I have held that the prosecution failed to show that had legal power to investigate any facts this objection to the admissibility of the statements of and must be upheld and I abstain from deciding the question whether the absence of a magisterial order is an insuperable objection The fourth point The fourth point raised by the Advocate General is whether the statements made by and to <NAME> were not rendered inadmissible in evidence by reason of the provisions of Section of the Evidence Act The question is whether they are in admissible against the accused on the ground that they are confessions made to a police officer The finding of the majority of the Special Bench is that Section makes a confession to a police officer inadmissible only against the person making it and that the statements are therefore admissible against the accused under Section The learned Judges are of opinion that the mischief aimed at is the same in Section relating to a confession made by a person in police custody as in Section and as Section makes the confession under that section inadmissible only against the person making it the expression in Section against a person accused of any offence must also be held to mean against the pers making the confession The argument for the prosecution at the hearing before us is briefly as follows Sections to must be taken to lay down rules of admissibility only with regard to a confession made by a person charged with an offence at the trial One reason for so holding is stated to be that a confession is generally admissible only against the person making it though the legislature has made an exception by making it admissible also against a person who is being tried jointly with such person when the confession has been already put in evidence against the maker It comes to this Because a confession is admissible only against the person making it or one who is jointly tried with him therefore under Section the confessions of and were admissible against the accused who were not jointly tried with them an apparently absurd conclusion But it is contended that there is no such absurdity because apart from this reason the word confession has a well understood meaning viz Prima facie this contravenes the principle that an admission of guilt is admissible only against the person making it or one tried for an offence jointly with him If it cannot be proved how can it be admitted in evidence for any purpose Secondly when it is intended that anything not admissible under one section of the Act is not to be excluded if it be relevant under some other section the Act has expressly taken care to say so Thus Section while enacting that an admission cannot be proved by or on behalf of the person making it states in exception that it may be proved if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission Thirdly the reason why a confession made to a police officer should not be admissible is to my mind equally applicable whether it is to be used as substantive evidence or for the purpose of corroboration It will be observed that an extra judicial confession does not connote according to this definition that the statement was made by a party to the trial before the court No doubt a confession is used in evidence only against a person charged with a crime in the case before the court and only against a person making it or a co accused but this does not justify the view that the word confession itself means an admission of guilt by such a person While holding that there was nothing in the definition against his view that an admission which does amount to an acknowledgment of the commission of a crime is not a confession the learned <NAME>udge deprecated the use of a definition adopted for the purpose of an intended code in England as a guidance in construing the Indian Evidence Act The reference in Section to a person accused of an offence would be unnecessary as the word confession by itself imports according to the contention a statement by the accused before the court Section makes certain confessions inadmissible against a person accused of any offence The person accused of an offence in Section refers of course to a party to the proceeding before the court against whom the confession is sought to be used The expression made by an accused person means by one then an accused person just as proving against a person accused of an offence means proving against one who is then an accused person It was regarded apparently that it was necessary to shut out all admission of guilt made to a police officer whether the person making it was then accused of an offence or not Thus far I have dealt with the arguments on behalf of the prosecution An examination of the sections leaves no doubt in my mind that an admission of guilt made to a police officer by any person cannot be proved as against any person accused of any offence whether he be the person who made the admission or not Under Section a statement which appears to the <ORG> to have been caused by an inducement threat or promise is inadmissible both against the person making it and against others such as his co accused A confession which was not voluntary within the meaning of Section cannot be used against a co accused while it is inadmissible against the person making it He contends that the language when a confession is proved in that section means when it is admitted in evidence It could not mean this because the onus of proving this would not be on the prosecution but on the accused against whom it is sought to be used Sections and show that the Act makes a clear distinction between the proof of a confession and its relevancy It is by means of Section that a confession which is an improper one is excluded both against the person making it and against others If this conclusion is right it affords a strong argument in favour of holding that under Section also the confession is inadmissible against any accused person and not merely against the maker of the confession The one and only argument adduced against this plain construction is that Section makes a confession made not to a police officer but by a person in police custody inadmissible only against him and not against others and it is urged that there is no sufficient reason for not excluding it against others also if a statement made to a police officer is excluded against others I do not say this reason is convincing but this is not the only case where a court is unable to find convincing reasons for distinctions made by the legislature I am bound to attach more importance to the fact that very different language has been used by the legislature in two consecutive sections there is no difficulty in finding a reason for the comprehensive language used in Section I have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that the statements of and to are inadmissible in evidence I agree with <NAME> that a confession which is inadmissible against the person making it is a fortiori inadmissible against another person implicated by it The question admittedly did not arise for decision in that case Reliance is placed on the observation of <ORG> that confession in Section as in Section means a confession made by an accused person which it is proposed to prove against him to establish an offence But this does not help us for there is the same obvious difference between the languages of Sections and of the Criminal Procedure Code The fifth point The fifth and last point raised in the certificate is the question whether the evidence of of the previous statements made to him by and is inadmissible because the statements made by them to him were reduced to writing and the Writing is declared to be inadmissible in evidence on behalf of the prosecution by Section of the Criminal Procedure Code Section of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers an officer making an investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code to examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and cricumstances of the case and makes it obligatory on such person to answer questions put to him by the officer Section then enacts that the statement made by any person if taken down in writing shall not be signed by the person making it nor shall such writing be used as evidence The language of Section is too clear to my mind to justify the adoption of the argument that because the writing is declared inadmissible it must have been the intention of the legislature to shut out oral evidence also of the statement made to a police officer It is urged that the expression such writing is used in the section really to denote the statement made to the police officer which he is not prevented from taking down in writing But why did not the legislature say nor shall such statement be used as evidence instead of using the word writing Section authorizes oral statements being taken and there is no provision in that section that such oral statement cannot be proved But I think there was good reason for the legislature contenting itself with a provision that the writing should not be used The object of the legislature in Section was I think to make an exception to the rule contained in Section of the Indian Evidence Act in the case of statements made to police officers by persons examined by them at a preliminary investigation It was apparently considered unsafe to assume that a police officer making an investigation would correctly record statements made to judge discretion for the purpose of cross examining any witness called for the prosecution For instance when it is desired to prove the statement made by a witness to the investigating officer the prosecution might simply put in the written record without calling the officer But with all deference to the learned judges who decided that case I am unable to agree with them They go on to observe We are unable to see that Section of the Indian Evidence Act has any application in the matter for we do not consider that a document of this nature which moreover is not necessarily a part of the official duty of a police officer to prepare at all comes within the description of a record within the meaning of that Section I am unable to entertain any doubt that a record made by an investigating officer of statements made to him by witnesses is one prepared in the discharge of his official duty the learned judges who decided that case and with <NAME> in <NAME> King Emperor A that an examination of the corresponding sections in the previous codes of Criminal Procedure shows that the legislature deliberately restricted itself to making the writing alone inadmissible But apart from this not being a sufficient reason for refusing to give effect to the plain words of the section I can easily think of cases in which the adoption of a contrary view might result in disadvantage to the accused I have no hesitation in concurring with <ORG> in the view taken on the question by all the learned Judges who constituted the Bench With regard to the earlier statements I have entertained some doubt whether the majority of <ORG> have clearly stated that their conclusions from the evidence would be the same even if they were rejected but I am not prepared to dissent from the view that such is in substance the effect of the judgment of the learned Judges Consequently it is in my view necessary to consider whether excluding those statements there is sufficient evidence on record to sustain the conviction of the accused
