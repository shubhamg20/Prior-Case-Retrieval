THE application has been filed in a suit for permanent injunction on the basis of infringement of copyright as well as passing off The similarity between the respondent mark as compared to the applicant mark is not a matter of chance but is with deliberate intention on the part of the defendant to deceive the ultimate purchasers and by said deception to earn profits to which the defendant respondent is not entitled iii Whether the overall visual and phonetic similarity of the two marks is likely to deceive such a man or cause confusion that he may make mistake the goods of the defendant for those of the plaintiff Having noticed the principles which have to be borne in mind the application thereof is not difficult in the present case It is true that there is a phonetic difference between the numberals and but taking into account the entire get up the combination of colours it will be noted that the essential features of plaintiff containers have been absolutely copied The entire scheme of the containers is also the same It was argued by <NAME> on behalf of the defendant that there is nothing distinctive in the colour combination of the plaintiff container and the plaintiff could not have a trade mark in colour combination The definition of the mark as contained in clause of Section of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act is not exhaustive and the definition is such that there is practically no limit to the combination of various types of marks In the present case the combination of violet background and a large circle with white background and grey lettering is distinct combination of colours and there is no legal bar to a person acquiring a trade mark in such combination of colours for his containers Colour in a passenger motor car would normally be in a similar but not so conclusive a position but I see no reason why a trader as some do should not paint his delivery vans or racing cars in specific distinct colours to indicate the origin of the car or of the goods it normally carries as emanating from him The plaintiff has also claimed permanent injunction for restraining the infringement of his copy right The defendant has used the plaintiff trade mark only for three months and the balance of convenience is in favor of the plaintiff that the defendant should be injuncted by temporary injunction till the disposal of the suit from dealing in white zinc paint under the containers bearing numeral having the colour combination of violet grey and white as those of the applicant containers bearing numeral and from passing off the goods as those of the applicants in any manner
