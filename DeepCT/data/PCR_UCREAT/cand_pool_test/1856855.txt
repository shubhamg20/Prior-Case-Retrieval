The trustees did not state how they had any right to take possession of the lands We express no opinion on the question whether in the case of such a grant the trustees would have such a right But the matter was one which should have been tried and could not be decided on any assumption Again the District Judge has assumed that a minor a female and a person unlearned in the Vedas would lose the right to the service in the temple there is no basis for the assumption the onus would be on the Dharmakartas to prove any such disqualification services in temples are often performed by proxies As the case has not been properly tried we set aside the decree of <ORG> and remand the suit for fresh disposal according to law after recording all the evidence that either party may adduce The costs of this appeal will abide the result
