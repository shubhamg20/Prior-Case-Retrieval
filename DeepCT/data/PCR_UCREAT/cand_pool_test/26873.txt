Rule of the rules provides for relaxation of rules relating to appointment and qualifications and one of the instances of relaxation is when the <ORG> for reasons to be recorded in writing appoints an officer holding a post of equivalent grade by transfer from any other service of the <ORG> A The <ORG> <ORG> has no power to make a rule for regular rising an appointment under Art of the Constitution since the Article speaks of rules for appointment and general conditions of service Regu larisation of appointment by stating that notwithstanding any rules the appointment is regularised strikes at the root of existing rules prescribing promotion selection or competitive examination as methods of recruitment for regularisation would itself be a form of recruitment read with reference to the power under Art Articles and operate in different areas and when the <ORG> acted under Art Ratification or regularisation is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the authority and there has been some noncompliance with procedure which does not go to the root of the appointment Article does not confer either the power of regularisation nor the power to make rules for the recruitment or conditions of service Therefore it cannot be said that he was substantively appointed to the post of Principal If the respondent was appointed as a temporary measure to the post of Principal it would not therefore be as a local candidate but as a <ORG> servant appointed to another post as a temporary measure As the appellant and others were not given equal opportunity and treatment in regard to the appointment there was discrimination The Rules impeached by the appellant are as follows In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article of the Constitution of India and all other powers enabling him in this behalf the Governor of Mysore hereby makes the following rules namely There were other petitions before <ORG> similarly challenging the aforesaid Service Rule In the year the appellant made an application under Article challenging the officiating appointment of the respondent The contention of the respondent before <ORG> was that the appointment to a civil post could be made in three ways one by promotion second by direct recruitment and the third by regularisation of an appointment which had been initially made irregularly It Was also contended in <ORG> though there was no suggestion in the affidavit or in the return in answer to the petition that the respondent was a local candidate in service and therefore under rule A of the Mysore Civil Services Rules the rules would not apply to the respondent and the regularisation as valid <ORG> also held that when the respondent was appointed temporarily in there were no qualifications prescribed for the post and there were no cadre and recruitment rules At the relevant time in the month of February the Mysore <ORG> Civil Service General Recruitment Rules were in existence inasmuch as those rules came into force on February First if it is to a selection post or to a post to be filled by promotion or by selection of a person on the basis of merit and suitability in all respects to discharge the duties of the post it is with due regard to seniority from among persons eligible for promotion In the month of February the respondent was on deputation and having a lien on post as Assistant Lecturer of Geology when he was appointed to officiate as Principal <ORG> and therefore it could not be said that he was substantively appointed to the post of a Principal It is not the case of the Government that it was a case of promotion because there is no material to show that merit and suitability in all respects with due regard to seniority from among persons eligible for promotion were considered The Mysore <ORG> Civil Services Rules in Rule speaks of relaxation of rules relating to appointment and qualifications and one of the instances of relaxation is that the Government may for reasons to be recorded in writing a i appoint to a post an officer of <ORG> <ORG> or <ORG> or <ORG> of any other <ORG> and ii an officer holding a post of an equivalent grade by transfer from any other service of the <ORG> Equivalent grade fined in the more Civil Services Rules which came into effect on February It was said that in the month of February there were no classes The Mysore Technical Education Rules which came into existence on May referred to two classes and the Principal <ORG> was in Class I and the Heads or Principal of Polytechnics were in Class I In the post of Assistant Geologist was in Class III and not identical in rank The respondent alleged that he was appointed temporarily to the post of Principal <ORG> in February and thereafter he was appointed under Article of the Constitution because of his qualifications It will appear from the affidavit evidence that the appellant in was Principal of <ORG> at Davangere and was in the grade of Rs There were other petitioners before <ORG> who were senior to the respondent When the appellant made an application to <ORG> in the year the application was dismissed because it was found to be premature as the <ORG> was preparing the cadre and recruitment rules <NAME> It was contended on behalf of the State that under Article of the Constitution the State has power to make a rule regularising the appointment Assume that Rules under Article could be made in respect of appoint ment of one man but there are two limitations Article speaks of rules for appointment and general conditions of service It was contended on behalf of the State that Rule of the Mysore State Civil Services Rules spoke of method of recruitment to be by competitive examination or by selection or by promotion The method of recruitment and qualifications for each State Civil Service were to be set forth in the rules of recruitment but there were no rules until the year It was said on behalf of the respondent that he was the only eligible candidate in and therefore his appointment was valid The State made rules in the year to regularise the appointment from the month of February The notification of the <ORG> under Article was issued on March there validating the action taken in retiring the respondent and others upon their attaining the age of years This Court did not express any opinion as to the power of the <ORG> to make a retrospective provision under Article but the notification retiring certain persons on superannuation was struck down by this Court in these words We are of opinion that this notification cannot be said to be a rule regulating the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to the services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> The contention on behalf of the <ORG> that a rule under Article for regularisation of the appointment of a person would be a form of recruitment read with reference to power under Article is unsound and unacceptable The executive has the power to appoint That power may have its source in Article In the present case the rule which regularised the appointment of the respondent with effect from February notwithstanding any rules cannot be said to be in exercise of power under Article First Article does not speak of rules whereas Article speaks of rules Therefore the present case touches the power of the <ORG> to make rules under Article of the nature impeached here under Article the Government cannot be said to have acted also under Article in the same breath The two Articles operate in different areas Counsel on behalf of the respondent contended that regularisation would mean conferring the quality of permanence on the appointment whereas counsel on behalf of the <ORG> contended that regularisation did not mean permanence but that it was a case of regularisation of the rules under Article Ratification or regularisation is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the authority but there has been some non compliance with procedure or manner which does not go to the root of the appointment To accede to such a proposition would be to introduce a new head of appointment in defiance of rules or it may have the effect of setting at naught the rules In the present case it was said that the respondent was a local candidate within the meaning of rule A of the Mysore Civil Services Rules which came into effect on March A contention was advanced on behalf of the respondents that Rules and in the Mysore <ORG> Civil Service Rules which came into effect on February would not apply until rules of recruitment as con templated in Rule were brought into existence It was contended that the appointments there were to have been in consonance with the Rules which came into existence in December It was held that the December Rules were not intended to cover appointments of persons who had been interviewed and recommended for appointment by <ORG> in the month of November prior to the making of the rules It was also held in that case that the absence of rules would not take away the power of the executive Government to make appointments under Article of the Constitution The <ORG> relied on the affidavit of the Deputy Secretary to the Government that the respondent was a highly qualified person and there were no other qualified persons available to fill up the post of Principal of the School It was therefore said that the Government found that the respondent was the only candidate found suitable and he was therefore selected There were three classes of services under the Mysore Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules The Government has power to relax any rule and may appoint persons for reasons to be recorded in writing inter alia to a post of an equivalent grade by transfer It is said on behalf of the State that the appointment of the respondent was justified on the following grounds The Government has power to make a temporary appointment Up to the year there were no rules fixed with regard to cadre or appointment There were no specific rules for regularisation Secondly the modes of appointments are direct recruitment or selection or pro motion or appointing for reasons to be recorded in writing an officer holding a post of an equivalent grade by transfer from any other service of the <ORG> The contention of the <ORG> that there were no rules and that the Government was free to appoint the respondent is wrong There were rules which spoke of appointment by competitive examination or by selection or by promotion Article does not confer power on the Government to make rules for the recruitment or conditions of service Counsel on behalf of the appellant contended that Articles and of the Constitution were infringed by the impugned regularisation by rules under Article of the Constitution inasmuch as the appellant and the other petitioners in <ORG> were not given equal opportunity and treatment in regard to the appointment and there was also discrimination It was said on behalf of the respondent that the appellant did not possess qualifications prescribed by the Rules The Rules provided appointment by promotion or by direct recruitment
