The second category is divided into two sub categories a officers appointed as a result of a competitive examination and officers appointed by promotion in accordance with of the Recruitment Rules But if an officer started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officers was recruited to the Service by competition the year of allotment had to be determined ad hoc by <ORG> under proviso to and under proviso to the period of officiation before the date of inclusion of the name of an officer in the Select List prepared in accordance with the requirements of <ORG> Appointment by Promotion Regulations would be counted only if such period was approved by <ORG> in consultation with <ORG> The appellant challenged the order by a petition under Art In view of the facts that he was officiating for eight years that he had never been reverted and that he was appointed to the post when vacancies fell The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the Circuit Bench of <ORG> at Delhi dismissing in limine the petition under art The appellant claims that a wrong year of allotment has been given to him by the application of the impugned order which according to him is a void order Every officer shall be assigned a year of allotment in accordance with the provisions hereinafter contained in this rule The year of allotment of an officer in service at the commencement of these rules shall be the same as has been assigned to him or may be assigned to him by <ORG> in accordance with the orders and instructions in force immediately before the commencement of these rules Provided that where the year of allotment of an officer appointed in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules has not been determined prior to the commencement of these Rules his year of allotment shall be determined in accordance with the provision in clause of sub rule of this rule and for this purpose such officer shall be deemed to have officiated in a senior post only if and for the period for which he was approved for such officiation by <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> The year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these rules shall be a where the officer is appointed to the Service on the results of a competitive examination the year following the year in which such examination was held where the officer is appointed to the Service by promotion in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules the year of allotment of the junior most among the officers recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those Rules who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the former Provided that the year of appointment of an officer appointed to the Service in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules who started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officers recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those Rules so started officiating shall be determined ad hoc by <ORG> in consultation with the State Government concerned Provided further that an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these Rules in accor dance with rule of the Recruitment Rules shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post prior to the date of the inclusion of his name in the Select List prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Indian Police Service Appointment by Promotion Regulations framed under rule of the Recruitment Rules if the period of such officiation prior to that date is approved by <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> An officer shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post from a certain date if during the period from that date to the date of his confirmation in the senior grade he continues to hold without any break or reversion as senior post otherwise than as a purely temporary or local arrangement An officer shall be treated as having officiated in a senior post during any period in respect of which <ORG> concerned certifies that he would have so officiated but for his absence on leave or appointment to any special post of any other exceptional circumstance The Rule then divides officers into two categories an officer in <ORG> at the commencement of the Rules and an officer appointed to <ORG> after the commencement of the Rules The second category is again divided into two sub categories a officer appointed to the service as a result of a competitive examination and officer appointed to the service by promotion in accordance with Rule of the Recruitment Rules As the appellant was appointed to the Service by promotion we are concerned with the second sub category The formula adopted works out as follows first find out the year of allotment of the junior most among the officers recruited to the service by competition who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of officiation of the appellant The first period can only be counted if such period is approved by <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> We will deal with this aspect later but for the time being we assume that there is no force in <ORG> contention and the Explanation does not apply to the facts of the present case While recruitment to the Service through these diverse unconventional sources was being made over the years the question of fixation of seniority and year of allotment was subseqently considered and instructions were issued vide Shri <NAME> letter No AIS dated nd June prescribing the detailed procedure as to how the seniority and the year of allotment of each officer and for each category of recruitment should be fixed At this stage it was noticed that there still were some <ORG> Officers who had not qualified at the various recruitments made for the <ORG> in previous years and continued to hold senior posts on account of paucity of officers It was further realised that if for determination of seniority and year of allotment the principle of date of continuous officiation is applied in such case such <ORG> Officers who had been rejected on earlier occasions would on eventual absorption into the <ORG> through the regular promotion quota become entitled to higher seniority and year of allotment than those who had been selected in preference to them at the time of the promotions made and the Special Recruitment held in earlier years In consultation with <ORG> and with <ORG> it was therefore decided that in the case of <ORG> Officers appointed to the <ORG> after th May their officiation prior to this date would not count for purposes of seniority and year of allotment It may be mentioned that this date refers to the finalisation of the Gradation List for the <ORG> but since the same principles were extended to the <ORG> as well it was decided to retain this as the crucial date It may be reiterated that this decision was taken after consultation with the State Governments and the I would say that there is no arbitrariness in this matter and that this was done after consulting all concerned and after evolving a sound principle which would be consistent with the view that those who had been selected for recruitment on earlier occasions should not by application of a principle become junior to those who on such occasions had been rejected It would be noticed that the date May to begin with had nothing to do with the finlisation of the Gradation List of <ORG> because it was a date which had reference to the finalisation of the Gradation List for the <ORG> Further this date does not seem to have much relevance to the question of avoiding the anomalous position mentioned in para of the affidavit reproduced above The Central <ORG> cannot pick out a date from a hat and that is what it seems to have done in this case and say that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by the Central <ORG> within the second proviso We have already discussed this point above and in our opinion there is no force in this contention As we have said <ORG> must consider the question of approval of the officiation period and come to an ad hoc decision after considering all the relevant circumstances in consultation with <ORG> concerned and fix the year of allotment All officers thus recruited to the Service were initially appointed in the Junior Scale of the I The result was that there were some senior posts that had to be filled and some State Polic Service Officers who had not been selected to the Service through any of the above recruitment methods were in view of the existing paucity of officers allowed to officiate on senior posts as a stop gap arrangement I say that all such <ORG> Officers who were officiating on senior posts due to shortage of officers were primarily those who had been considered for absorption into the <ORG> under the Promotion Quota or under the Emergency Recruitment but had not been found fit for such absorption Further the fact that he was appointed to the post at the time when vacancies fell negatives that it was merely a temporary arrangement The respondent will pay costs of the appellant in this appeal
