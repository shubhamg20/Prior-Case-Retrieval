The first point urged by Mr <NAME> in support of this appeal is that the learned District Judge was wrong in recalling the order inasmuch as the order was good in law though it was made ex parte and <ORG> Calcutta has no power to execute decrees exceeding Rs Mr <NAME> contention is that the view taken by the learned District Judge is wrong inasmuch as there is no limitation as regards the pecuniary jurisdiction in cases coming under Section Clause i Civil His argument is that Clause ii of the said Section expressly refers to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> but Clause i does not mention anything about the competency of the <ORG> The opening words of Clause i of Section are in these terms The <ORG> which passed a decree may on the application of the decree holder send it for execution to another <ORG> that of a Munsif or a Subordinate Judge and consequently a decree passed by a Subordinate Judge can be transferred for execution to the <ORG> of a Munsif Section of the Code runs thus Save in so far as is otherwise expressly provided nothing herein contained shall operate to give any <ORG> jurisdiction over suits the amount or value of the subject matter of which exceeds the pecuniary limits if any of its ordinary jurisdiction There is no express provision in Section Clause i that the transferee Court may be a Court of any pecuniary jurisdiction The transferee Court contemplated by Section must be therefore a Court of competent jurisdiction that is a Court which has the same pecuniary jurisdiction as the transferor Court Mr <NAME> next contended that the learned District Judge had no jurisdiction to set aside an order made by the Subordinate Judge rejecting the judgment debtor objection to the order of transfer There is nothing in the law which precludes him from raising his objection to the said ex parte order under Section of the Code The District Judge had therefore jurisdiction to set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge
