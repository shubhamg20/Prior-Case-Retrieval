DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH JAGANNADHA RAO SHAH SETHI JJ JUDGMENT JUDGMENT Supp SCR The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHA RAO <NAME> granted These appeals arising out of SLP Nos of hereinafter called the main batch are directed against the judgment of <ORG> dated in Application No of and of The facts in the main batch of Civil appeals are as follows In a group of OAs filed before the <ORG> the basic contention raised by the applicants appellants in this Court who were general candidates was that when they and the reserved candidates were appointed at level and the Junior reserved candidates got promoted earlier at roster points to level and again by way of roster points to level and when the senior general candidate got promoted in due course to level then the general candidate would become senior to the reserved candidate at level The above contention raised by the appellants before us was rejected by <ORG> in its judgment under appeal It held on a consideration of Rule and A and Article of the Karnataka Government Servants Seniority Rules that the reserved candidates promoted on the basis of roster at Levels and would become seniors from the date of the roster point promotions and even if a senior general candidate reached Level later he would not be able to claim seniority over the reserved candidate at Level because the reserved candidate had reached Level earlier After hearing learned senior counsel Sri <NAME> for the applicant in IA and Dr <NAME> for the respondents we have come to the conclusion that the hearing of the present batch need not be postponed because of the pendency of the said IA filed in <NAME> We shall now deal with the points in the main batch of appeals preferred by the general candidates We shall first refer to the rules relating to seniority The said Rules of read as follows Rule Seniority inter se persons appointed on temporary basis will be determined by the dates of their continuous officiation in that grade and where the period of officiation is the same the seniority inter se in the lower grade shall prevail Rule When promotion to a class of post or cadre ere made on the basis of seniority cum merit at the same time the relative seniority shall be determined i if promotions are made from any one cadre of class of post by their seniority inter se in the lower cadre or class of post ii if promotions are made from several cadres or classes of posts of the same grade by the period of service in those grades iii if promotions are made from several cadres or classes of posts the grades of which are not the same by the order in which the candidates are arranged by the authority making the promotion in consultation with <ORG> where such consultation is necessary taking into consideration the order in which promotions are to be made from those several cadres or classes of posts There is no specific rule here permitting seniority to be counted in respect of a roster promotion In Ajit Singh I SCC a circular which gave seniority to the roster point promotees was held to be violative of Articles and which was later decided this Court used the words it is open to the <ORG> and it gave an impression that the <ORG> could give seniority to roster point promotees It was held that seniority Rules like Rules and A permitting seniority to be counted from date of initial promotion govern normal promotions made according to rules by seniority at basic level by seniority cum fitness or by seniority cum merit or by selection but not to promotions made by way of roster SCC at while holding that if creamy layer among backward classes were given same benefits as Backward classes it will amount to treating equals unequally Therefore if seniority is given it will violate the equality principle which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution The general candidates had a right under Articles and to be considered for promotion as Superintending Engineers as seniors to the reserved candidates While considering the promotions of the reserved candidates at Level Junior Engineer called later as Assistant Engineer and at Level Assistant Executive Engineer the principles laid down in <NAME> case have also to be kept in mind as explained in <NAME> However in <NAME> reversions were directed not to be made in respect of reserved candidates promoted on basis of roster point seniority before In other words notwithstanding the review of seniority at various levels starting from the level of Executive Engineer and the consequent downgradation of seniority if any at that level any promotion of a reserved candidate to the post of Superintending Engineer which took place before contrary to principles now laid down in <NAME> should not be disturbed That has also to be borne in mind In our view the general directions given in this judgment will be sufficient for the purposes of disposal of these appeals It was also stated that one Sri A Audi a reserved candidate is now posted as Secretary in the <ORG> and that therefore there is no need to pass any orders Following the same we set aside the judgment of the <ORG> and direct that the seniority lists and promotions be reviewed as per the directions given above subject of course to the restriction that those who were promoted before on principles contrary to <NAME> need not be reverted and those who were promoted contrary to Sabharwal before need not be reverted This limited protection against reversion was given to those reserved candidates who were promoted contrary to the law laid down in the above cases to avoid hardship
