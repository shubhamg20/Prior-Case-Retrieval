Upon this confession being tendered in evidence it was objected to by the prisoner Counsel upon the ground that it was a confession made by the prisoner to a police officer and therefore not admissible by reason of the th section of the Evidence Act I of It was urged by Mr <NAME> for the prisoner that the terms of Section are imperative that a confession made to a police officer under any circumstances is not admissible in evidence against him and that the th section is not intended to qualify the th but means that no confession made by a prisoner in custody to any person other than a police officer shall be admissible unless made in the presence of a Magistrate It is an enactment to which the <ORG> should give the fullest effect and I see no sufficient reason for reading the th section so as to qualify the plain meaning of the th There is no doubt that looking at the various sections of Beng Act IV of the Deputy Commissioner of Police is not a member of <ORG> within the meaning of that Act and moreover on looking back to the Police Act of it will be found that the term police officer as used in that Act has generally the same meaning as a member of <ORG> in the Act of but in construing the th section of the Evidence Act of I consider that the term police officer should be read not in any strict technical sense but according to its more comprehensive and popular meaning In common parlance and amongst the generality of people the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Police are understood to be officers of police or in other words police officers quite as much as the more ordinary members of the force and although in the case of a gentleman in Mr <NAME> position there would not be of course the same danger of a confession being extorted from a prisoner by any undue means there is no doubt that Mr <NAME> official character and the very place where he sits as Deputy Commissioner is not without its terrors in the eyes of an accused person and I think it better in construing a section such as the th which was intended as a wholesome protection to the accused to construe it in its widest and most popular signification But then comes the further very important question what should be the effect of this improper admission of evidence on the proceedings The th section of the Evidence Act provides that the improper admission of evidence shall not be ground of itself for the reversal of any decision in any case fi it shall appear to the <ORG> before which such objection is raised that independently of the evidence objected to and admitted there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision and I was certainly disposed to think before hearing Mr <NAME> argument not only that this section applied to criminal as well as civil cases but that the <ORG> which had to determine whether independently of the evidence objected to there were sufficient materials to justify a conviction was the <ORG> below before which the case was originally tried and upon this assumption my learned colleague and I consulted <NAME> who certified that there was ample evidence in the <ORG> below independently of the admission to justify the conviction in this case Mr <NAME> however desired to be heard upon the effect of Section and he had urged upon us first that the section does not apply at all to criminal cases and secondly that if it does the <ORG> to determine whether the conviction ought to stand is not the <ORG> which tried the case but the <ORG> before whom the point of the admissibility of the evidence was argued I am unable however to discover any sufficient reason why the th section of the Evidence Act should not apply to criminal as well as civil cases It is perfectly true that the word decision is more generally used as applicable to civil proceedings but it is by no means inappropriate to criminal cases and if it was the intention of the <ORG> to use an expression which would apply equally to civil as to criminal proceedings there is probably no other word which would have answered their purpose better Many other provisions of the Evidence Act apply equally to all judicial enquiries and if the nature of the mischief which the section was intended to remedy is considered there is at least as much reason why it should apply to criminal as to civil proceedings The <ORG> have no power in a criminal case to order a new trial and if in each instance where evidence is improperly admitted or rejected the conviction is to be quashed a lamentable failure of justice would often be the consequence I am of opinion therefore that Section does apply to criminal cases but upon consideration I think that the Court mentioned in that section which is to decide upon the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction is <ORG> and not the Court below Apart however from Section of the Evidence Act I think that under Section of the Letters Patent by virtue of which this case has been submitted to us for review we have a right either to quash or to confirm the conviction as we may think proper If therefore upon reviewing the whole case we are of opinion that upon the evidence properly received there is sufficient ground to convict the prisoner I consider that we ought to allow the conviction to stand In the present case therefore we have obtained copies of the Judge notes at the trial and have also obtained information from the Judge as to what particular portion of the evidence applied to the prisoner <NAME> and we are now prepared to hear the case argued upon its merits as to whether there is sufficient evidence apart from that improperly admitted to support the conviction Without going so far as to say that Section of the Evidence Act renders inadmissible a confession made to any person connected with the police for there are cases in which a person holding high judicial office has control over and is the nominal head of the police in his district I think that in the present case it was impossible for Mr <NAME> residing in the house allotted to him as Deputy Commissioner of Police and surrounded by police immediately under his control to divest himself of his character of a police officer I also agree that under Clause of the Letters Patent which clause deals with cases tried before a jury we are bound to consider the admissible evidence in this case and to pass such judgment and sentence as we shall think right and I come to this conclusion without reference to Section of the Evidence Act I agree that such last mentioned section is applicable to criminal trials but I have some doubt whether if we were proceeding under it alone we should be the proper <ORG> to consider the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in relation to the verdict A certificate by a majority of the jury who tried the case to the effect that if the confession had not been in evidence they would have given a verdict of acquittal was tendered but was rejected by the <ORG>
