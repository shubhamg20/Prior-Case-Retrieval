of the total income as reduced by the amounts mentioned in Section A of the said Act and the assessee as such was entitled to a notice under Section A ii thereof The facts giving rise to this question may be briefly summarised The assessee <ORG> is a private limited company to which the provisions of Section A are applicable On appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner there was an interim order dated December by which he asked for a report from the Income tax Officer The <ORG> came to the conclusion that the exposure of the film was one of the stages of taking and producing of the photograph and that when admittedly developing of the exposed film was processing there was every justification to treat the exposure of the film itself as part of the proceeding As will be clear from the facts stated above the answers to the questions mainly depend on an interpretation of Section A of the Income tax Act The answer primarily must depend on the correct interpretation of Section A of the Income tax Act read with the relevant provisions of the Finance Act First the words in respect of any previous year secondly distributed within months immediately following the expiry of the previous year thirdly are less than the statutory percentage of the total income fourthly of that previous year Section A of the Income tax Act inter alia provides as follows Where the Income tax Officer is satisfied that in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends by any company within the months immediately following the expiry of that previous year are less than the statutory percentage of the total income of the company of that previous year The third consideration is that it is not with regard to dividends actually declared or proposed by the company itself but which the Income tax Officer thinks should have been distributed The distribution period is expressly said to be within the months immediately following the expiry of that previous year These considerations lead to the conclusion that the <ORG> was right in holding that the statutory percentage operating for the previous year was the right and proper statutory percentage to apply in this case There are some other considerations bearing on this point Section of the Finance Act which received the assent of the President on the th April provides The second relevant section is Section of the Finance Act which provides The amendments to the Income tax Act made by Section Section Clause ii of Section Section Section Section Section and Section shall have effect on and from the st day of April In short its effect is that this Section says that the amendment made by Section of the Finance Act in Section A of the Income tax Act shall have effect on and from the st day of April Now reading Section and Section of the Finance Act it seems to follow that the substitution was to take effect in future and that it would take effect from the st April It was not amended or repealed in that sense but it preserved its vitality and effect until the st April as expressly indicated by the language used in Section and Section But then Mr <NAME> for the revenue here raised another consideration for this court by relying on Section of the Finance Act which says Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub section or Sub section in relation to dividends declared or payable by a company in respect of any previous year relevant to any assessment year prior to the assessment year the Income tax Act shall have effect as if the amendments contained in Section Section Section Section Section Section Section and Section had not been made The primary reason for not accepting is that Section of the Finance Act was only speaking of dividends declared or payable by a company Section A of the Income tax Act and therefore Section of the Finance Act of do not deal with dividends declared or payable by a company On the construction itself as I have said it is clear that Section deals only with dividends declared or payable by a company and not such dividends as mentioned in Section A of the Income tax Act It is plain that under Section A of the Income tax Act what the Income tax Officer considers is first the dividend actually distributed by the company with the months immediately following the expiry of the previous year and secondly whether that distribution is less than the statutory percentage of the total income of the company of that previous year It is possible that when the company has distributed dividends it could not anticipate what amendments in rates if at all would be proposed by the Finance Act No doubt it covers a whole period of months following the expiry of the previous year which in this case would include the last two or three months on the dates mentioned above This brings me to the consideration of another aspect of this problem If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter The case is thus one where the statute purports to operate only prospectively but such operations as under the scheme of the Indian income tax law could take into account income earned before the statute came into force Such an enactment cannot strictly speaking be said to be retroactive legislation though its operation may affect acts done in the past The total income of the assessee during the previous year is computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income tax Act after giving the relevant allowances and deductions therefrom If during the assessment year an individual is assessable to tax the fact that during the previous year he was not liable to tax at all because there was no Income tax Act in the area to which the Act was extended or because that under an Income tax Act in force therein during that year his income was exempted from tax or because of any other law including International law he was so exempt from tax would not be of any relevance Dr <NAME> appearing for the assessee tried to draw a distinction based on the theory that all these cases were really on the basis of the charging sections like Section of the Income tax Act and he tried to distinguish such a charging section as Section of the Income tax Act from Section A of the Income tax Act which is not a charging section but a section creating a statutory liability for super tax under certain circumstances on the dividends mentioned here But whether that distinction is followed or not need not deter us because we are of the view that legislation must be interpreted on its own terms and having regard to the language used in Section A of the Income tax Act and Sections and of the Finance Act of we have come to the conclusion that quite independent of any consideration of retrospective or retroactive or prospective legislation the point is quite clear that the statutory percentage rate remained operative and was to be the rate applicable by reason of the fact that the higher amended rate did not come into effect until st April indicating thereby that the old statutory percentage was effective until April Under Section A there is no statutory charge in respect of additional super tax and the liability is imposed by the order of the Income tax Officer This case proceeds to point out that the source of the liability to pay additional super tax is not Sections and of the Act it lies in and arises out of the order of the Income tax Officer For the reasons and on the authorities stated above we answer the first question in the affirmative in favour of the assessee and hold that the <ORG> was right in applying the statutory percentage rates of and in respect of processing receipts and trading receipts respectively There is some force in the argument of Mr <NAME> for the revenue in this branch of the case In the first place it raises the question whether the exposure of the film is one of the stages of the whole process of taking and developing the photograph specially in the light of the distinction made between the trading activities of the assessee and his other activities viz The second question as stated above raised the problem of shortfall in the distribution of dividend by the assessee and whether such shortfall was less than of the total income as reduced by the amounts mentioned in Section A of the Income tax Act Whether the shortfall was less than would depend on the amount of processing receipts and trading receipts Whether it is so or not in a particular case depends on the facts
