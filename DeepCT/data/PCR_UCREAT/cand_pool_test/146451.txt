On a representation made by respondent No on for a remission in the amount at which the settlement had been made in his favour on the ground that he had suffered a heavy loss during the year as a result of the unlawful activities of the members of the appellant society or in the alternative for continuance of fishery rights for the years and the <ORG> made the deposit by respondent No of one year settlement fee at Rs It was also made clear that in case the appellant failed to make the deposit aforesaid the settlement be issued by highest bid Though <ORG> found that there was no binding or enforceable contract between respondent No and <ORG> it allowed the writ petition relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel In order that mandamus may issue to compel the parties to do something it must be shown that there is a statute which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party has a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance Constitution and the High court was not competent to issue the same when it has not been shown that there is any statute or rule having the force of law which casts a duty on the respondents to which they fail to perform The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated August of <ORG> at Patna in Civil Writ Judicial Case No of filed by respondent No restraining the appellant and respondents to herein from acting on the basis of letter No dated June addressed by <ORG> <ORG> to the Deputy Commissioner <NAME> Dumka which formed Annexure to the aforesaid writ petition and directing respondent No to execute the lease of the fishery rights in question in favour of respondent No and to put him in possession thereof if not already done The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are The appellant which is a co operative society commenced taking settlement of Gangapath Islampur <ORG> bearing Tauzi No hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> immediately after its establishment and in the amount at which the settlement had been made in his favour on the ground that he had suffered a heavy loss during the aforesaid period of settlement as a result of the unlawful activities of the members of the appellant society In the alternative he prayed that in case the State <ORG> was not in a position to grant the remission the settlement of fishery rights of the <ORG> be continued with him for a further period of three years at the same amount in order to enable him to recoup the aforesaid loss suffered by him A copy of this communication was also sent to respondent No with the direction that he should deposit Rs on May vide challan No Bank dated May and by his letter of the even date he requested the Sub Divisional Officer Sahibganj to issue the <NAME> of settlement of the <ORG> for the years and in his favour How ever taking a favourable view of the representations made by the appellant on February and March to its Revenue Minister and the Chief Minister respectively <ORG> changed its mind and informed the Deputy Commissioner of Santhal Paragana Dumka vide its letter No dated June that it had taken the decision that settlement of the aforesaid <ORG> with the Society i the appellant be done for the year on the additional conditions besides those laid down by the prescribed rules and conditions that it would make the de posit of all earlier arrears of Rs It was made clear in the concluding part of the communication that in case the appellant failed to makethe deposit as aforesaid the settlement be issued by highest bid Averring that he had been put to a considerable financial loss as a result of the aforesaid subsequent order of the <ORG> settling the fishery rights in <ORG> in favour of the appellant respondent No filed a petition under Article of the Constitution in <ORG> at Patna on July praying that the aforesaid order settling the fishery rights of the <ORG> with the appellant be quashed by a writ of certiorari and the State <ORG> be directed by a writ of mandamus to execute the lease in his favour for the years and and not to disturb his possession over the fishery right in question during the currency of the term of the lease The respondent also prayed for such other orders as the Court might think fit and proper In the counter affidavit jointly filed by them in opposition to the petition respondents Nos to averred inter alia that there was no completed contract and hence no formal agreement was executed between the <ORG> The respondents also denied their liability for the expenses alleged to have been incurred by respondent No in connection with the preparation for the lease ordered in his favour by the <ORG> vide the aforesaid Annexure to the writ petition <ORG> while holding that there was no binding or enforceable contract between respondent No and <ORG> allowed the writ petition relying on the doctrine of promissory estopped Aggrieved by this judgment and order the appellant has as already stated come up in appeal to this Court Appearing on behalf of the appellant Mr <NAME> has urged the following points That since there was no completed binding and enforceable contract between the State of Bihar and respondent No as contemplated by Article of the Constitution the aforesaid writ petition filed by respondent No was not maintainable That to a case like the present one the doctrine of promissory estopped had no application and <ORG> has erred in relying upon the same That in any case since there was no breach of any statutory duty in the present case a writ of mandamus could not have been issued by <ORG> Mr <NAME> has on the other hand submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case <ORG> was justified in applying the principle of promissory estoppel and there is no warrant for interfering with the judgment and order passed by <ORG> We shall deal seriatim with the aforesaid three contentions raised on behalf on the appellant But before attempting to do that we would like to dispose of the preliminary objection raised on behalf of respondent No to the effect that as the period for which the impugned order dated June settling the Jalkar with the appellant was issued has expired and the State has not chosen to prefer any appeal against the aforesaid We accordingly overrule the preliminary objection and proceed to consider the aforesaid contentions raised on behalf of the appellant That apart there is an additional reason for holding that the settlement of Jalkar with respondent No was not valid and enforceable If a profit a prendre is tangible immovable property its sale has to be by means of a registered instrument in case its value exceeds Rs Even if the settlement of Jalkar with respondent No is regarded as lease as described by him in Annexure to the writ petition it would not make any difference because a lease of fishery which is immovable property as defined by section of the Registration Act if it is for any term exceeding one year or reserves a yearly rent has also to be registered as required by section of the Indian Registration Act and section of the Transfer of Property Act The decision of this Court in <ORG> <ORG> on which strong reliance is placed by counsel for respondent No is clearly distinguishable In that case unlike the present one the respondents were not seeking to enforce any contractual right ance with the obligation which was laid upon the Textile Commissioner by the terms of the Export Promotion Scheme providing for grant by way of incentives to exporters of woollen textiles and goods of Entitlement Certificate to import raw materials of a total amount equal to of the value of their exports Their claim was founded upon the equity which arose in their favour as a result of the representation made on behalf of the Government in the aforesaid Scheme the exports of woollen goods made by them Lo Afghanistan acting upon the representation and curtailment of the import Entitlement by the Textile There is abundant authority in favour of the proposition that a writ of mandamus can be granted only in a case where there is a statutory duty imposed upon the officer concerned and there is a failure on the part of that officer to discharge the statutory obligation It follows therefore that in order that mandamus may issue to compel the authorities to do something it must be shown that there is a statute which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party has a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance In the instant case it has not been shown by respondent No that there is any statute or rule having the force of law which casts a duty on respondents to which they failed to perform This brings us to the consideration of the last question of the relief which can be granted to the appellant appellant for the remainder of the year at of the highest bid amount i less of the highest auction amount but it may not be possible for it to do so in face of the impediment created by the mandamus issued by <ORG> we would allow the appeal in so far as the current year is concerned and leave it open to the Government to grant the fishery rights to the appellant in conformity with the aforesaid policy and procedure in case the latter fulfills the conditions laid down therein In the event of the Government settling the Jalkar with the appellant or any other <ORG> in accordance with the policy and procedure laid down in the aforesaid circular letter it shall on the basis of section of the Contract Act refund to respondent No proportionate amount of the <ORG> deposited by him for the year after going into the accounts which he was bound to maintain under order passed by this Court on May for the period commencing from May to August
