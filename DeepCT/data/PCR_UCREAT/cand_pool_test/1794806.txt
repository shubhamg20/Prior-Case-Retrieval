This appeal by the defendant is directed against the judgment and decree of eviction passed by the Additional District Judge <ORG> Ali pore affirming the judgment and decree of the trial Court in a suit for eviction of the defendant on revocation of his licence as a licensee It was alleged that the father of the defendant was also a tenant in the suit premises and that the plaintiff accepted the defendant as a tenant in respect of the said room only after taking a sum of Rs So the fact remains that the plaintiff respondent was still a tenant and not the owner of the suit premises at the time the suit was instituted in the year Be it stated here at the very outset that in a case of concurrent findings of fact by both the courts below the scope of interference by <ORG> is very limited and <ORG> should not interfere with the concurrent findings of facts of the Courts below on the ground of perversity unless the court concerned misdirected itself In coming to its finding on the question of fact Reference may be made in this connection to the decision of <ORG> In view of the contentions of the learned Advocate for the defendant appellant it will be necessary to see as to whether the possession which was given to the defendant appellant was that of a licensee or that of a tenant Further in view of the points raised by the learned Advocate for the defendant appellant the entire relevant evidence on record is to be considered to see that the <ORG> below considered all such important evidence having direct bearing on the disputed issue But we should also bear in mind that it has the power to interfere with such finding when the lower appellate Court made a mistake of the nature as stated and can decide the issue treating such finding as unwarranted and then it can be looked into as a substantial question of law Admittedly there is no document of lease or agreement of tenancy between the parties But at the same time there is also no good evidence adduced on the part of the plaintiff respondent showing that the defendant appellant was inducted as a licensee in September Barring the uncorroborated testimony of the plaintiff respondent there is no evidence whatsoever of induction of the defendant appellant as a licensee for a period of four months in the disputed room of the suit premises We find from the admitted evidence of the plaintiff respondent There is no evidence that the parties are related to each other or that they had any previous acquintance We have already seen that it is the specific defence case that his father was there in that house for a long time and that after demise of his father in he was accepted as a tenant at a monthly rental of Rs If we find positive evidence on record that he was there since before that time it would demolish the case of the plaintiff respondent that the defendant was inducted as a licensee only in September and not before All the four witnesses examined by the defendant including the defendant appellant himself were disbelieved and their eidence brushed aside on this sweeping assumption that no such case made out in the written statement though there is such a case in the written statement itself On a careful perusal of the judgment of <ORG> it will appear that he placed no reliance upon the testimony of the witnesses examined by the defendant or the credibility of such witnesses in the context of their making statement that the defendant father was also there in the suit premises and the court below assumed it to be a case not made out in the written statement itself I have gone through the written statement very carefully to find that there is actually such a case in the written statement Both the courts below made this apparent error in not looking properly into the written statement and therefore mis directed themselves in assessing the oral evidence adduced by the parties Coming to the evidence of the witnesses examined by the plaintiff we have already seen that the plaintiff admitted that he did not know the father of the defendant appellant and he could not say if the defendant father was the tenant in the suit premises Thereby exclusive possession of the portion of the suit premises was given to the defendant There is nothing to show that the plaintiff landlord retained legal possession of the same in the sense allowing the defendant tenant to occupy it only as a licensee or an invitee for a period of four months If there is convincing evidence on record to show that really the defendant was living elsewhere then in that case the defendant will have no case as a tenant in the suit premises It is true he was once a tenant in this house but he left it long ago and purchased a house site and built a house in the name of his wife away from this place although he claims that he shifted from this house in We have already seen that as the son of the friend of the plaintiff respondent was requested to bring those rent counterfoils and he admittedly produced the same on such request The defendant has already categorically denied that either he was a tenant in the said premises or that he ever paid rent to the father of the or that the rent counterfoils Exts am at a loss to understand as to how <ORG> could come to the conclusion that the signatures are identical or of the same person But there is overwhelming evidence on record to show that the defendant was living with his family in the suit premises even long before his induction as licensee in
