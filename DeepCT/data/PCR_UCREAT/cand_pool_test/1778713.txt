In this petition she claimed one of two reliefs she set up her sale and asked that the property should be released from attachment in the alternative she asked that even if the sale should be held to be invalid as against the attaching decree holder the execution sale should be directed to be held subject to the mortgage in her favour It appears from the endorsement on Ex The plaintiff accordingly filed this suit for the recovery of the amount due under the mortgage contending that as the sale had failed he was entitled to fall back upon the mortgage The learned Subordinate Judge gave effect to this contention and dismissed the suit The seventh defendant raised other contentions which formed the subject matter of the other issues raised in the case One of them was a plea of partial discharge which forms the subject matter of the fourth issue Finally there was a question of the amount which the plaintiff was entitled to recover in view of the fact that he still retains as vendee two items of the hypotheca It was in those circumstances impossible to imply any adjudication that the claim founded on the mortgage was well founded In the application of this principle of presumed intention it makes no difference whether the third party is allowed to claim in preference to the sale on the ground of his being a subsequent encumbrancer or on the ground of his being an attaching decree holder But if in pursuance of the attachment the properties are brought to sale in execution the vendee is deprived of his rights under the sale to the extent to which the properties are sold in execution and we think that there is no meaning in saying that even to this extent the sale is operative as between the vendor and the vendee by taking a conveyance of the equity of redemption in favour of trustees for the benefit of the prior mortgagee and added that in India it was unnecessary to resort to this conveyancing device and as a rule of equity the principle of presumed intention to keep the mortgage alive might be applied this question had to be considered in respect of the effect of an intermediate attachment as in the present case and their Lordships observed at It is idle to contend that there was any intention to extinguish the old mortgages for the benefit of the execution creditor or any purchaser at the sheriff sale We must accordingly hold that the plaintiffs claim under the suit mortgage has not been extinguished by the subsequent sale and that it is enforceable in the events that have happened This is made clear by the use of the words mortgage referred to by the decree holder instead of words like mortgage admitted by the decree holder It remains to deal with two other questions raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the seventh defendant This relates to a plea of discharge it being the seventh defendant case that in or about April he paid to the plaintiff a sum of Rs Though the learned Sub Judge has not discussed in detail the evidence bearing upon this question he has clearly indicated that he was not impressed by the evidence adduced in support of the plea of discharge We have been taken by Mr <NAME> through the relevant portions of the oral evidence and we see no reason to come to a different conclusion from the plaintiff and did receive it about this time we are not by any means satisfied that there is any connection between that transaction and the alleged payment by the seventh defendant to the plaintiff The second issue raised the question of the accountability of the plaintiff for the profits received by her from the lands which had been purchased by the seventh defendant As we do not propose to decide the question as an abstract question of law in this case we do not think it necessary to refer to the cases in detail In the circumstances of the present case and in view of the fact that a petition has been filed before us on behalf of the seventh defendant for relief under the Agriculturists Relief Act IV of we think it best to hold that no accounting is necessary and it would be more equitable to say that after rd October the plaintiff is not entitled to claim interest as against the seventh defendant to the extent of the proportion of the mortgage debt recoverable from the properties in the seventh defendant possession In this view there is no occasion in our opinion to deal with the petition under Madras Act IV of either As the plaintiff has become the owner of the equity of redemption in some of the items of the mortgage property the mortgage must be held to have been split up and the plaintiff will be entitled to a decree only for a proportionate share of the mortgage debt as against the properties purchased by the seventh defendant The appeal is allowed and the case will be sent back to the lower Court to give effect to the above directions and pass a preliminary decree for sale for the amount ascertained as above
