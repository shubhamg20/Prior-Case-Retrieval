Subsequent to the acquisition of certain lands in the said area in the State of Haryana issued another Notification dated rd November bearing No PH under Section read with Section of the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter referred to as the A Act for construction of a Sewage Treatment Plant In the said Notification it also was made clear that the Land Acquisition Collector cum District Revenue Officer <NAME> Haryana proposed to take possession of the land in question as the land was to be acquired urgently Aggrieved by the decision of <ORG> to acquire the land for construction of the Sewage Treatment Plant <ORG> filed a suit against the State of Haryana to restrain the defendant therein including the State of Haryana from constructing the Sewage Treatment Plant in front of the school and on th February an interim order was passed in the suit restraining the defendants from constructing the said Plant as the same was likely to be a health hazard for the inhabitants of the locality Having been denied the opportunity of filing an objection under Section A of the A Act the appellants also filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the two Notifications under Sections and of the A Act on several grounds Furthermore an earlier Notification issued under Sections and of the A Act in the year had also been challenged in Civil Writ Petition No of before <ORG> wherein an order of status quo was passed on th January In the subsequent writ petition out of which this appeal arises the appellants herein inter alia prayed for quashing of the two Notifications dated rd November and nd January issued under Section read with Clause of Sub Section of Section and Section of the A Act on the ground that the same were arbitrary and contrary to the provisions of the Act A prayer was also made for a writ in the nature of Mandamus to direct the respondents in the writ petition not to dispossess the appellants herein from the land in question Negating the contention of the appellants writ petitioners that they had been wrongly deprived of their right to file an objection to the proposed acquisition of their lands under Section A of the A Act <ORG> came to the conclusion that the provisions of Section read with Section had been religiously observed and followed by the Notification under Section pursuant to which Award was announced on rd May The said right could be dispensed with only after the appropriate Government forms an opinion that along with the existence of urgency under Section or unforeseen emergency under Section there was also a need to dispense with the provisions of Section A He submitted that similar Notifications under Sections and of the A Act had been published in for acquisition of land measuring acres kanals marlas belonging to the appellants and adjoining the lands now sought to be acquired under the Notification dated rd November issued under Section read with Sections and of the aforesaid Act for the selfsame purpose On the other hand by denying the appellants the opportunity of filing objections under Section A of the A Act the respondents had tried to play down the fact that the STP was being constructed next to a school and grain market which would prove to be a health hazard not only for the students of the school but for the inhabitants of the area in general Section confers extraordinary powers on the authorities under which it can dispense with the normal procedure laid down under Section A of the Act in exceptional case of urgency Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the <ORG> to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose A public purpose however laudable it may be by itself is not sufficient to take aid of Section to use this extraordinary power as use of such power deprives a landowner of his right in relation to immovable property to file objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the inquiry under Section A of the Act The authority must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose real urgency that the situation demands and the time factor i whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period within which the objections could be received from the landowners and the inquiry under Section A of the Act could be completed Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose does not arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise unexpectedly exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such as due to earthquake flood or some specific time bound project where the delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous A citizen property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real and genuine urgency it may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due consideration of the acquiring authority While applying the urgency clause the <ORG> should indeed act with due care and responsibility Various other decisions in the same vein were cited by Mr <NAME> which only go to reiterate the propositions laid down in the above mentioned cases It was lastly submitted by Mr <NAME> that in the Written Statement filed on behalf of the respondents herein before <ORG> in the Writ Petition filed by the appellants nothing has been disclosed with regard to urgency which prompted the said respondents to take recourse to the provisions of Section of the A Act On the other hand in paragraph of the said Written Statement it has been sought to be mentioned that if the appellants herein had any grievance with regard to the impugned Notification under Section it was the duty of the appellants to have filed objections It was further stated that having failed to file objections the appellants had waived their right since the respondents had never denied the appellants their right to file objections Appearing for the State of Haryana Mr <NAME> learned Advocate denied the allegations of malafides made on behalf of the appellants and contended that it was in fact the appellants who were guilty of having suppressed the extremely relevant fact that they had filed a Civil Suit in respect of the self same cause of action in <ORG> <ORG> Narwana in which they had prayed for a decree of permanent injunction to restrain the respondents herein from constructing the STP in any direction near the school run by the appellants in the name and style of Chaudhary Devi Lal Memorial Public School Uklana Road Narwana The decision to set up such a STP was the result of accumulation of sewage water which had the ultimate effect of polluting the ground water It was submitted that the interests of a few as represented by the appellants would have to give way to the larger public interest to benefit the entire population of the area It was also submitted by Mr <NAME> that the suit in question had been withdrawn after objections had been taken by the respondents but no liberty had been asked for or taken for commencing a fresh proceeding on the same cause of action Mr <NAME> also questioned the locus standi of the school to file a suit in respect of the land belonging to the appellants In conclusion Mr <NAME> referred to the decision of this Court in <ORG> SCC which dealt with the question of delay in challenging the notice issued under the Land Acquisition Act In the said decision this Court held that long after the Award had been passed in the <ORG> proceedings and compensation had been made over to <ORG> a writ petition challenging the notices issued under Sections and of the <ORG> Act was not maintainable From the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties and the materials on record two points emerge for decision in the instant appeal If an opportunity had been given to file objections to the proposed acquisition the second question would have been resolved while deciding the objections under Section A of the A Act Although it has been urged on behalf of the respondents that the decision to set up the three Sewage Treatment Plants at Narwana was in response to a public demand to install sewage drains and the present site had been chosen to be the most suitable for a STP it has not been denied that the proposed STP is to be situated in the vicinity of a school and grain market which are both hubs of community activities The stand taken by the respondent that the appellants could have filed objections to the proposed acquisition is difficult to appreciate since the right to file such objections had in fact been taken away by invoking the provisions of Section of the A Act Such a stand taken on behalf of the respondent authorities only serve to strengthen the case of the appellants that an opportunity should have been given to them to file objections to the proposed acquisition As indicated hereinabove in the various cases cited by Mr <NAME> and in particular the decision in <NAME> case supra in which reference has been made to the observations made by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra it has been emphasized that a right under Section A is not merely statutory but also has the flavour of fundamental rights under Articles and of the Constitution Such observations had been made in reference to an observation made in the earlier decision in <NAME> case supra and keeping in mind the fact that right to property was no longer a fundamental right an observation was made that even if the right to property was no longer a fundamental right the observations relating to Article would continue to apply in full force with regard to Section A of the A Act The observations made both in <NAME> case supra and in <NAME> case supra assign a great deal of importance to the right of a citizen to file objections under Section A of the A Act when his lands are being taken over under the provisions of the said Act and that they had to satisfy themselves that there was an urgency of such nature as indicated in Section of the Act which could brook no delay whatsoever Since Section A of the A Act had been dispensed with the stage under Section was arrived at within six months from the date of the notice issued under Section and of the A Act It cannot therefore be said that there was either any negligence or lapse or delay on the part of the appellants The only other aspect of the matter which requires consideration is whether the lands in question have already been utilized for the Sewage Treatment Plant From the averments made and photographs which were brought to our notice it appears that the site is still lying unutilized In such circumstances we consider it only proper that the appellants should get an opportunity to file their objections to the proposed acquisition under Section A of the A Act and the respondents would be at liberty to take consequential steps after disposal of the same
