xv Whether company carried on business Therefore whether entitled to deduction of expenses HEADNOTE The assessee company carried on the business of supplying electricity to various cities under licences from the Government In its assessment to income tax for the years and the company claimed deduction of various amounts under xv of the Income tax Act on the basis that it had been carrying on business in the accounting years concerned and the expenses had been incurred solely for the purpose of that business ii On the facts of the case the <ORG> had rightly come to the conclusion that the company had not ceased to carry on its business It was agreed that the <ORG> would pay to the Government half of the net profits of the Lahore electric supply undertaking arising between November and September In its assessment to income tax for the years and the <ORG> claimed deduction of various amounts under xv of the Income tax Act on the basis that it had been carrying on business in the accounting years concerned and the expenses had been incurred solely for the purpose of that business The appellant Commissioner thereafter on August obtained an order from <ORG> of Punjab directing the <ORG> to refer the following two questions to <ORG> for its opinion The only point therefore that arises for decision in this appeal is whether on the facts found it could be said that the Company had been carrying on business in the two accounting years The facts on which they relied were the Company did not sell its undertaking as a going concern it continued in possession of all assets of its undertakings other than those appertaining to the Lahore electric supply undertaking it continued to hold deposits made by consumers of electricity supplied by the Lahore electric supply undertaking which had to be returned to them with interest it had no intention of going into liquidation the Directors report showed that the Directors were considering if they could possibly purchase some manufacturing concern which might become an additional source of profit to the shareholders and there was nothing to show that there was permanent discontinuance of the business of the Company So far as <ORG> is concerned it appears to have held that the Company was carrying on business because there was nothing to show that it intended to go into liquidation and because by keeping its staff and establishment it indicated that it would resume business for otherwise it would not have retained them There is neither authority nor principle to support such a proposition There was further no question of the <ORG> going into liquidation in the accounting years The facts that the Company had to pay the <ORG> half share of the profits between November and September and that it had to return the consumers the deposits made by them would not indicate that it was carrying on a business It would be laying down strange law to hold that where a business has in fact ceased to be run it must be deemed as continuing because the outstanding liabilities of that business had not been liquidated The question whether the Company was carrying on business arises only because if it was it would be entitled under to deductions from its business income in regard to certain expenses incurred by it for the purpose of that business Payment of outstanding liabilities is not an activity which can ever produce such a result Some reliance was placed in this connection on an observation of Lord <NAME> in The Commissioners of Inland Revenue <ORG> In our opinion it must therefore be held that the Company had ceased to carry on business and we would answer the first question in the negative The appeals must be allowed with costs here and below and we order accordingly <NAME> These appeals by special leave raise the question whether the respondent Company was carrying on business during the according years and corresponding to the assessment years and and therefore entitled to deduction of expenses for carrying on the business under xv of the Indian Income tax Act <ORG> took steps for the acquisition of the undertaking relating to Lahore license under the Defence of India Act and Rules and there were disputes and litigations between it and the company It is common case that until September the company was carrying on the business During this period the company was not generating or supplying electricity at Lahore or at any other place and it carried on its activities with a reduced staff For the assessment years and the company claimed deduction of expenses for carrying on its business during the accounting years and under xv of the Indian Income tax Act The Income tax Officer held that the company was not carrying on any business and totally disallowed contribution to employees provident fund pension and gratuity to old staff valuer remuneration legal expenses depreciation and income tax provision but he allowed a part of the salary paid to certain employees rent office expenses interest auditor and directors fees On further appeal by the company <ORG> recorded the following finding Keeping in mind the entire facts and circumstances of this case we have come to the clear conclusion that the assessee Company had not ceased to carry on its business Counsel for the appellant conceded that if the first question is answered in the affirmative the second question must also be answered in the affirmative exchange or otherwise dispose of deal with them from time to time A company may of course own shares and make investments and still not carry on any business but in this case there is nothing to show that its investments are not to be regarded as part of its business activities The company main business may be quiescent but nevertheless it may still carry on business But looking at the other facts and circumstances of the case and the relevant authorities on the point the <ORG> came to the clear conclusion that the company had not ceased to carry on its business There is enough material on the record to support this finding There is no set formula for determining whether in a given case a company is carrying on business From the shareholders and the directors point of view the company was undoubtedly carrying on business during the relevant accounting periods Again if the question arose whether the company was carrying on business during these years for the purpose of of the Code of Civil Procedure I have no doubt in my mind that the answer would be in the affirmative From whatever point of view the matter is looked at the conclusion is irresistible that the company was carrying on business during the relevant accounting years There is ample material on which the <ORG> could come to this finding and I see no reason for disturbing its finding In the result the appeals are dismissed with costs ORDER In accordance with the majority Judgments the Appeals are allowed with costs here and below
