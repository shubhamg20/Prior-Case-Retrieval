The suit was for a permanent injunction restraining the Union Territory of Pondicherry from taking possession of the property in pursuance of the acquisition proceedings She filed the suit on The Court below found that the appellant who could have filed the suit even before the Code of Civil Procedure was extended to the Union Territory of Pondicherry as the Notification under Section of the Land Acquisition Act was made on sic and who had filed the suit only under Order VII Rule of the Civil Procedure Code was bound to issue the notice as required by Section of the Code This writ petition has come before us as in the opinion of <NAME> it involves a question of considerable constitutional importance The Government of the <ORG> Territory of Pondicherry made the declaration under Section of the Land Acquisition Act on to the effect that the land was required for a public purpose being a purpose of the <ORG> to wit <NAME> alias <NAME> as one of the owners of the land sought to be acquired filed I of under Article of the Constitution against the Union Territory of Pondicherry for the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the declaration dated made under Section of the Land Acquisition Act on the main ground that after the publication of the notice under Section of that Act he filed his objections and that the declaration under Section of the Act has been made without holding any enquiry under Section A of the Act <NAME> found that an enquiry under Section A had been actually held after service of notice on the petitioner <NAME> therein and that he had in fact filed a statement in that enquiry In four civil miscellaneous petitions of two of them filed by the Union Territory of Pondicherry and two by <NAME> and <NAME> one of the proprietors of the hotel the petitioner herein this Court ordered that the status quo should be maintained until final orders were passed by <ORG> at Pondicherry in certain review petitions and connected petitions which were then pending before that Court The allegations made in <NAME> affidavit filed in support of the writ petition are briefly these <NAME> put up some additional constructions after the one room tenement and appurtenant land were taken on lease from <NAME> The learned Judges who dismissed that appeal on have observed that it was open to <NAME> to pursue her remedy under the common law Pondicherry for a permanent injunction restraining the first respondent the Union Territory of Pondicherry from taking possession of the property In that suit she filed I A No of for an interim injunction restraining the first respondent from taking possession of the hotel premises Though the petitioner is vitally interested in a portion of the property under acquisition no notice of the enquiry under Section A of the Land Acquisition Act was given to him before the declaration under Section of the said Act was made Sections and of the Land Acquisition Act do not provide for the payment of any compensation against the destruction of this property which would result from the acquisition No reason need be given for such a decision and no right of appeal is provided against that decision and the entire property of a citizen can be taken away in the most high handed fashion There is no procedure for the circulation of <ORG> throughout the State and it is troublesome to obtain copies thereof from the <ORG> Press There is no provision for serving copy of the declaration under Section of the Land Acquisition Act on the owner or occupier of the land The entire proceeding under Section A is a secret one in so far as no copy of the decision under that section is given to the party before it is submitted to the <ORG> It is apparent that the Lieutenant Governor of Pondicherry who has formed the opinion that the land should be acquired was not even aware that there was a building with a running business on the land The delegation is violative of the Constitution of India and the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act in so far as Article does not authorize <ORG> to entrust its powers and functions in relation to matters other than the administration of the Union Territory of Pondicherry on the Administrator of that territory and the power to administer that territory does not include the power to acquire land for the purpose of <ORG> even if the land to be acquired is situate in that territory His joint petition dated was rejected by the Land Acquisition Officer and he was informed that his request could not be acceded to He had knowledge of the affixture of the notification under Section of the Act on the land on <NAME> suit of filed for a permanent injunction restraining the <ORG> from taking possession of the acquired property and for other reliefs has been dismissed by the Additional District Judge Pondicherry The power of the <ORG> to acquire land for public purposes is irrespective of the proprietary right or interest of the owner of the land and persons holding under him and they have only the right to compensation for the property acquired Section of the Act provides that if the person interested is compelled in consequence of the acquisition of the land to change his residence or place of business the <ORG> may take into consideration the reasonable expenses if any incidental thereto Nothing prevented the petitioner from carrying on his business in another suitable place and as a matter of fact he has not taken advantage of the alternative accommodation which was offered to be provided for him Section of the Land Acquisition Act provides that the <ORG> shall not take into consideration any damages sustained by the person interested which if caused by a private individual could not render such person liable to suit If the owner could evict him on the ground of his requirement he would have no right except to remove his superstructure within the scope of the authority given to him for administering that territory could be entrusted with other executive functions viz The petitioner is trying to cover once again the ground covered by the writ petitions mentioned above and he is not entitled to any relief He has not suppressed any material fact and there is no wanton delay in filing the petition He was served with notice of the enquiry under Section but not of the enquiry under Section A of the Land Acquisition Act There is no question of res judicata The petitioner has mentioned five grounds in the affidavit filed in support of the petition for the issue of a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ direction or order directing the respondents the Union Territory of Pondicherry end <ORG> to release from the acquisition the land and the building acquired in pursuance of the notification dated which was published on under Section of the Land Acquisition Act The first ground is that the petitioner right to carry on hotel business in pursuance of the licence granted by the <ORG> of Pondicherry and the authorities of <ORG> of that Union Territory and the goodwill which he has earned are all property Sections and of the Land Acquisition Act do not provide for payment of any compensation for the destruction of this property which would result from the acquisition The second ground is that the decision whether a land should be acquired or not is left to the subjective satisfaction of the appropriate <ORG> and no reason need be given for such a decision and no right of appeal is provided against that decision and the entire property of a citizen can be taken away in a most high handed fashion There is no procedure for circulating the gazette throughout the State and it is troublesome to obtain copies from the <ORG> Press There is no provision for serving any copy of the declaration under Section of the Land Acquisition Act on the owner of or the occupier of the land The entire procedure under Section A is a secret one in so far as no copy of the decision under that Section is given to the party before it is submitted to the <ORG> Governor of Pondicherry who formed the opinion that the land should be acquired was not even aware of the fact that there was a building with a running business on the land The delegation is violative of the Constitution of India and the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act in so far as Article does not authorise the <ORG> of India to entrust its functions in relation to matters other than the administration of the Union Territory of Pondicherry on the administrator of that territory and the power to administer that territory does not include the power to acquire land for the purpose of <ORG> even if the land is situate in that territory We are of the opinion that there is no substance in the first four grounds urged by the petitioner The second is the damage sustained by the person interested by reason of the taking of any standing crops or trees which may be on the land at the time of the Collector taking possession thereof The third is the damages if any sustained by the person interested at the time of the Collector taking possession of the land by reason of severing such land from his other land The sixth and the last is the damages if any bona fide resulting from diminution of the profits of the land between the time of the publication of the declaration under Section and the time of the Collector taking possession of the land Therefore under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act it is not open to the petitioner to raise any objection to the acquisition on the ground that it affects his right to carry on his trade or business on the particular land acquired for the public purpose The question whether a particular land should or should not be acquired for a public purpose is left under Section of the Land Acquisition Act to the decision of the appropriate <ORG> which when it is so satisfied may make a declaration to that effect in <ORG> Sections A and do not require service of the notification under Section and any notice personally for holding an enquiry under Section A and the making of declaration that the particular land is needed for a public purpose on the parties interested in the land Section A lays down that any person interested in any land which has been notified under Section Sub section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose may within thirty days after the issue of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be If the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report made under Section A that any particular land is needed for a public purpose a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of the Secretary to such <ORG> or of some officer duly authorised to certify the orders Sub section of Section provides for service of that notice on the occupier if any of such land and on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein or to be entitled to act for persons so interested as reside or have agents authorised to receive service on their behalf within the concerned revenue district The petitioner has admitted in his reply affidavit that the notice contemplated under Section of the Act has been served on him The fact that the notification is said to have described the property sought to be acquired as only a building site while as a matter of fact there were buildings on the land and compensation has been awarded for the same would not in our opinion affect the acquisition proceedings as land would include any building standing thereon The petitioner has not been deprived of his right to carry on his business by the acquisition in this case Therefore there is no substance in the objection of the petitioner that any right has been affected by the acquisition The learned Counsel for the petitioner perhaps thought that there is no substance in the first four grounds urged by the petitioner in the affidavit Section of the Act says that whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose a notification to that effect shall be published in the Official Gazette and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality Posts and Telegraphs telephones wireless broadcasting and other like forms of communication constitute Item of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution Article of the Constitution lays down that notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule The respondents have admitted in their counter affidavit that the appropriate Government in the instant case would be <ORG> Therefore as contended by the petitioner the subjective satisfaction that the land in this case is needed for the public purpose should be of <ORG> and then alone under Section of the Land Acquisition Act the notification to that effect has to be published in the Official Gazette The respondents contend that the functions to be exercised by <ORG> under the Land Acquisition Act are executive in nature and could be delegated to any appropriate agency and that the Administrator of the Union Territory of Pondicherry within the scope of the authority given to him for administering that territory could be entrusted with other executive functions namely land acquisition by notification Competent authority according to Section of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act means any person or authority authorised by <ORG> by notification in the Official Gazette to perform the functions of the competent authority under this Act for such area as may be specified in the notification Section of that Act reads Where any property is subject to requisition <ORG> may if it is of opinion that it is necessary to acquire the property for a public purpose at any time acquire such property by publishing in <ORG> a notice to the effect that <ORG> has decided to acquire the property in pursuance of this section Provided that before issuing such notice <ORG> shall call upon the owner of or any other person who in the opinion of <ORG> may be interested in such property to show cause why the property should not be acquired and after considering the cause if any shown by any person interested in the property and after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard <ORG> may pass such orders as it deems fit Save as otherwise provided by <ORG> by law every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting to such extent as he thinks fit through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify Clause of that Article lays down that any such law as is referred to in Clause shall not be deemed to be an amendment to this Constitution for the purposes of Article notwithstanding that it contains any provision which amends or has the effect of amending the Constitution That contention has been repelled by <ORG> for two reasons in these words There are two reasons why on the face of it the submission has to be rejected as untenable Article no doubt lays down that all elected members of <ORG> are to be included in <ORG> but the word States used in this Article cannot include Union Territories when the Constitution came into force subject only to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under Article The second reason why it must be held that members of <ORG>s of Union Territories cannot form part of the electoral college under Article is that Article confines the electoral college to members of <ORG> and there are no Legislative Assemblies in the Union Territories The Article further lays down that where there are two <ORG>s of <ORG> one is to be known as <ORG> and the other as <ORG> and where there is only one <ORG> it is to be known as <ORG> In the case of Union Territories the provision for <ORG>s is contained in Article A but that Article does not mention that any <ORG> of the <ORG> created for any of the Union Territories will be known as <ORG> Thus it is clear that the President while administering the Union Territory of Pondicherry by virtue of the powers conferred under Article does not act as the head of <ORG> What could be delegated by the President under Article of the Constitution to an Administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify is the power to administer any Union Territory as Clause of that Article says Save as otherwise provided by <ORG> by law every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting to such extent as he thinks fit through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify If there is nothing to show whether the property is let by the year by the month or by the day If a tenant who has a written lease continues to have the enjoyment of the property after the expiration thereof without the lessor raising any objection he will be held to occupy it on the same terms and for the term fixed by the customs of the place and can no longer quit or be ejected except after the notice required by the custom of the place has been given The lease if made in writing comes to an end ipso facto at the end of the period fixed without it being necessary to give notice to quit The records show that in a civil miscellaneous petition filed in by the petitioner this court ordered that the status quo shall be maintained until final orders were passed by the vacation court at Pondicherry in certain revision and connected petitions which were then pending before that court The records further show that possession of the portion of the superstructure in which the petitioner was interested was admittedly taken on with the help of the police to the knowledge of the petitioner brother <NAME> who was in charge of Raja Gana Pathi Refreshment Stall at that time Before this was done it is seen from the records that the petitioner had been served on with a notice by registered post directing him to vacate and deliver possession of the building occupied by him before the evening of It is also seen from the records that the petitioner and the other tenants <NAME> and <NAME> had submitted a petition dated to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communication The owner of the land <NAME> filed No of for quashing the declaration dated made under Section of the Land Acquisition Act She accordingly filed No of in the court of the First Additional District Judge Pondicherry for a permanent injunction restraining the first respondent from taking possession of the property The petitioner had not taken any steps till then and the order passed in No of on against the owner of the property the petitioner lessor has become final The question as to when a right to sue arises depends mostly on the facts and circumstances of each case AIR PC There can be no right to sue until there is an accrual of the right asserted in the suit and its infringement or at least a clear and unequivocal threat to infringe that right by the defendant against whom the suit is instituted Reference is made to this decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> where it is observed at page The legal position may be briefly stated thus The right to sue under Article of the Limitation Act accrues when the defendant has clearly and unequivocally threatened to infringe the right asserted by the plaintiff in the suit The notification under Section of the Act had been made on and further steps were being taken thereafter and it cannot be stated that the petitioner was not under any impression that there was no effective threat to the right claimed by him by the acquisition proceedings <NAME> had not given the notice required by Section of the Code of Civil Procedure before she filed No of on in <ORG> Pondicherry for a permanent injunction restraining the Union Territory of Pondicherry from taking possession of the property acquired on the ground that she had a charge on the property for the mahar debt due to her Section of the Pondicherry Extension of Laws Act which received the assent of the President on and was published on that date says that the Acts specified in Part I of the schedule as they are generally in force in the territories to which they extend and the Acts specified in Part II of the schedules as they were in force on the st day of August in the State or Union Territory mentioned there against shall extend to Pondicherry subject to the modifications if any specified in the schedule The learned Counsel for the appellant would however contend that the appellant need not give the notice required by Section of that Code having regard to Clause of Sub section of Section of the Pondicherry Extension of Laws Act Any law in force in Pondicherry or any area thereof corresponding to any Act referred to in Sub section of Section or any part thereof except in so far as such law continues to be applicable to Renoncants shall stand repealed as from the coming into force of such Act in Pondicherry Nothing in Sub section I shall affect a the previous operation of any law so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder or any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under any law so repealed or any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any law so repealed or any investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right privilege obligation liability penalty forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid and any such investigation legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued or enforced and any such penalty forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if this Act had not been passed Provided that anything done pr any action taken including any appointment or delegation made notification instruction or direction issued form bye law or scheme framed certificate obtained permit or licence granted or registration effected under any such law shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provision of the Act extended to Pondicherry by this Act and shall continue to be in force accordingly unless and until superseded by anything done or any action taken under the said Act We do not agree with the learned Counsel for the appellant that by reason of Clause of Sub section of Section of the Pondicherry Extension of Laws Act and the proviso it was open to the appellant to file the suit without issuing the notice required by Section of the Code of Civil Procedure notwithstanding the feet that that Code as it was in force in the State of Madras on the first day of August has been made applicable to Pondicherry with effect from It cannot be stated that it was open to a party who filed his suit or proceeding after to continue to pay the stamp duty and court fees which were payable on documents and in respect of suits and other proceedings in Pondicherry prior to ignoring the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act and the <ORG> Fees Act which have been made applicable to Pondicherry having regard to Section and the proviso Sub section says that any law in force in Pondicherry or any area thereof corresponding to any Act referred to in Sub section of Section or any part thereof except in so far as such law continues to be applicable to Renoncants shall stand repealed as from the coming into force of such Act in Pondicherry If this is done it will be clear that the appellant would be bound by the provisions of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which is a procedural matter after As a matter of fact she had filed the suit only under Order VII of the Code of Civil Procedure Therefore it is not open for her to contend that she was not bound to issue the notice required by Section of the same Code before instituting the suit The appeal is dismissed with costs
