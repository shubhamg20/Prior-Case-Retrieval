Thereupon the appellant made a representation but on I The single judge who heard the matter held that the order was invalid as the provisions of Art of the Constitution and the appellant was entitled to a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the order of the Constitution which makes no distinction between persons holding permanent or temporary posts in the matter of their tenure being dependent on the pleasure of the President or the Governor Art One test for determining whether the termination of service was by way of punishment or otherwise is to ascertain whether under the Service Rules but for such termination the servant has the right to hold the post Conversely where no such right can exist as in the case of a probationary or officiating appointment to a permanent or temporary post or where the service has not ripened into a quasi permanent status and under the general law the service can be terminated on reasonable notice the termination of service cannot amount to a punishment and attract the Article So where the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the Rules the right to terminate the service at any time such termination in the manner provided in the contract or under the Rules cannot attract the provisions of Art That does not however mean that the termination of service of a servant who has no right to the post can never be a dismissal or removal by way of punishment A reduction in rank must similarly be a punishment if it carries penal consequences with it and the two tests to be applied are whether the servant has a right to the post or the rank or whether evil consequences such as forfeiture of pay or allowances loss of seniority in his substantive rank stoppage or postponement of future chances of promotion follow as a result of the order In the instant case the appellant was holding an officiating post and had no right under the rules of the Railway Code to continue in it The order of the General Manager visited him with no evil consequences Consequently he was not reduced in rank by way of punishment applies to all classes of <ORG> Servants whether permanent quasipermanent officiating temporary or on probation and that the words dismissal removal and reduction in rank used therein have a special meaning that Article properly construed cannot be confined to the penalties prescribed by the Service Rules Though the conditions of service prescribed by the Rules can be varied unilaterally in some cases because of the pleasure of the President they cannot be ignored as long as they stand and if they are infringed while in force Art In the present case the General Manager remarks in the confidential file which formed a part of the operative order and was its real foundation clearly indicated the mischief that the appellant was not to be promoted to a like post until in the opinion of some competent Officer he had made good his previous short comings Appeal from the judgment and order dated January of <ORG> Circuit Bench at Delhi in Letters Patent Appeal No of arising out of the judgment and order dated April of the Single Judge of the Circuit Bench of <ORG> in Civil Writ No of It is directed against the judgment and order passed by a Division Bench of that court on January in Letters Patent Appeal No of reversing the judgment and order of Mr Justice <NAME> pronounced on April whereby his Lordship had allowed the appellant application being Civil Writ No of and set aside the order passed by the General Manager <ORG> on August reverting the petitioner from the post of Signal and Tele communication Engineer <ORG> in Class II service where the appellant was officiating to his substantive post in Class III service This appeal raises a very important question about the construction of art I am disappointed to read these reports On July the appellant who had by this time earned two increments on July and July made a representation against the remarks made against him He should also be informed that he has in his representation used language unbecoming of a senior official and that he should desist from this in future <NAME> In the meantime the petitioner had on February filed his writ petition under Art Mr Justice <NAME> took the view that the petitioner had been punished by being reduced in rank without being given an opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him and that consequently the order was invalid for non compliance with the provisions of Art Under the English Common Law all servants of the <ORG> held office during the pleasure of the <ORG> and were liable to be dismissed at any time and without any reason being assigned for such dismissal No action lay against the <ORG> in respect of such dismissal even though it were contrary to the express term of the contract of employment for the theory was that the <ORG> could not fetter its future executive action by entering into a contract in matters which concerned the welfare of the <ORG> Ch as originally enacted there was no reference to this doctrine of the English Common Law Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder every person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed and the Secretary of <ORG> in Council may except so far as he may provide by rules to the contrary re instate any person in that service who has been dismissed Sub section of that section empowered the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to make rules for regulating the classification of the Civil Services in India the method of recruitment the conditions of service pay and allowances and discipline and conduct and sub section declared that all service rules then in force had been duly made and confirmed the same Law rule that the servants of the Crown held their Offices during the pleasure of the Crown and at the same time imposed one important qualification upon the exercise of the Crown pleasure namely that a servant might not be dismissed by an authority sub ordinate to that by which he had been appointed The relevant portions of of the Act are set out below Except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of a Civil service of the <ORG> in India or holds any civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed from the service of His Majesty by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Then followed a proviso which made sub inapplicable to certain persons and then came sub providing for compensation for premature termination of employment in certain cases which it is not necessary to set out here It should be noted that the opening words of namely Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder were substituted by the words Except as expressly provided by this Act Subsection reproduced the qualification which had been imposed by namely that a servant of the class therein mentioned must not be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he had been appointed and sub introduced a still more important qualification on the exercise of the <ORG> pleasure namely that no such servant must be dismissed or reduced in rank until he had been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Chapter I contains seven sections grouped under the heading Services omitting the proviso to cl are as follows Except as expressly provided by this Constitution every person who is a member of a defence service or of a civil service of the <ORG> or of an all India Service or holds any post connected with defence or any civil post under the <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> No person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> or an all India service or a civil service of a <ORG> or holds a civil post under the <ORG> or a St ate shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him povided If any question arises whether it is reasonably practicable to give any person an opportunity of showing cause under clause the decision thereon of the authority empowered to dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank as the case may be shall be final To summarise As under of the Act and of the Act the persons specified therein held office during the pleasure of the <ORG> so under Art they hold their office during the pleasure of the President or of the Governor as the case may be and which respectively provide expressly that the <ORG> Judges the Auditor General the <ORG> Judges and the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of <ORG> supported by the requisite majority therein specified has been presented to him in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity that public servants hold their office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be has adopted the English Common Law rule that public servants hold office during the pleasure of the President or Governor as the case may be and has by Art Though the two qualifications are set out in a separate article they quite clearly restrict the operation of the rule embodied in Art we find that it gives a two fold protection to persons who come within the article namely against dismissal or removal by an authority subordinate to that by which they were appointed and against dismissal or removal or reduction in rank without giving them a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them In the absence of a contract to the contrary the terms of employment of persons in different services are governed by rules made by the appropriate authorities to which reference will hereafter be made Such an employment on probation under the ordinary law of master and servant comes to an end if during or at the end of the probation the servant so appointed on trial is found unsuitable and his service is terminated by a notice An appointment to officiate in a permanent post is usually made when the incumbent substantively holding that post is on leave or when the permanent post is vacant and no substantive appointment has yet been made to that post Such an officiating appointment comes to an end on the return of the incumbent substantively holding the post from leave in the former case or on a substantive appointment being made to that permanent post in the latter case or on the service of a notice of termination as agreed upon or as may be reasonable under the ordinary law In short in the case of an appointment to a permanent post in a <ORG> service on probation or on an officiating basis the servant so appointed does not acquire any substantive right to the post and consequently cannot complain any more than a private servant employed on proba tion or on an officiating basis can do if his service is terminated at any time Here also in the absence of any special stipulation or any specific service rule the servant so appointed acquires no fight to the post and his service can be terminated at any time except in one case namely when the appointment to a temporary post is for a definite period In such a case the servant so appointed acquires a right to his tenure for that period which cannot be put an end to unless there is a special contract entitling the employer to do so on giving the requisite notice or the person so appointed is on enquiry held on due notice to the servant and after giving him a reasonable opportunity to defend himself found guilty of misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other disqualification and is by way of punishment dismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank The position may therefore be summarised as follows In the absence of any special contract the substantive appointment to a permanent post gives the servant so appointed a right to hold the post until under the rules he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired after having put in the prescribed number of years service or the post is abolished and his service cannot be terminated except by way Of punishment for misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other disqualification found against him on proper enquiry after due notice to him An appointment to a temporary post for a certain specified period also gives the servant so appointed a right to hold the post for the entire period of his tenure and his tenure cannot be put an end to during that period unless he is by way of punishment dismissed or removed from the service A number of decisions bearing on the question of construction of Arts and have been cited before us which indicate that there is some difference of opinion between the Judges of the different <ORG> and in some cases amongst the Judges of the same <ORG> Thus it has been held in some cases that Arts On the other hand it has been held in some cases that a <ORG> servant cannot be deemed to be a member of a service unless he is permanently absorbed therein nor can he be deemed to be a holder of such post unless he holds it permanently and that such a <ORG> servant is not entitled to claim the benefit of Art but that a termination of service brought about otherwise than by way of punishment by the exercise of the right under the terms of employment or under the relevant rules regulating the conditions of service which form part of the terms of employment does not or is brought about by the exercise of the right to terminate it arising out of the terms of employment agreed upon between the parties or contained in rules regulating the conditions of service subject to which the employment was made Article does not in terms say that the protections of that article extend only to persons who are permanent members of the services or who hold permanent civil posts refers to such person as aforesaid and this reference takes us back to cl of that article which speaks of a person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> or an all India service or a civil service of a <ORG> or holds a civil post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> which besides them also includes persons who are members of a defence service or who hold any post connected with defence Article also is not in terms confined to persons who are permanent members of the specified services or who hold permanent posts connected with the services therein mentioned To hold that that article covers only those persons who are permanent members of the specified services or who hold posts connected with the services therein mentioned will be to say that persons who are not permanent members of those services or who do not hold permanent posts therein do not hold their respective offices during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be a proposition which obviously cannot stand scrutiny it is obvious that if that article is limited to persons who are permanent members of the services or who hold permanent civil posts then the constitutional protection given by cls and will not extend to persons who officiate in a permanent post or in a temporary post and consequently such persons will be liable to be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which they were appointed or be liable to be dismissed removed or reduced in rank without being given any opportunity to defend themselves The latter classes of servants require the constitutional protections as much as the other classes do and there is nothing in the language of Art There is no apparent reason for such distinction It is said that persons who are merely officiating in the posts cannot be said to hold the post for they only perform the duties of those posts The word hold is also used in Arts There is no reason to think that our Constitution makers intended that the disqualification referred to in cl of the former and cl of the latter should extend only to persons who substantively held permanent posts and not to those who held temporary posts and that persons officiating in permanent or temporary posts would be eligible for election as President or Vice President of India in terms makes no distinction between permanent and temporary members of the services or between persons holding permanent or temporary posts in the matter of their tenure being dependent upon the pleasure of the President or the Governor so does Art Clause protects Government servant against being dismissed or removed or reduced in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them This leads us to embark upon an examination of the service rules relating to punishments to which the Government servants can be subjected Rule of the Civil Service Regulations of hereinafter called the Rules provide inter alia that the removal of public servants from the service for misconduct insolvency inefficiency not due to age or failure to pass a prescribed examination entailed forfeiture of past services In exercise of the powers conferred by of he Act the Secretary of <ORG> in Council framed the Civil Service Governor Provinces Classification Rules hereinafter referred to as the Classification Rules which came into force in December and were applicable to <ORG> servants serving in the Governor Provinces Likewise XIII provided that without prejudice to the provisions of any law for the time being in force the local <ORG> might for good and sufficient reasons censure withhold promotion from reduce to a lower post suspend remove or dismiss any officer holding a post in a provincial or subordinate service or a special appointment Rule XIV laid down the procedure in cases of dismissal removal or reduction in the following terms Rule XIV Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act in all cases in which the dismissal removal or reduction of any officer is ordered the order shall except when it is based on facts or conclusions established at a judicial trial or when the officer concerned has absconded with the accusation hanging over him be preceded by a properly recorded departmental enquiry At such an enquiry a definite charge in writing shall be framed in respect of each offence and explained to the accused the evidence in support of it and any evidence which he may adduce in his defence shall be recorded in his presence and his defence shall be taken down in writing Rule as originally framed provided as follows The following penalties may for good and sufficient reason and as hereinafter provided be imposed upon members of the services comprised in any of the class to specified in rule namely i Censure ii Withholding of increments or promotion including stoppage at an efficiency bar iii Reduction to a lower post or time scale or to a lower stage in a time scale iv Recovery from pay of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to Government by negligence or breach of orders Suspension vi Removal from the civil service of the Crown which does not disqualify from future employment vii Dismissal from <ORG> which ordinarily disqualifies from future employment Explanation The discharge a of a person appointed on probation during the period of probation of a person appointed otherwise than under contract to hold a temporary appointment on the expiration of the period of the appointment of a person engaged under contract in accordance with the terms of his contract does not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule So amended the Explanations read as follows Explanation I The termination of employment a of a person appointed on probation during or at the end of the period of probation in accordance with the terms of the appointment and the rules governing the probationary service or of a temporary Government servant appointed otherwise than under contract in accordance with rule of the Central Civil Services Temporary Service Rules or of a person engaged under a contract does not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule or of rule Like XIV of the Classification Rules of the Classification Rules as originally framed in provided that without prejudice to the Public Servants Enquiries Act no order of dismissal removal or reduction should be passed on a member of a service other than an order passed on facts which had led to his conviction in a criminal court or by a court martial unless he had been informed in writing of the grounds on which it was proposed to take action and had been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself Detailed provisions were made as to the grounds on which it was proposed to take action being reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges and for the communication thereof to the officer together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge was based and further provisions were made as to the procedure relating to the filing of the defence the right to cross examine and to give evidence in person or to have such witnesses called as he might wish to examine in his defence There is a Note below this rule to the effect that the discharge a of a person appointed on probation during the period of probation of a person engaged under contract for a specific period on the expiration of such period in accordance with the terms of his contract of a person appointed in a temporary capacity otherwise than under a contract in accordance with the general conditions of service applicable to temporary employment and of some other persons enumerated therein do not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of Rule specifies the authority competent to impose penalties In exercise of the powers conferred by sub of of the Act the Governor General made certain rules called the Central Civil Service Temporary Service Rules hereinafter referred to as the Temporary Service Rules These rules applied to all persons who held a civil post under <ORG> and who were under the rulemaking control of the Governor General but who did not hold a lien on any post under <ORG> or any Provincial Government but they did not apply to several categories of persons including the railway servants By those rules some protection had been given even to persons who did not substantively hold permanent posts Further protection was given by the two provisos to that rule In short the service rules out of the several categories of punishments selected the three graver punishments of dismissal removal and reduction in rank and laid down special procedure for giving protection to the <ORG> servants against the infliction of those three major punishments The position of the Government servant was therefore rather insecure for his office being held during the pleasure of His Majesty under the Act as well as under the Act the rules could not over ride or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself The position however improved to some extent under the Act which by gave a further protection in addition to that provided in which reproduced the protection of of the Act It follows from the above discussion that both at the date of the commencement of the Act and of our Constitution the words dismissed removed and reduced in rank as used in the service rules were well understood as signifying or denoting the three major punishments which could be inflicted on Government servants The protection given by the rules to the Government servants against dismissal removal or reduction in rank which could not be en These protections have now been incorporated in Art able opportunity to defend himself which give protection to the Government servants The net result is that it is only in those cases where the Government intends to inflict those three forms of punishments that the Government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him The foregoing conclusion however does not solve the entire problem for it has yet to be ascertained as to when an order for the termination of service is inflicted as and by way of punishment and when it is not It has already been said that where a person is appointed substantively to a permanent post in I Government service he normally acquires a right to hold the post until under the rules he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired and in the absence of a contract express or implied or a service rule he cannot be turned out of his post unless the post itself is abolished or unless he is guilty of misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualifications and appropriate proceedings are taken under the service rules read with Art Again where a person is appointed to a temporary post for a fixed term of say five years his service cannot in the absence of a contract or a service rule permitting its premature termination be terminated before the expiry of that period unless he has been guilty of some misconduct negligence in Further take the case of a person who having been appointed temporarily to a post has been in continuous service for more than three years or has been certified by the appoint ing authority as fit for employment in a quasipermanent capacity such person under of the Temporary Service Rules is to be deemed to be in quasi permanent service which under of those Rules can be terminated i in the circumstances and in the manner in which the employment of a <ORG> servant in a permanent service can be terminated or ii when the appointing authority certifies that a reduction has occurred in the number of posts available for <ORG> servants not in permanent service Except in the three cases just mentioned a <ORG> servant has no right to his post and the termination of service of a <ORG> servant does not except in those cases amount to a dismissal or removal by way of punishment Thus where a person is appointed to a permanent post in a <ORG> service on probation the termination of his service during or at the end of the period of probation will not ordinarily and by itself be a punishment for the <ORG> servant so appointed has no right to continue to hold such a post any more than the servant employed on probation by a private employer is entitled to do Such a termination does not operate as a forfeiture of any right of the servant to hold the post for he has no such right and obviously cannot be a dismissal removal or reduction in rank by way of punishment Likewise if the servant is appointed to officiate in a permanent post or to hold a temporary post other than one for a fixed term whether substantively or on probation or on an officiating basis under the general law the implied term of his employment is that his service may be terminated on reasonable notice and the termination of the service of such a servant will not per se amount to dismissal or removal from service Shortly put the principle is that when a servant has right to a post or to a rank either under the terms of the contract of employment express or implied or under the rules governing the conditions of his service the termination of the service of such a servant or his reduction to a lower post is by itself and prima facie a punishment for it operates as a forfeiture of his right to hold that post or that rank and to get the emoluments and other benefits attached thereto But if the servant has no right to the post as where be is appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an officiating basis and whose temporary service has not ripened into a quasi permanent service as defined in the Temporary Service Rules the termination of his employment does not deprive him of any right and cannot therefore by itself be a punishment One test for determining whether the termination of the service of a <ORG> servant is by way of punishment is to ascertain whether the servant but for such termination had the right to hold the post If he had a right to the post as in the three cases hereinbefore mentioned the termination of his service will by itself be a punishment and he will be entitled to the protection of Art To put it in another way if the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to terminate the employment at any time then such termination in the manner provided by the contract or the rules is prima facie and per se not a punishment and does not attract the provisions of Art It does not however follow that except in the three cases mentioned above in all other cases termination of service of a Government servant who has no right to his post where he was appointed to a post temporary or permanent either on probation or on an officiating basis and had not acquired a quasi In both cases the <ORG> may proceed to take action against the servant in exercise of its powers under the terms of the contract of employment express or implied or under the rules regulating the conditions of service if any be applicable and ordinarily in such a situation the <ORG> will take this course But the <ORG> may take the view that a simple termination of service is not enough and that the conduct of the servant has been such that he deserves a punishment entailing penal consequences specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to the infliction of a punishment and does not attract Art But even if the <ORG> has by contract or under the rules the right to terminate the employment without going through the procedure prescribed for inflicting the punishment of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank the <ORG> may nevertheless choose to punish the servant and if the termination of service is sought to be founded on misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification then it is a punishment and the requirements of Art As already stated if the servant has got a right to continue in the post then unless the contract of employment or the rules provide to the contrary his services cannot be terminated otherwise than for misconduct negligence inefficiency or other good and sufficient cause If the <ORG> servant has a right to a particular rank then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty for he will then lose the emoluments and privileges of that rank If however he has no right to the particular rank his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his sub stantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment But the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a lower post or rank cannot in any circumstances be a Punishment The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences Thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the <ORG> bad purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules in truth and reality the <ORG> has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty In spite of the use of such innocuous expressions the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to If the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service or the reversion to his substantive rank must be regarded as a reduction in rank and if the requirements of the rules and Art which give protection to <ORG> servant have not been complied with the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the constitutional right of the servant Applying the principles discussed above it is quite clear that the petitioner before us was appointed to the higher post on an officiating basis that is to say he was appointed to officiate in that post which according to Indian Railway Code corresponding to means that he was appointed only to perform the duties of that post He had no right to continue in that post and under the general law the implied term of such appointment was that it was terminable at any time on reasonable notice by the <ORG> and therefore his reduction did not operate as a forfeiture of any right and could not be described as reduction in rank by way of punishment In these circumstances there is no escape from the conclusion that the petitioner was not reduced in rank by way of punishment and therefore the provisions of Art This appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs applies to all classes of <ORG> servants mentioned in it and that it makes no difference whether they are permanent quasi permanent officiating temporary or on probation I am also clear that Except as expressly provided by this Constitu tion every person etc holds office during the pleasure of the President These words are absolute and leave no room for inference or deduction There are also others such as Arts I also agree with my Lord that the words dismissal removal and reduction in rank used in Art According to the dictionary they mean the same thing or at any rate have subtle shades of distinction that are meaningless in the context in which they are used The word contract is used in Art That also applies to conditions of service where there are no special contracts These conditions confer a right on one side and correspondingly reduce the ambit of the rights conferred by the contract on the other Therefore when <ORG> exercises one of their rights there is no infringement of the other party rights because to that extent he has none It follows that when in a given case <ORG> has an option to adopt one of two courses as for example to dismiss or reduce for misconduct and at the same time to terminate or alter the service under a term of the contract or because of a condition of the service then if it chooses to act under the right conferred by the contract Art will ensue over and beyond those that would ordinarily follow from a normal termination or alteration when there is no misconduct or blame on the part of the person affected Now what happened in this case The appellant was appointed to an <ORG> service of the Union in August for as I said earlier these words have special meaning and do not apply in every case where a person is removed from a higher to a lower post applies even when the appointment is temporary or officiating and on the view I take it does not matter whether <ORG> had what I might call a contractual right to reduce because even if it had it exercised it in a way that evoked evil consequences over and above those that would have ensued in a similar case where there was neither misconduct nor blame We are only concerned with the operative order made by the proper authority competent to make it and with the consequences that ensue from that order It merely says that <NAME> is appointed to officiate in the appellant place and that on relief the appellant will revert to a lower rank I say this because quite obviously the constitutional guarantees of Art I do not mean to imply that the reasons that lead to an order of reduction are relevant when there is a contractual right to act in a particular way nor do I mean to imply that a mere recording of disappointment or dissatisfaction would attract Art If I read his judgment aright I gather that his view and that of my learned brothers is that Art The real test is do they in fact ensue as a consequence of the order made I would allow the appeal with costs In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeal is dismissed with costs
