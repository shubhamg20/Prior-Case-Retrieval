On appeal by special leave the appellant contended inter alia that since the <ORG> had not gone into the question of the applicability to the assessee of the Concessions Order and had not expressed any opinion thereon <ORG> could not raise the question on its own and decide it Held that <ORG> exceeded its jurisdiction in going outside the point of law decided by the <ORG> and deciding a different point of law Section of the Income tax Act which confers jurisdiction upon <ORG> only permits a reference of a question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> It does not confer jurisdiction on <ORG> to decide a different question of law not arising out of such order The <ORG> pointed out that the dividends were declared by <ORG> out of its profits which had accrued partly in what was then called British India and partly in the Indian State accrued to the assessee in the former Baroda State or whether it is income accrued or deemed to have accrued to the assessee in British India When the reference was heard <ORG> was of the opinion that the <ORG> ought to have decided and referred also the question whether the Concessions Order applied to the assessee <ORG> however by its order dated September decided that there was no need to send the case back for a supplemental statement since all the facts necessary to decide the two questions were before <ORG> <ORG> then reframed the question as it said to comprehend the two points of law in the following words Whether the assessee is entitled to any concession under the Merged States Taxation Concessions Order with regard to the net dividend income of Rs The learned counsel for the Commissioner on the other hand contends that the question was the assessability of the assessee who claimed the benefit of the Concessions Order It decided the question of assessability on the short ground that the income had not arisen in Baroda but in British India That question can be adequately decided on the facts of this case without advertence to the Concessions Order Section of the Income tax Act which confers jurisdiction upon <ORG> only permits a reference of a question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> It does not confer jurisdiction on <ORG> to decide a different question of law Dot arising out of such order It is possible that the same question of law may involve different approaches for its solution and <ORG> may amplify the question to take in all the approaches
