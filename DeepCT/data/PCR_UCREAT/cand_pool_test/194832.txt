carried on by a processor on job work basis in respect of grey cotton fabrics and man made fabrics belonging to the customer and entrusted by him for processing amount to manufacture within the meaning of the Central Excises and Salt Act as it stood prior to its amendment by the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duty of Excise Amendment Act so as to attract levy of excise duty on the processed fabrics and whether in any event after the Amendment Act these processes amount to manufacture and excise duty is leviable on the processed fabrics The other question is whether even if the processed fabrics are assessable to excise duty in the hands of the processor who carries on these processes on job work basis what is the value on the basis of which the processed fabrics are liable to be assessed carried out by the processors on job work basis amount to manufacture both under the Act as it stood prior to the amendment as also under the Act subsequent to the amendment and the processed fabrics are liable to be assessed to excise duty in the hands of what may be called jobbers Since this was a decision given by a Bench of three Judges the petitioners and appellants who are carrying on business of processing on job work basis could not contend that these processes do not amount to manufacture and that the processed fabrics are not liable to be assessed to excise duty in the hands of the jobbers But it was the second question which provoked serious controversy before us So far as this question is concerned it was also incidentally argued in <ORG> case supra and <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> observed as follows at pp of <ORG> When the textile fabrics are subjected to the processes like bleaching dyeing and printing etc by independent processes whether on their own account or on job charges basis the value for the purposes of assessment under Section Central Excises Act will not be the processing charges alone but the intrinsic value of the processed fabrics which is the price at which such fabrics are sold for the first time in the wholesale market The value would naturally include the value of grey fabrics supplied to the independent processors to be utilised for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance with Rule A or of the Central Excises Rules as the case may be The learned Counsel for the petitioners and the appellants contended that these observations did not represent the correct law on the subject and that this question was required to be reconsidered in some depth because it vitally affected the processors who were carrying on processing of cotton and man made fabrics on job work basis It was common ground between the parties that the procedure followed by the excise authorities was that the trader who entrusted cotton or man made fabrics to the processor for processing on job work basis would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market and that would be taken by the excise authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabrics and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis This may be illustrated by giving the following example Value of grey cloth in the hands of the processor Rs The assessable value in the case given in this example would be taken by the Excise authorities at Rs There were also instances where on finding that the trader had sold the processed fabrics in the market at a higher rate than that mentioned in the declaration the excise authorities raised a further demand against the processor for excise duty on the basis of such higher price It was also contended in the alternative by the learned Counsel that in any event the assessable value of the processed fabric could not possibly include the profit at which the trader sold the processed fabric since the processor was concerned only with the processing of the gray fabric and was not concerned with the sale which the trader might effect after the processing was done and the manufacture of processed fabric was completed We do not agree with the first contention of the learned Counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the appellants but the alternative contention urged by him is certainly well founded that under the Central Excises and Salt Act and the Rules made thereunder the assessable value of the manufactured goods is to be determined at the factory gate that is at the stage when the manufactured goods leave the factory and enter the main stream We cannot accept the contention of the learned Counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the appellants that the value of the grey cloth which is processed by the processor should not be included in the assessable value of the processed fabric since the grey cloth is one of the raw materials which goes into the manufacture of the processed fabric and the value of the processed fabric cannot be computed without including the value of the raw material that goes into its manufacture The assessable value of the processed fabric cannot therefore be limited merely to the value of the job work done but it must be determined by reference to the wholesale cash price of the processed fabric at the gate of the factory of the processor which the trader may make by selling the processed fabric cannot be included in the assessable value The element of selling profit of the trader would be entirely an extraneous element and it cannot be taken into account for the purpose of determining the assessable value of the processed fabric which would comprise the value of the grey cloth and the job work charges but exclude the profit at which the trader may subsequently sell the processed fabric We would have proceeded to decide these writ petitions and appellants appeals on the basis of this view which we are inclined to take but we find that in <ORG> case supra <NAME> <NAME> speaking on behalf of a Bench of three Judges has expressed a view which is different from the one we are taking and though that view has been expressed by <NAME> <NAME> incidentally we do not think it would be right for us to ignore what <NAME> <NAME> has said and to proceed to take a view different from that taken by him on behalf of the Bench Of course when these writ petitions and appeals are referred to the larger Bench it will be open to the larger Bench to consider not only the question of determination of the assessable value but also the other question namely whether processing of grey fabric by a processor on job work basis constitutes manufacture because the judgment in <ORG> case supra which has decided this question in favour of the Revenue and against the processor is a judgment of a Bench of only three Judges and now the present writ petitions and appeals will be heard by a Bench of five Judges
