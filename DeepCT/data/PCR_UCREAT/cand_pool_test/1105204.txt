They purchased raw skins from places both within and outside the State of Madras tanned the same and sold them through their agents in Madras They were assessed to a certain amount of sales tax in accordance with the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act and ii of the Madras General Sales Tax Turnover and Assessment Rules on the turnover of hides and skins purchased in the untanned condition outside the State and tanned within the State with respect to the assessment years The petitioners filed three writ petitions under Art Raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins constitute different commodities for merchandise and hence can be treated as different goods for the purposes of the Act by the petitioners which is a partnership firm praying fora declaration that of the Madras General Sales Tax Special Provisions Act Act No of hereinafter called the Act is ultra vires the Constitution and of no effect and for a writ of mandamus directing the State of Madras to

the Madras General Sales Tax Turnover and Assessment Rules on the turnover of hides and skins purchased in the untanned condition outside the State but tanned within the State with respect to each of the assessment years and The petitioners challenged earlier the validity of on the ground that it contravened Art The petitioners then filed writ petition No of in this Court against the assessment of tax for the year State of Madras that of the rules was invalid as it discriminated against the imported hides and skins which had been purchased or tanned outside the State Those writs were filed on March and it was contended that subrule standing by itself was ultra vires the Constitution as it had the effect of selecting for discriminatory taxation only raw hides and skins and leaving un taxed sales of tanned hides and skins in Madras It is therefore considered necessary to avoid these difficulties by removing the discrimination in the matter of levy of SUPP Special provisions in respect of tax on sale of hides and skins in certain cases Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madras General Sales Tax Act Madras Act IX of hereinafter referred to as the said Act or in the rules made thereunder hereinafter referred to as the said rules the following provisions shall apply in respect of tax on sale of hides and skins during the period commencing on the st April and ending on the st

the tax under the said Act shall be levied from the dealer who in the <ORG> is the first seller in such hides and skins not exempt from taxation under sub section of section of the said Act at the rate of two percent of the amount for which such hides and skins were last purchased in the untanned condition Any dealer in hides and skins who has been finally assessed under the provisions of the said Act and the said rules may within a period of ninety days from the date of the commencement of this Ordinance apply to the authority or officer concerned for reassessment under the provisions of this Ordinance along with the correct and complete return Subject to the provisions of sub section the provisions of the said Act and the said rules shall be deem ed to be in force for the purpose of

said rules it shall be competent for the authority or officer concerned to assess or reassess and recover the tax on sale of hides and skins during the period mentioned in sub section as if this Ordinance had been in fore at the relevant time The amount of tax on sale of hides and skins during the period mentioned in sub section already collected from any dealer shall be adjusted towards the tax due from him on such sale as a result of assessment or re assessment in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance and it the tax on such assessment or reassessment i is in excess of the amount of tax on such sale of hides and skins already collected from such dealer such excess shall be recovered from him or ii is less than the amount of tax on such sale of hides and skins already collected from such dealer the difference shall be refunded to him Sub of I provided that the Act would be deemed to have come into force on June Subsection of of the Act reads Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madras General Sales Tax Act Madras Act IX of hereinafter referred to as the said Act or in the rules made thereunder hereinafter referred to as the said rules during the period commencing on the st April and ending on the st March in respect of sale of dressed hides and skins which were not subjected to tax under the said Act as raw hides and skins the tax under the said Act shall be levied from the dealer who in the State is the first seller in such hides and skins not exempt from taxation under sub section of section of the said Act at the rate of two per cent of the amount for which such hides and skins were last purchased in the untanned condition Persons who had purchased raw hides and skins in the <ORG> of Madras in the years and paid sales tax at pies per rupee and paid no further tax when those hides after being tanned were sold The petitioners having purchased raw hides and skins from outside the <ORG> did not at the time pay tax at that rate on the purchase price of the raw hides and skins but were now liable under the impugned provision to pay tax at the rate of per cent of the amount for which such hides and skins were last purchased in untanned condition Thus the petitioners would pay a higher tax than what was paid by the seller of dressed hides and skins purchased in the <ORG> in the raw condition and then tanned and sold and that therefore discriminates against imported untanned hides and skins It follows that no tax on sale of raw hides and skins during the period is valid and that therefore the imposition of a tax under sub section of of the impugned Act imposes a tax on the imported hides and skins when sold in the <ORG> in the tanned condition while no tax is to be levied on the sale of the hides and skins purchased in the <ORG> in the raw condition then tanned and sold No discrimination is made between locally tanned goods and outside tanned goods as in both cases tax is levied on the first sale of such goods within the <ORG> It is not correct that will not apply to a dealer purchasing tanned hides and skins outside the State and selling them within the State as it stood prior to the amendment in imposed fetters only on post Constitutional law and therefore it could not operate on the Madras General Sales Tax Act which had been enacted much earlier The impugned sub section provides for the assessment of tax on the sale of dressed hides and skins which were not subjected to tax under the Act as raw hides and skins and thus exempts from taxation in accordance with the provisions of sub section of of the Act the sale of tanned hides and skins with respect to which tax had been paid on their sale in the raw condition There is no escape from this conclusion which those hides and skins were last purchased in the un tanned condition but on account of the fact that the rate of tax on the sale of tanned hides and skins is higher than that on the sale of untanned hides and skins There is nothing in sub section of of the Act to suggest that the seller of the tanned hides and skins in the <ORG> should himself be the purchaser of those hides and skins in the raw condition from outside the <ORG> and that therefore tax cannot be levied on the sale of hides and skins in the raw condition when no tax is levied on the sale of hides and skins in the tanned condition The petitioners rely on two cases in support of their contention that the tanned and untanned hides and skins do not form different commodities but constitute one commodity Since skins tanned or untanned constitute only one class of goods and the sale of that class of goods can be taxed only at a single point obviously there can be no tax on a sale of tanned goods if tax has already been paid on an earlier transaction when those skins were untanned It was taken into consideration that the Constitution as well as the statutes dealing There is no good reason why the legislature be not attributed the same inten tion when it enacted the Act especially when there are other reasons also to point to the same conclusion We therefore hold that raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins constitute different commodities of merchandise and they could therefore be treated as different goods for the purposes of the Act vi the sale of hides and skins whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under section sub section only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed The only question that now remains for consideration is whether the State legislature was competent to enact the provisions of sub section of of the Act of the Constitution as it stood before its amendment by the Consti tution VI Amendment Act of on September read No law made by <ORG> State imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent Consequently there was no Constitutional requirement for the Act being reserved for the assent of the President before it could be enforced It is contended for the petitioner that the Act really enacted for a period when if passed it bad to receive the President assent for its enforcement and that therefore <ORG> could not even in enact this provision affecting the taxation law in respect of the sale or purchase of goods which were goods declared essential for the of the commissioner We there fore do not agree with this contention <ORG> was doing in what the legislature enacting the Act was supposed to have enacted and therefore its enactment was not governed by the Constitutional requirement for an Act to be enacted during the period Act LII of was in force There is no force in this contention The tax is imposed on the sale which took place within the <ORG> The Act makes provision for a period We therefore hold that sub section of of the Act discriminates against imported hides and skins which were sold up to the st of August upto which date the tax on sale of raw hides and skins was at the rate of pies per rupee or th percent This however does not mean that the sub section is valid with respect to the sales which took place subsequent to August
