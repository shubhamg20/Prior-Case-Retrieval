The decree holder is <ORG> who gave financial accommodation to a concern called <ORG> which commenced in and did business in timber banking and soon The appellant who was one of the partners filed an application Ex He was admittedly living at Kozhikode away from his tarwad working as an insurance agent and said that he was earning about Rs Mr <NAME> has strenuously urged that the decree holder bank has not discharged the onus placed upon them under Section proviso a that after the institution of the suit the judgment debtor has dishonestly transferred concealed or removed any part of his property and under proviso that he has or has had since the date of the decree the means to pay the amount of decree or some substantial part thereof and refuses or neglects to do so It is true that in this case the decree holder has not been able to point precisely to any particular dishonest transfer or concealment or to specific money in possession of the judgment debtor out of which he could have paid the decretal amount since the date of the decree If the extreme view urged by Mr <NAME> is to be accepted that before a judgment debtor can be committed to prison a decree holder is bound to establish by strict evidence and proof that there has been a dishonest transfer by a registered document or a concealment of assets in some other manner or that the judgment debtor had in his actual possession in his own house a sum of money out of which he could have paid or discharged a substantial portion of the decree a premium would be put on evasion by judgment debtors rendering decrees obtained at great cost and expense nullified and the pendulum will so swing in a direction in favour of judgment debtors that legislation for the protection of decree holders may have to be introduced In my view it is perfectly open to a <ORG> to apply a judicial corrective to the extreme lengths to which the onus which Act of casts on decree holders is sought to be taken by adopting the view that it is perfectly open to an executing <ORG> on all the material placed before it to come to an inference as regards the statutory findings required by provisos a and of Section Civil It is no doubt true that the onus rests on the creditor to prove the debtor ability to pay and mere disbelief of the latter statement that he had no means to pay is not sufficient Where however there is sufficient material shown to warrant an inference as in the present case that the judgment debtor has actually been in the possession of substantial assets a few months prior to suit an inference is perfectly justifiable that he has since the institution of the suit dishonestly concealed them and furthermore that he has since the date of the decree means to pay a substantial portion of it from assets he is concealing from the <ORG> We can find no real grounds for setting aside the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge on the material placed before him The fixation of installments helps to sridge the wide gulf between the dismissal of an execution petition for arrest on a decree holder failing strictly to discharge the onus resting on him under the proviso to Section and the commitment to prison of a judgment debtor who while in a position to pay something simply cannot discharge the decree in full as he has no immediate means to do it
