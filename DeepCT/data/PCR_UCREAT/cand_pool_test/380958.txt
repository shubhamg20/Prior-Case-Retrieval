HEADNOTE In March after obtaining the satisfaction of the Commissioner the appellant issued a notice under of the Income Tax Act stating that he had reason to believe that the respondent income chargeable to tax for the assessment year had escaped assessment Dismissing the appeal HELD <ORG> was right in holding that the material before the Income Tax Officer could not have led to the formation of the belief that the income of the assessee had escaped assessment because of his failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts a The two conditions required to be satisfied before the Income Tax Officer issued a notice under of the Income Tax Act are that he must have reason to believe i that the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment and ii that such income had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of assessee to disclose fully and truly material facts necessary for assessment for that year Once there exist reasonable grounds for the Income Tax Officer to form the above belief that would be sufficient to clothe him with jurisdiction to issue notice While the sufficiency of grounds which induce the Income Tax Officer to act is not justiciable it is open to the assessee to contend that the Income Tax Officer did not hold the belief that there was such non disclosure The first ground mentioned by the Income Tax Officer could not have led to the formation of the belief that the income of the respondent had escaped assessment for that year because of his failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts As regards the second ground there is nothing to show that the confession of another person related to a loan to the assessee and not to someone else There is no indication as to when the confession was made and whether it related to the assessment year sought to be re opened The fact that the words definite information in of Act before its amendment in do not find a place in would not lead to the conclusion that action could now be taken for reopening assessment even if the information was wholly vague indefinite far fetched and remote The powers of the Income Tax Officer to reopen assessment though wide are not plenary The provisions of the Act depart from the normal rule that there should be finality about orders made in judicial and quasi judicial proceedings The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal on certificate is against the <ORG> judgment of <ORG> whereby on petition under article of the Constitution of India filed by the respondent that court by majority quashed notice under section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act issued by appeallant No Income tax Officer Ward Hundi Circle Calcutta hereinafter referred to as the appellant for the purpose of reopening assessment of the income of the respondent for the assessment year On March the respondent received notice dated March issued by the appellant under section of the Act stating that the appellant had reason to believe that the respondent income which was chargeable to tax for the assessment year had escaped assessment within the meaning of section of the Act and that the notice was being issued after obtaining the necessary satisfaction of the Commissioner of Income tax On May the respondent through his lawyer stated that there was no material on which the appellant had reason to believe that the respondent income had escaped assessment and therefore the condition precedent for the assumption of jurisdiction by the appellant had not been satisfied The appellant was also called upon to furnish all the materials on which he had reason to believe that income had escaped assessment As according to the respondent there was no satisfactory response from the appellant he filed petition under article of the Constitution for quashing the impugned notice The Income tax Officer had reason to believe and bona fide believed that the said alleged loans and the interest alleged to have been paid thereon are not genuine If necessary I crave leave to produce before the hon ble Judge hearing the application the relevant records on the basis of which the said Income tax Officer had reason to believe that the income of the petitioner escaped assessment as aforesaid at the hearing of the application The assessee is still claiming that the credits are genuine in the assessment proceedings for All the three Judges who constituted <ORG> found that the assessee was not being charged with omission to disclose all facts he was charged for having made an untrue disclosure because the assessee had stated that he had received certain sums of money from certain persons as loans when in fact he had not received any sum at all from these persons It was also stated by the assessee at the time of the original assessment that he had paid interest to certain persons when in fact he had not if the information received later was true In the result by majority <ORG> quashed the notice issued by the appellant to the respondent Dr <NAME> has in his own turn assailed the finding of all the three learned Judges of <ORG> in so far as they have held that the assessee was being charged with omission to disclose true facts Contention has also been advanced by Dr <NAME> that the material on the basis of which the Income tax Officer initiated these proceedings for reopening the assessment did not have a rational connection with the formation of the belief that the assessee had not made a true disclosure of the facts at the time of the original assessment Sections and which deal with income escaping assessment and issue of notice where income has escaped assessment read as under a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return under section for any assessment year to the Income tax Officer or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may subject to the provisions of section to assess or ressess such income or recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance as the case may be for the assessment year concerned hereinafter in sections to referred to as the relevant assessment year For the purposes of this section the following shall also be deemed to be cases where income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment namely a where income chargeable to tax has been under assessed or where such income has been assessed at too low a rate or where such income has been made the subject of excessive relief under this Act or under the Indian Income tax Act XI of or where excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed Issue of notice where income has escaped assessment Before making the assessment reassessment or recomputation under section the Income tax Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Sub section of section prescribes the time limit for notice and reads as under No notice under section shall be issued a in cases falling under clause a of section i for the relevant assessment year if eight years have elapsed from the end of that year unless the case falls under sub clause ii ii for the relevant assessment year where eight years but not more than sixteen years have elapsed from the end of that year unless the income chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to rupees fifty thousand or more for that year in cases falling under clause of section at any time after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year No notice shall be issued under section after the expiry of eight years from the end of the relevant assessment year unless the <ORG> is satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Income tax Officer that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice No notice shall be issued under section after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year unless the Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Income tax Officer that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice The provisions of sections to of the Act correspond to those of section of the Indian Income tax Act It would appear from the perusal of the provisions reproduced above that two conditions have to be satisfied before an Income tax Officer acquires jurisdiction to issue notice under section in respect of an assessment beyond the period of four years but within a period of eight years from the end of the relevant year viz the Income tax Officer must have reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and he must have reason to believe that such income has escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee a to make a return under section for the assessment year to the Income tax Officer or to disclose fully and truly material facts necessary for his assessment for that year It is no responsibility of the assessee to advise the Income tax Officer with regard to the inference which he should draw from the primary facts The grounds or reasons which lead to the formation of the belief contemplated by section a of the Act must have a material bearing on the question of escapement of income of the assessee from assessment because of his failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts Once there exist reasonable grounds for the Income tax Officer to form the above belief that would be sufficient to clothe him with jurisdiction to issue notice Keeping the above principles in view we may now turn our attention to the facts of the present case Two grounds were mentioned in the report made by the Income tax Officer for reopening the assessment of the assessee respondent with a view to show that his income had been under assessed because of his failure to disclose fully and truly material facts necessary for the assessment Regarding that ground the learned Judge who was in the minority observed that no basis had been indicated as to how it became known that those creditors were known namelenders and when it was known In that case the Income tax Officer while submitting a report to the Commissioner of Income tax for obtaining his sanction with a view to issue notice under section of the Act stated During the year the assessee has shown to have taken loans from various parties of Calcutta In dealing with that report this Court observed From the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner it is clear that he could not have had reasons to believe that by reason of the assessee omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for the accounting year in question income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year nor could it be said that he as a consequence of information in his possession had reasons to believe that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year could not have led to the formation of the belief that the income of the respondent assessee chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for that year because of the failure or omission of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts We may now deal with the first ground mentioned in the report of the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner of Income tax This ground relates to <NAME> against whose name there was an entry about the payment of Rs There is nothing to show that the above confession related to a loan to the assessee and not to someone else much less to the loan of Rs There is also no indication as to when that confession was made and whether it relates to the period from April to March which is the subject matter of the assessment sought to be reopened Rational connection postulates that there must be a direct nexus or live link between the material coming to the notice of the Income tax Officer and the formation of his belief that there has been escapement of the income of the assessee from assessment in the particular year because of his failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts At the same time we have to bear in mind that it is not any and every material howsoever vague and indefinite or distant remote and far fetched which would warrant the formation of the belief relating to escapement of the income of the assessee from assessment The powers of the Income tax Officer to reopen assessment though wide are not plenary The Act no doubt contemplates the reopening of the assessment if grounds exist for believing that income of the assessee has escaped assessment The provisions of the Act in this respect depart from the normal rule that there should be subject to right of appeal and revision finality about orders made in judicial and quasi judicial proceedings The live link or close nexus which should be there between the material before the Income tax Officer in the present case and the belief which he was to form regarding the escapement of the income of the assessee from assessment because of the latter failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts was missing in the case The majority of the learned Judges in <ORG> in our opinion were not in error in holding that the said material could not have led to the formation of the belief that the income of the assessee respondent had escaped assessment because of his failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts We would therefore uphold the view of the majority and dismiss the appeal with costs
