Appellant <NAME> Accused No and his present wife <NAME> Accused No were charge sheeted for the offences punishable under Sections A read with Section for having in furtherance of their common intention kidnapped a minor girl and accused No had committed rape on her several times and committed the murder by strangulation The second accused his wife was convicted for the offences punishable under Section A read with Section and sentenced to suffer RI for five years and to pay a fine of Rs in default and to suffer RI for one month The High <ORG> dismissed the appeal and the reference made by the Sessions <ORG> was accepted and the death sentence was confirmed Appellant has preferred these two appeals against those orders The facts giving rise to these appeals are as follows The deceased a minor girl aged about years was living with her grandmother PW at Gunwant Khandare in Gunwant Maharaj Sansthan at Lakhnwadi The accused persons then on took the girl to the house of one <NAME> PW whom they know earlier The prosecution examined witnesses and relied upon several documents including the experts evidence No witness was examined on the side of the defence We are in these appeals primarily concerned with the question whether the death sentence awarded to <NAME> is sustainable or not and whether the case falls under the category of rarest of rare cases warranting capital punishment We heard <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the accused and <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> at length <NAME> submitted that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who had committed the offence of rape and murder of the deceased girl Further it was pointed out that there was delay in recording the statement of PW by the Police and he was a planted witness Learned counsel also pointed out that if <NAME> had witnessed the accused committing the crime he would have informed the police at the earliest point of time Further it is also pointed out that there were material inconsistencies contradictions and omissions which had seriously affected the prosecution version and that the important links in the chain of circumstances that it was the accused who had committed the crime were missing Learned counsel submitted that <NAME> is a natural witness and he had no motive or any enmity with the accused so as to rope him in the crime Learned counsel submitted that the evidence adduced in this case proved beyond doubt that it was the accused who had kidnapped the minor girl and committed rape on her and later strangulated her to death Learned counsel also submitted that the medical evidence clearly establishes that over and above the commission of the offence of rape the accused had committed the offence of sodomy as well Learned counsel placed reliance on an affidavit and submitted that the accused had previous history of committing various crimes Counsel appearing on either side placed reliance on a number of judgments of this Court to bring home their respective contentions I have critically and minutely gone through the evidence adduced by the prosecution as well as by the defence and examined whether the prosecution had succeeded in establishing the following circumstances to prove the charges levelled against the accused On the age of the girl there was some dispute PW who was conducting the hotel business opposite to the mandir stated that on at about pm one man and woman had come to his hotel and on the next day at about pm they came with a girl aged about years and went to the mandir and he identified both the accused persons in the court On again the accused along with his wife came to the house of <NAME> on a bicycle along with a minor girl who was wearing a white shirt and green skirt <NAME> stated on the next day of the incident that the accused came alone to his house without the girl and left the house along with his wife Evidence of PW is very crucial and there is nothing to show that he had any enmity or grudge against the accused so as to implicate him On internal examination he found following injuries i Injuries over larynx Trachea and bronchi Evidence of fracture of upper two tracheal rings and larynx present Medical evidence clearly indicates that the cause of the death was asphyxia due to strangulation and though there was clear evidence of carnal intercourse the accused was not charged for that offence I have extensively critically and minutely gone through the evidence adduced in this case and I have no doubt in mind that it was the accused who had committed the crime The only question that now remains to be decided is whether this case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases justifying capital punishment and held as follows While considering the question of sentence to be imposed for the offence of murder under Section of the Penal Code the court must have regard to every relevant circumstance relating to the crime as well as the criminal Prima facie it is seen that criminal test has not been satisfied since there was not much discussion on the mitigating circumstances to satisfy the criminal test The <ORG> noticed how diabolically the accused had conceived his plan and brutally executed it in such a calculated cold blooded and brutal murder of a very tender age girl after committing rape on her which according to the <ORG> undoubtedly falls in the rarest of rare case attracting no punishment other than capital punishment This brings us to the question of sentence to be imposed upon the appellant for the offences for which he has been found guilty by the two Courts below as well as by us discussed above Having regard to these principles with regard to the imposition of the extreme penalty it may be noticed that there are absolutely no mitigating circumstances in the present case It appears that the appellant had pre planned to commit the crime by resorting to diabolical methods and it was with that object that he took the girl to a lonely place to execute his dastardly act Obviously her closeness with the appellant encouraged her to go to his shop which was near the saloon where she had gone for a haircut with her father and brother and ask for some biscuits We have very carefully considered the contentions raised on behalf of the parties We have also gone through various decisions of this Court relied upon by the parties in the courts below as well as before us and in our opinion the present case squarely falls in the category of one of the rarest of rare cases and if this be so the courts below have committed no error in awarding capital punishment to each of the accused In a case of this nature in our considered view the capital punishment to both the accused is the only proper punishment and we see no reason to take a different view than the one taken by the courts below The three Judge Bench it is seen has applied both the tests Crime test as well as the Criminal test and found that the case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases This Court following the principles laid down in <NAME> pointed out that when the victim of the murder is an innocent child or a helpless woman or old or infirm person or a person vis vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or a public figure generally loved and respected by the community it is a vital factor justifying award of capital punishment When the <ORG> draws a balance sheet of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances for the purposes of determining whether the extreme sentence of death should be imposed upon the accused or not the scale of justice only tilts against the accused as there is nothing but aggravating circumstances evident from the record of the <ORG> In fact one has to really struggle to find out if there were any mitigating circumstances favouring the accused Court noticed that the accused had no intention to murder her but on the spur of the moment without any premeditation he gave two brick blows which caused the death Criminal test was applied and found some circumstances favouring the accused so as to avoid death sentence This Court noticed that the accused had no previous criminal track record and also there was no evidence that he would be a danger to the society in future The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder rape armed dacoity kidnapping etc by the accused with a prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences committed by the person having a substantial history of serious assaults and criminal convictions The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another serious offence The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear psychosis in the public at large and was committed in a public place by a weapon or device which clearly could be hazardous to the life of more than one person The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like offences to receive money or monetary benefits The offence was committed outrageously for want only while involving inhumane treatment and torture to the victim The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person lawfully carrying out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement of himself or another For instance murder is of a person who had acted in lawful discharge of his duty under Section Code of Criminal Procedure When the victim is innocent helpless or a person relies upon the trust of relationship and social norms like a child helpless woman a daughter or a niece staying with a father uncle and is inflicted with the crime by such a trusted person When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity and meanness When there is a cold blooded murder without provocation The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally defective and the defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the circumstances of his criminal conduct The circumstances which in normal course of life would render such a behavior possible and could have the effect of giving rise to mental imbalance in that given situation like persistent harassment or in fact leading to such a peak of human behavior that in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence Where the <ORG> upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that the crime was not committed in a pre ordained manner and that the death resulted in the course of commission of another crime and that there was a possibility of it being construed as consequences to the commission of the primary crime Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole eye witness though prosecution has brought home the guilt of the accused In <NAME> case this Bench has held that there is no question of balancing the above mentioned circumstances to determine the question whether the case falls into the rarest of rare cases category because the consideration for both are distinct and unrelated In other words the balancing test is not the correct test in deciding whether capital punishment be awarded or not In my considered view that the tests that we have to apply while awarding death sentence are crime test criminal test and the Test and not balancing test To award death sentence the crime test has to be fully satisfied that is and criminal test that is no Mitigating Circumstance favouring the accused If there is any circumstance favouring the accused like lack of intention to commit the crime possibility of reformation young age of the accused not a menace to the society no previous track record etc the criminal test may favour the accused to avoid the capital punishment Even if both the tests are satisfied that is the aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused still we have to apply finally the Rarest of Rare Case test Test Test depends upon the perception of the society that is society centric and not Judge centric that is whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of crimes or not <ORG>s award death sentence since situation demands so due to constitutional compulsion reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the judges We have to apply the above tests in the present case and decide whether the courts below were justified in awarding the death sentence Let us now apply the Test Remember the victim was a minor girl aged years intellectually challenged and elders like the accused have an obligation and duty to take care of such children but the accused has used her as a tool to satisfy his lust Prosecuting agency has also failed in his duty to point out the same to the court that a case had been made out under Section <NAME> has admitted in his cross examination that he had not reported the said fact to the police possibly due to the reason that there was no clear cut legislative provision casting an obligation on him to report to <ORG> or to the <ORG> dealing with sexual offences towards children after having witnessed the incident Article of the Constitution of India confers upon the <ORG> powers to make special provision for children Act of which received the assent of the President on th June Chapter of the Act deals with the Procedure of reporting of cases Any person who fails to report the commission of an offence under sub section of section or section or who fails to record such offence under sub section of section shall be punished with imprisonment of either description which may extend to six months or with fine or with both Any person being in charge of any company or an institution by whatever name called who fails to report the commission of an offence under sub section of section in respect of a subordinate under his control shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine President of India on rd February promulgated an ordinance titled The Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance further to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure Code Indian Evidence Act and the Indian Penal Code The word rape has been replaced by the word sexual assault Whoever commits an offence punishable under sub section I or sub section of Section and in the course of such commission inflicts an injury which causes the death of the person or causes the person to be in a persistent vegetative state shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than twenty years but which may extend to imprisonment for life which shall mean the remainder of that person natural life or with death Therefore a person who commits an offence punishable under sub section and sub section of Section and causes death shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than twelve years but which my extend to imprisonment for life which shall be mean the remainder of that periods natural life or with death Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case I am inclined to convert death sentence awarded to the accused to rigorous imprisonment for life and that all the sentences awarded will run consecutively or wherever children are housed if they come across instances of sexual abuse or assault on a minor child which they believe to have committed or come to know that they are being sexually molested or assaulted are directed to report those facts keeping upmost secrecy to the nearest <ORG> or local police and they depending upon the gravity of the complaint and its genuineness take appropriate follow up action casting no stigma to the child or to the family members Further it is made clear that if the perpetrator of the crime is a family member himself then utmost care be taken and further action be taken in consultation with the mother or other female members of the family of the child bearing in mind the fact that best interest of the child is of paramount consideration they may take further follow up action in consultation with the nearest <ORG> <ORG> or local police in accordance with law Criminal appeals stand dismissed and the death sentence awarded to the accused is converted to that of rigorous imprisonment for life and that all the sentences awarded will run consecutively While entirely agreeing with my learned Brother Justice <NAME> that the conviction of the appellant must be upheld and that all sentences awarded to him must run consecutively I feel it necessary to draw attention to the views expressed by this Court on awarding death penalty or converting it to imprisonment for life in cases concerning rape and murder In other words this Court highlighted the difficulty in the practical application of the rarest of rare principle since there is a lack of empirical data for making the two fold comparison These cases fall in two categories namely those in which the death penalty has been confirmed by this <ORG> and those in which it has been converted to life imprisonment In my view there is a third category consisting of cases which cannot be overlooked in the overall context of a sentencing policy in which this <ORG> has while awarding a sentence of imprisonment for life arrived at what is described as a via media and in which a fixed term of imprisonment exceeding or years with or without remissions has been awarded instead of a death penalty or in which the sentence awarded has been consecutive and not concurrent For the present purposes I will first refer to those somewhat recent cases say over the last about years where the death penalty was converted to imprisonment for life and cull out the main reasons for commuting it However it is necessary to enter two caveats Firstly <ORG> in <NAME> has concluded in paragraph of the Report that normally the punishment for murder is life imprisonment and a death penalty may be imposed only if there are special reasons for doing so The court can depart from that rule and impose the sentence of death only if there are special reasons for doing so Such reasons must be recorded in writing before imposing the death sentence It was further held in paragraph of the Report that the normal rule is of awarding life sentence but death sentence may be awarded only if the alternative of life sentence is unquestionably foreclosed A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality This Court took the view that though the crime was dastardly and the victim was a young pregnant housewife it would not be appropriate to award the death penalty since <ORG> had not upheld the conviction and also due to the passage of time This Court converted the death sentence in the case of <NAME> to imprisonment for life since he had no criminal antecedents there was no possibility of his committing criminal acts of violence he would not continue being a threat to society and he was not the main perpetrator of the crime It was held There is nothing on record to suggest that <NAME> was having any past criminal antecedents or that there is a possibility that the accused would commit criminal acts of violence and would constitute a continuing threat to the society While therefore we uphold his conviction under Sections we commute his sentence of death into imprisonment for life In order to prevent her from raising shouts the appellant tied the salwar around her neck which resulted in strangulation and her death The sentence of death awarded to the accused was converted to one of life imprisonment since he took advantage of finding the victim alone in a lonely place and her murder was not premeditated The test of whether the lesser option was unquestionably foreclosed was adopted by this Court which held We therefore set aside the impugned judgment and restore the conviction passed by the trial court However the lesser option is not unquestionably foreclosed and so we alter the sentence in regard to the offence under Section to imprisonment for life Despite concluding that the crime was serious and heinous and that the accused had a dirty and perverted mind this Court converted the death penalty to one of imprisonment for life since he was not such a dangerous person who would endanger the community and because it was not a case where there was no alternative but to impose the death penalty It reveals a dirty and perverted mind of a human being who has no control over his carnal desires We are also not satisfied that the circumstances of the crime are such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances in favour of the offender Firstly the murder was committed without any premeditation however there is no mention about the rape being not premeditated secondly the absence of any criminal record of the accused and thirdly there being nothing to show that the accused could be a grave danger to society This is what was said he evidence on record discloses that the accused was not having an intention to commit the murder of the girl who accompanied him On the spur of the moment without there being any premeditation he gave two brick blows which caused her death There is nothing on record to indicate that the appellant was having any criminal record nor can he be said to be a grave danger to the society at large This is what was said In the present case there is nothing on record to indicate that the appellant was having any criminal record nor can it be said that he will be a grave danger to the society at large Hence there is no justifiable reason to impose the death sentence This is what this Court held Regarding sentence we would have concurred with <ORG> view that the extreme penalty of death can be chosen for such a crime However the lesser option is not unquestionably foreclosed and so we alter the sentence in regard to the offence under Section to imprisonment for life Considering that the appellant is a young man at the time of the incident his age was about years he was a student there is no record of any previous heinous crime and also there is no evidence that he will be a danger to the society if the death penalty is not awarded Though the offence committed by the appellant deserves severe condemnation and is a most heinous crime but on cumulative facts and circumstances of the case we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of the rare cases It was held The next question that arises for consideration is whether this is a rarest of rare case we do not think that this is a rarest of rare case in which death penalty should be imposed on the appellant The appellant was aged years at the time of the occurrence and there is no evidence that the appellant had been involved in any other criminal case previously and the appellant was a migrant labourer from and was living in impecunious circumstances and it cannot be said that he would be a menace to society in future and no materials are placed before us to draw such a conclusion In the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the trial court was not justified in imposing extreme penalty of death against the respondent and ends of justice would be met in case the sentence of life imprisonment is awarded against the respondent The death sentence awarded to him was converted by this Court to one of life imprisonment since the accused was a young man of years when the incident occurred apparently his behavior in custody was not uncomplimentary he had no previous criminal record and would not be a menace to society This Court took the view that though the rape may be brutal and the offence heinous it could have been a momentary lapse on the part of the accused and was not premeditated The death occurred not as a result of strangulation but because of excessive bleeding The death penalty awarded to them was converted to life imprisonment since the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence and appellant No had expressed remorse in his statement under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure and admitted his guilt Ordinarily this <ORG> having regard to the nature of the offence would not have differed with the opinion of the learned <ORG> as also the High <ORG> in this behalf but it must be borne in mind that the appellants are convicted only on the basis of the circumstantial evidence There are authorities for the proposition that if the evidence is proved by circumstantial evidence ordinarily death penalty would not be awarded The accused was young man of years when the incident occurred he had got married in the meanwhile and had a daughter his father had died a year after his conviction his family faced a dismal future and there was nothing to suggest that he was not capable of reform It was held Furthermore we see that the mitigating circumstances need to be taken into account more particularly that <ORG> has reversed a judgment of acquittal based on circumstantial evidence Undoubtedly also the appellant would have had time for reflection over the events of the last fifteen years and to ponder over the predicament that he now faces the reality that his father died a year after his conviction and the prospect of a dismal future for his young family On the contrary there is nothing to suggest that he would not be capable of reform There are extremely aggravating circumstances as well Nevertheless to our mind the balance sheet tilts marginally in favour of the appellant and the ends of justice would be met if the sentence awarded to him is commuted from death to life imprisonment under Section of the Penal Code the other part of the sentence being retained as it is <NAME> has however drawn a distinction on the facts of that case and the present one and held that as the appellant was a young man only years of age it was obligatory on the trial court to have given a finding as to a possible rehabilitation and reformation and the possibility that he could still become a useful member of society in case he was given a chance to do so Incidentally <NAME> was also years of age when he committed the offence of rape and murder while <NAME> was years of age when he committed the offence This Court held In the present case also we find that when the appellant committed the offence he was a young person aged about years only There is no evidence to show that he had committed the offences of kidnapping rape or murder on any earlier occasion There is nothing on evidence to suggest that he is likely to repeat similar crimes in future Hence following the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> State of Gujarat we convert the death sentence awarded to the appellant to imprisonment for life and direct that the life sentence of the appellant will extend to his full life subject to any remission or commutation at the instance of the <ORG> for good and sufficient reasons A study of the above cases suggests that there are several reasons cumulatively taken for converting the death penalty to that of imprisonment for life In one case commutation was ordered since there was apparently no exceptional feature warranting a death penalty <NAME> and in another case because <ORG> had awarded life sentence but <ORG> enhanced it to death <NAME> It appears that the appellant had preplanned to commit the crime by resorting to diabolical methods and it was with that object that he took the girl to a lonely place to execute his dastardly act In fine the motivation of the perpetrator the vulnerability of the victim the enormity of the crime the execution thereof persuade us to hold that this is a rarest of rare cases where the sentence of death is eminently desirable not only to deter others from committing such atrocious crimes but also to give emphatic expression to society abhorrence of such crimes While on bail he killed five members of the family who had given evidence against him in the case for which he was convicted of rape thereby carrying out the threat he had earlier given So far as accused <NAME> is concerned it is he who had given the threat on the previous occasion that if anybody gives evidence in the rape case the whole family will be wiped off are unable to record our concurrence with the submissions of Mr <NAME> that there are some mitigating circumstances and there is likelihood of the accused being reformed or rehabilitated It certainly makes it a rarest of the rare cases in which there are no extenuating or mitigating circumstances The special reasons for awarding the death penalty were the diabolic and inhuman nature of the crime It was held Considering the view expressed by this Court in <NAME> case and <NAME> case we have no hesitation in holding that the case at hand falls in the rarest of rare category and death sentence awarded by the trial court was appropriate In the ultimate result the judgment of <ORG> is set aside and that of the trial court is restored It was held Considering the view expressed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case and <NAME> case we have no hesitation in holding that the case at hand falls in rarest of rare category and death sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High <ORG> was appropriate This Court held The case at hand falls in the rarest of the rare category That has nothing to do with the question of sentence as has been observed by this <ORG> in various cases while awarding death sentence In the balance sheet of such circumstances the fact that the case rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to play The case at hand falls in the rarest of the rare category This Court awarded the death penalty to all the six accused Considering these factors this Court awarded the death penalty to all the accused and held The murders were not only cruel brutal but were diabolic Above being the position the appeals filed by the accused persons deserve dismissal which we direct and the State appeals deserve to be allowed In <ORG> there was a difference of opinion on the sentence to be awarded one of the learned judges confirmed the death penalty while the other learned judge was of the view that imprisonment for life should be awarded The matter was referred to a third learned judge who agreed with the award of a death penalty Apart from the above it is clear from the recoveries made from his house that this was not the first time that he had committed crimes in other premises also before he was finally caught by the public two days after the present incident while trying to escape from the house of one <NAME> where he made a similar attempt to rob and assault her and in the process causing injuries to her Their expectation from the authority conferred with the power to adjudicate is to inflict the death sentence which is natural and logical However what is more significant is that there are cases where the factors taken into consideration for commuting the death penalty were given a go bye in cases where the death penalty was confirmed We accordingly dismiss the appeals but modify the sentence of death to one for the rest of his life in terms of the judgment in Shraddananda case It was held while modifying the sentence that the accused serve a term of imprisonment of years While we cumulatively examine the various principles and apply them to the facts of the present case it appears to us that the age of the accused possibility of the death of the deceased occurring accidently and the possibility of the accused reforming themselves they cannot be termed as social menace It is unfortunate but a hard fact that all these accused have committed a heinous and inhumane crime for satisfaction of their lust but it cannot be held with certainty that this case falls in the rarest of rare cases On appreciation of the evidence on record and keeping the facts and circumstances of the case in mind we are unable to hold that any other sentence but death would be inadequate Accordingly while commuting the sentence of death to that of life imprisonment years we partially allow their appeals only with regard to the quantum of sentence the death sentence awarded to the convict for the murder of his pregnant friend and pouring acid on her head was converted to sentence of life for a minimum period of years without any remission before his case could be considered for premature release This is what was said by this Court Considering the above aspects we are of the considered view that it is not a case which falls in the category of the rarest of rare cases where imposition of death sentence is imperative Once we draw the balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and examine them in the light of the facts and circumstances of the present case we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that this is not a case where this <ORG> ought to impose the extreme penalty of death upon the accused Therefore while partially accepting the appeals only with regard to quantum of sentence we commute the death sentence awarded to the accused to one of life imprisonment years It was said In view of the above we reach the inescapable conclusion that the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the <ORG> are unfounded The aforesaid judgments make it crystal clear that this Court has merely found out the via media where considering the facts and circumstances of a particular case by way of which it has come to the conclusion that it was not the rarest of rare cases warranting death penalty but a sentence of years or years as referred to in the guidelines laid down by the <ORG>s would be totally inadequate There is no scope of judicial review of such orders except on very limited grounds for example non application of mind while passing the order non consideration of relevant material or if the order suffers from arbitrariness The power to grant pardons and to commute sentences is coupled with a duty to exercise the same fairly and reasonably Considering the totality of facts and circumstances of this case we hold that imposition of death sentence on the appellants was not warranted but while awarding life imprisonment to the appellants we hold that they must serve a minimum of thirty years in jail without remission It was held We have given considered thought to the question and we have not been able to place the case in that category which could be regarded as the rarest of the rare type We therefore commute the sentence of death to one of RI for life imprisonment Since imprisonment for life means that the convict will remain in jail till the end of his normal life what this decision mandates is that if the convict is to be earlier released by the competent authority for any reason in accordance with procedure established by law then the second sentence will commence immediately thereafter This Court converted the death sentence of all three to imprisonment for life since it was not possible to identify whose case would fall in the category of rarest of rare cases It was held Considering the cumulative effect of all the factors it cannot be said that the offences were committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for the whole thing was done in a pre planned way having regard to the nature of offences and circumstances in which they were committed it is not possible for the <ORG> to predict that the appellant would not commit criminal act of violence or would not be a threat to the society Accordingly we modify the sentence awarded by the courts below under Section read with Section from death to life imprisonment There is no other method or procedure From the information available in the annual reports published by <ORG> <ORG> and which is freely available on the internet it appears that between and both years included death sentence has been awarded to as many as persons and one person <NAME> was executed in Perhaps it is not at all clear the <ORG> has also taken into account cases where the death sentence awarded by <ORG> has not been confirmed by <ORG> and those cases where <ORG> has confirmed the sentence but it has been modified by this <ORG> or cases where a plea of not guilty has been accepted by this <ORG> for want of conclusive evidence There are also an extraordinarily high number of commutations granted in Delhi A correspondingly high number of death sentences were not awarded in Delhi in the relevant years but it is difficult to say whether there were such a large number of pending death sentences awaiting execution The commutation figures given by the <ORG> may not be entirely reliable but in any case there is no reason to doubt the correctness of the number of death sentences awarded which too is rather high making it unclear whether death penalty is really being awarded only in the rarest of rare cases Was the reason for commutation that the crime and the criminal did not fall in the category of rarest of rare and if so what was the basis for coming to this conclusion when the competent Court has come to a different conclusion It seems to me that though the <ORG> have been applying the rarest of rare principle the <ORG> has taken into consideration some factors not known to the <ORG> for converting a death sentence to imprisonment for life While agreeing with my learned Brother Justice <NAME> that the conviction of the appellant should be upheld but keeping the above discussion in mind I endorse the direction that all the sentences awarded to the appellant should run consecutively
