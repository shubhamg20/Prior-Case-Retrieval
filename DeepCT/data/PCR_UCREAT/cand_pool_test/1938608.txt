Inspite of the huge potential there was hardly any development of the Narmada water resources prior to independence The Consultants also stated that there was scope for extending irrigation from the high level canal towards the Rann of Kutch The main reason for the objection was that if these projects were implemented the same would prejudicially affect the rights and interests of Gujarat State by compelling it to restrict the height of the dam at Navagam to FRL ft The Reference being in the following terms In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of Section of the Inter State Water Disputes Act <ORG> hereby refers to <ORG> for adjudication of the water dispute regarding the inter State river Narmada and the river valley thereof emerging from letter No MIP dated the th July from <ORG> The <ORG> framed issues which included the issues relating to the Gujarat having a right to construct a high dam with FRL feet and a canal with FSL feet or thereabouts It was held that the Notification of <ORG> dated th October referring the matters raised by the State of Rajasthan by its complaint was ultra vires of the Act but constitution of the <ORG> and making a reference of the water dispute regarding the Inter State river Narmada was not ultra vires of the Act and the <ORG> had jurisdiction to decide the dispute referred to it at the instance of State of Gujarat It also held that it had the jurisdiction to give appropriate direction to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra to take steps by way of acquisition or otherwise for making submerged land available to Gujarat in order to enable it to execute <ORG> and the <ORG> had the jurisdiction to give consequent directions to Gujarat and other party States regarding payment of compensation to Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh for giving them a share in the beneficial use of Navagam dam and for rehabilitation of displaced persons Against the aforesaid judgment of the <ORG> on the preliminary issues the States of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan filed appeals by special leave to this Court and obtained a stay of the proceedings before the <ORG> to a limited extent The height of the Navagam Dam was to be fixed by the <ORG> after taking into consideration various contentions and submissions of the parties and it was agreed that the appeals filed in this Court by the States of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan would be withdrawn An important mandatory provision regarding rehabilitation was the one contained in Clause XI sub clause IV ii which stated that no submergence of any area would take place unless the oustees were rehabilitated The <ORG> in its Award directed for the constitution of an inter State Administrative Authority i <ORG> for the purpose of securing compliance with and implementation of the decision and directions of the <ORG> In addition thereto there are number of technical persons like Chief Engineers as the members This <ORG><ORG><ORG> was appointed with a view to ensure that the environmental safeguards were properly planned and implemented On th September this Court in the said Writ Petition bearing No of gave a direction to constitute the Committee headed by Secretary <ORG> to monitor the rehabilitation aspects of <ORG> In April the petitioner filed the present writ petition inter alia praying that <ORG> and other respondents should be restrained from proceeding with the construction of the dam and they should be ordered to open the aforesaid sluices It then addressed itself to the question whether there were any compelling reasons After taking into consideration the views of the States of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat the three Members observed as follows We find that the <ORG> idea of phased construction outlined earlier offers a practical solution it does not prevent the FRL from being raised to in due course if the necessary conditions are satisfied and it enables <ORG> to take stock of the position at and call a halt if necessary We first propose to deal with some legal issues before considering the various submissions made by <NAME> regarding environment relief and rehabilitation alleged violation of rights of the tribals and the need for review of the project It has sought to contend that there was lack of study available regarding the environmental aspects and also because of the seismicity the clearance should not have been granted Thereafter there was an agreement of the four Chief Ministers in namely the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh Gujarat Maharashtra and Rajasthan for the project to be undertaken Then dispute arose with regard to the height of the dam which was settled with the award of the <ORG> being given in This <ORG> has entertained this petition with a view to satisfy itself that there is proper implementation of the relief and rehabilitation measurers at least to the extent they have been ordered by the Tribunals Award Briefly stated the <ORG> had in no uncertain terms come to the conclusion that the height of the dam should be ft It had rejected the contention of the State of Madhya Pradesh for fixing the height at a lower level A dispute or difference between two or more State Governments having arisen which is a water dispute under Section of the Act and complaint to that effect being made to <ORG> under Section of the said Act <ORG> constitutes <ORG> for the adjudication of the dispute in question once it forms the opinion that the dispute cannot be settled by negotiations On consideration of such decision of the <ORG> if <ORG> or any State Government is of the opinion that the decision in question requires explanation or that guidance is needed upon any point not originally referred to the <ORG> then within three months from the date of the decision reference can be made to the <ORG> for further consideration and the said <ORG> then forwards to <ORG> a further report giving such explanation or guidance as it deems fit Thereby the original decision of the <ORG> is modified to the extent indicated in the further decision as provided under Section of the Act The language of the provisions of Section is clear and unambiguous and unequivocally indicates that it is only the decision of the <ORG> which is required to be published in the Official Gazette and on such publication that decision becomes final and binding on the parties We therefore do not propose to deal with any contention which in fact seems to challenge the correctness of an issue decided by the <ORG> It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that a project which was sought to be justified on the grounds of providing a permanent solution to water problems of the drought prone areas of Gujarat would touch only the fringes of these areas namely Saurashtra and Kutch and even this water which was allocated on paper would not really accrue due to host of reasons Refuting the aforesaid arguments it has been submitted on behalf of <ORG> and the State of Gujarat that the petitioners have given a highly exaggerated picture of the submergence and other impacts of this project A majority of families of Madhya Pradesh which would include major sons would lose only their houses and not agricultural lands would be required to be resettled in Madhya Pradesh by constructing new houses in the new abadi The rehabilitation package contained in the Award of the Tribunal as improved further by the State of Gujarat and the other States prima facie shows that the land required to be allotted to the tribals is likely to be equal if not better than what they had owned There is merit in the contention of the respondents that there would be a positive impact on preservation of ecology as a result from the project The <ORG> by generating clean eco friendly hydropower will save the air pollution which would otherwise take place by thermal generation power of similar capacity <NAME> submitted that it had become necessary for some independent judicial authority to review the entire project examine the current best estimates of all costs social environmental financial benefits and alternatives in order to determine whether the project is required in its present form in the national interest or whether it needs to be restructured modified RE ENVIRONMENTAL CLERANCE As considerable stress was laid by <NAME> challenging the validity of the environmental clearance granted in inter alia on the ground that it was not preceded by adequate studies and it was not a considered opinion and there was non application of mind while clearing the project we first propose to deal with the contention Learned counsel for the respondents stated that in fact on the examination of the situation the claim made with regard to the satisfactory progress was not correct At this point of time the matter was handled by <ORG> which also had a Department dealing with <ORG> To sort out this matter a meeting was subsequently convened by the Member <ORG> on rd May in which <ORG> took a stand that there was a need for an integrated approach to basin development covering the catchment and command area Proper land use Actions taken by <ORG> in pursuance of <ORG> Report It took the view that following surveys studies as set out therein might take at least years It further took the view that it was essential that there should be a strong management authority <ORG> had not given environmental clearance of Narmada Sagar and Sardar Sarovar Dam despite all discussions which had taken place The documents filed along with the affidavit of <NAME> Under Secretary Prime Ministers Office dated th April indicate that there was difference of opinion with regard to the grant of environmental clearance between <ORG> and <ORG> This note indicated that there were two options with regard to the clearance of the said project One was to await for two to three years for the completion of the operational plans and other detailed studies and the second option was that the project should be given the necessary clearance subject to the stipulation with regard to the action to be taken in connection with various environmental aspects and appropriate monitoring arrangements to ensure that the actions were taken in a time bound manner This <ORG> was not to be mainly a advisory one but was to be given executive powers of enforcement including the power to order stoppage of construction activity in the event of its being of the opinion that there was lack of progress in action on the environmental front In this note it was inter alia stated that there was absence and inadequacy on some important environmental aspects even though the <ORG> was in a fairly advance stage of preparedness It is further stated in the note that <ORG> and the State Governments had no difficulty in accepting conditions ii and iii Discuss It appears that <ORG> gave its clearance to the setting up of <ORG> and on th April following note was prepared and forwarded to the Prime Minister While thanking him for clearing the project it was stated that there was apprehension about the environment and ecological factors and also about the needs of the tribal people Inasmuch as there was some difference of opinion between the Ministries of <ORG> and <ORG> with regard to the grant of environmental clearance the matter was referred to the Prime Minister It is not possible in view of the aforesaid state of affairs for this Court to accept the contention of the petitioner that the environmental clearance of the project was given without application of mind According to <ORG> the conditions imposed in the environmental clearance granted on June were a The <ORG> would ensure that the environmental safeguard measures are planned and implemented pari passu with the progress of work on the project However there is a need to keep a close watch and I am advising the <ORG> for the same Given the experience so far and the fact that most of the impact of submergence on people will not occur until there is still time to develop meaningful packages and programs in consultation with the affected peoples It was submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the command area development was an important aspect as the benefits of the project depended on this and if proper studies and plans were not done and not implemented the very areas that were supposed to benefit will end up being rendered unfit for cultivation and the water logging and salinisation could refer vast areas of the command unproductive After referring to the status reports and studies regarding the command area development it was submitted that there was need for some independent agency to examine the various studies action plans and the experience and to see whether there was ground to believe that the proposed measures will work or not While refuting the aforesaid contentions it was argued on behalf of learned counsel for the respondents that the <ORG> will provide irrigation water for a cultivable command area of million hectares in Gujarat and hectares in Rajasthan There is no reason whatsoever as to why independent experts should be required to examine the quality accuracy recommendations and implementation of the studies carried out <ORG> and <ORG> group in particular have the advantage of having with them the studies which had been carried out and there is no reason to believe that they would not be able to handle any problem if and when it arises or to doubt the correctness of the studies made This contention was based on the terms of the letter dated th June wherein conditional environmental clearance was granted inter alia on the condition that the catchment area treatment programme and rehabilitation plans be drawn so as to be completed ahead of reservoir filling According to the State of Gujarat it had fully complied with the condition by raising afforestation in hectares of non forest areas and hectares in degraded forest areas before against the impoundment area of It was also contended on behalf of the petitioners that downstream impacts of the project would include not only destruction of downstream fisheries one of the most important ones in Gujarat on which thousands of people are dependent but will also result in salt water ingress It was further submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that the potential for environmental changes in the lower river and estuary had to be seen in the context of the long term development of the basin It is also evident that until all the dams are constructed upstream and the entire flow of river is harnessed which is not likely in the foreseeable future there is no question of adverse impact including the fishing activity and the petitioners assertions in this regard are ill conceived It was contended that there was danger of rich historical legacy being lost and even a small increase in the dam height would threaten to submerge many of the sites listed in the report of <ORG> Summary of current situation and progress <ORG> Survey of villages in submergence zone Complete for all items in the State Identification of cultural sites Complete for all items in the State Collection of data and documentation of sites Complete Selection of appropriate sites Complete Action Plan Complete It was further submitted on behalf of respondents that no centrally or state protected cultural sites were located in the submergence area of the project In relation to flora and fauna studies it was contended by the petitioners that the studies had finished only recently and the action plans were awaited in many cases It was observed that the submergence area and catchment area on the right bank of the proposed reservoir exhibited a highly degraded ecosystem which was in contract to the left bank area where there was fairly good forest cover which formed part of Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary It was also contended on behalf of petitioners that the whole project will have serious impacts on health both around the submergence area and in the command The recommendations of <ORG><ORG>Group will have to be considered by the <ORG> and if there is any difference of opinion at that level it will have to be referred to <ORG> which has the Minister of Water and Environment and Forests as a member Emphasis added Apart from the fact that we are not convinced that construction of the dam will result in there being an adverse ecological impact there is no reason to conclude that <ORG><ORG>group is not functioning effectively Though later on a letter of intent had been received by the said company <ORG> did not give its no objection certificate to the location of the industry at the site proposed by it <ORG> while rejecting the application for consent inter alia stated that the unit was a polluting industry which fell under the red category of polluting industry and it would not be desirable to locate such an industry in the catchment area of Himayat Sagar a lake in Andhra Pradesh The appeal filed by the company against the decision of <ORG> was accepted by the appellate authority On the other hand the writ petition filed by the company was allowed and <ORG> directed <ORG> to grant consent subject to such conditions as may be imposed by it After referring to the different concepts in relation to environmental cases like the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle this <ORG> relied upon the earlier decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> Union of India SCC and observed that there was a new concept which places the burden of proof on the developer or industrialist who is proposing to alter the status quo and has become part of our environmental law At page this <ORG> while relying upon a report of <ORG> observed as follows The precautionary principle suggests that where there is an identifiable risk of serious or irreversible harm including for example extinction of species widespread toxic pollution is major threats to essential ecological processes it may be appropriate to place the burden of proof on the person or entity proposing the activity that is potentially harmful to the environment It appears to us that the precautionary principle and the corresponding burden of proof on the person who wants to change the status quo will ordinarily apply in a case of pulluting or other project or industry where the extent of damage likely to be inflicted is not known When there is a state of uncertainty due to lack of data or material about the extent of damage or pollution likely to be caused then in order to maintain the ecology balance the burden of proof that the said balance will be maintained must necessarily be on the industry or the unit which is likely to cause pollution Sustainable development means what type or extent of development can take place which can be sustained by nature ecology with or without mitigation What is the impact on environment with the construction of a dam is well known in India and therefore the decision in <ORG> case supra will have no application in the present case Plaintiff inter alia sought an injunction for restraining the undertaking of the project in violation of the said Act The <ORG> held that notwithstanding the substantial amount of work had already been done in connection with the project but the failure to satisfy full disclosure requirement of NEPA injunction would be issued to halt any further construction until requirements of NEPA had been complied with that even though there was no Act like NEPA in India at the time when environmental clearance was granted in nevertheless by virtue of Stockholm Convention and Article of the Constitution the principles of <ORG> decision should be applied There was at the time when the environmental clearance was granted in no obligation to obtain any statutory clearance Change in environment does not per se violate any right under Article of the Constitution of India especially when ameliorative steps are taken not only to preserve but to improve ecology and environment and in case of displacement prior relief and rehabilitation measures take place pari passu with the construction of the dam It was known that the construction of the dam would result in submergence and the consequent effect which the reservoir will have on the ecology of the surrounding areas was also known Various studies relating to environmental impact some of which have been referred to earlier in this judgment had been carried out The said decision has no application in the present case because there is no such act like the Endangered Species Act in India or a declaration similar to the one which was issued by the Secretary of the <ORG> under that Act In such cases there was a requirement to comply with the provisions of NEPA as already noticed earlier The said notification dated th January inter alia provides as follows Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of Section of the Environment Protection Act read with clause of sub rule of rule of the Environment Protection Rules <ORG> hereby directs that on and from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette expansion or modernization of any activity if pollution load is to exceed the existing one or a new project listed in Schedule I to this notification shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by <ORG> in accordance with the procedure hereinafter specified in this notification RELIEF AND REHABILITATION It is contended by the petitioner that as a result of construction of dam over families will be affected in three States spread over villages It was contended that there was an urgent need to assess comprehensively the totality of the impact and prepare category specific rehabilitation policies for all of them The basis for making this submission is In each village there are many persons left out of the Government list of declared PAFs It is also submitted that there was major lacunae in the said policy like the three States having dissimilar policy for Dealing with the situation of those oustees who have been resettled in Gujarat it is submitted by the petitioner that there are large number of grievances of the said outstees in re settlement sites The petitioner finds fault with the quality of land which has been given in Gujarat to the oustees contending that large number of oustees have been given land outside the command area of irrigation and in some re settlement sites there is a serious water logging problem It also contends that though some amenities have been provided but they are not adequate With regard to Maharashtra it is contended by the petitioner that the official figure of the total number of PAFs affected in Maharashtra is not correct and the number is likely to be more than PAFs estimated by the State of Maharashtra Further more adequate land of desired quality has not been made available for resettlement till mtr Reference is made to the affidavit of the State of Maharashtra in which it is stated that it proposes to ask for the release of hectares of forest land for re settlement and the submission on behalf of the petitioner is that release of such land shall be in violation of Forest Conservation Act and is not in public interest for forest cover will be further depleted With regard to the State of Madhya Pradesh it is submitted that as per the award the <ORG> have a right to choose whether to go to Gujarat or to stay in the home State There is also a complaint regarding the manner in which <ORG> takes decision on the spot when it makes frequent visits It is a case of the petitioners that there is a need for independent monitoring agency in the three States who should be asked to monitor the of the oustees and see to the compliance with the <ORG> award There is partial employment in forestry sector Realising the difficulties of displaced persons the requirement of relief and rehabilitation of PAFs in the case of <ORG> was considered by <ORG> and the decision and final order of the <ORG> given in contains detailed directions in regard to acquisition of land and properties provision for land house plots and civic amenities for the re settlement and rehabilitation of the affected families The submission on behalf of <ORG> was that there was a well<ORG> established mechanism of <ORG> for coordination and monitoring of Re<ORG>settlement Rehabilitation <ORG> programmes in case of <ORG> Except for a bald assertion there appears to be no material on which this <ORG> can come to the conclusion that no proper surveys had been carried out for determining the number of PAFs who would be adversely affected by the construction of the dam There is no requirement that the liberalisation of the packages by three States should be to the same extent and at the same time the States cannot be faulted if the package which is offered though not identical with each other is more liberal than the one envisaged in the Tribunals Award Dealing with the contention of the petitioners that there were large number of persons who were living in the submergence area and were not farmers and would lose their livelihood due to loss of the community and or loss of the river and were not being properly rehabilitated Mr <NAME> learned Senior Counsel contended that this averment was not true Dealing with the contention of the petitioners that there will be canal affected families and they should be treated at par to that of oustees in the submergence area the respondents have broadly submitted that there is a basic difference in the impacts of the projects in the upstream submergence area and its impacts in the beneficiary zone of the command area We agree with this view and that is why in the Award of the Tribunal the State of Gujarat was not required to give to the canal affected people the same relief which was required to be given to the oustees of the submergence area Dealing with the contention of the petitioners that the oustees were not offered a chance to re settle in Gujarat as a community and that there was a clear requirement of village wise communication rehabilitation which had not been complied with the contention of the respondents was that no provision of Tribunals Award had been shown which caused any such obligation on <ORG> Dealing with the contention of the petitioners that there was no provision for grazing land and fuel wood for the PAFs it is rightly contended by the State of Gujarat that grazing land was not mandated or provided for in the Tribunals Award but nevertheless the grazing land of six villages was available for use of PAFs This being so relaxation of cut off date so as to give extra benefit to those sons who attained age of majority at a later date cannot be faulted or criticised Dealing with the contention of the petitioners that there is a need for a review of the project and that an independent agency should monitor the of the oustees and that no construction should be permitted to be undertaken without the clearance of such an authority the respondents are right in submitting that there is no warrant for such a contention There is no basis for contending that some outside agency or <ORG> should see to the compliance of the Tribunal Award By order dated th October this <ORG> in the aforesaid case of <NAME> supra observed that all the directions issued by the <ORG> from time to time have been complied with and nothing more be done in the petition and the petition was disposed off According to this mechanism if a displaced person is aggrieved by the decision of the Rehabilitation Officers in respect of any process he may appeal to the concerned agency officers The <ORG><ORG>group in its th field visit of the <ORG> sites in Gujarat on has noted as follows The <ORG> after the visit and from interaction with the PAFs concluded that there is vast improvement in the conditions of PAFs at these sites as compared to the grievances reported for the same sites during previous visits by the <ORG> NCA officers It is thus seen that there is in place an elaborate network of authorities which have to see to the execution and implementation of the project in terms of the Award On th May this Court directed the State Governments of Gujarat Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra to file affidavits disclosing the latest status of re settlement and rehabilitation work for the existing as well as prospective oustees likely to be affected by raising the height of the dam Pursuant to the said direction affidavits on behalf of the three States have been filed and in response thereto the petitioners have also filed an affidavit The process of re settlement is continuing and reliance is placed on the observation of the <ORG> which has stated in its Fourth Report dated th November that There is substantial compliance of the Re settlement and Rehabilitation measures as mandated by the Final Report of <ORG> including provision of civic amenities and also of all the inter linked provisions of <ORG> and that therefore PAFs from the States of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra affected upto the height of RL mtr The land which is required to be allotted to them is stated to be around hectares and the State of Gujarat has in its possession hectares What is stated in the affidavit is as follows i Since at present <ORG> has sufficient land to meet requirement to accommodate PAFs upto RL it would not be necessary to acquire further land immediately especially when the additional land would be required only after the Sub<ORG>group and Environment Sub<ORG>group give approval for RL to RL after examining the preparedness at different stages All the time of allotment <ORG> would again have to spend a sizeable amount to remove weeds bushes small trees etc The affidavit also gives facts and figures showing that all requisite civic amenities have been developed and made available at the sites A reasoned reply is given to the applicants From the aforesaid affidavit it is more than clear that the <ORG> of which Mr Justice <NAME> is the Chairman has seen to the establishment of different cells and have taken innovative steps with a view to making effective and meaningful In this connection we may take note of the fact that along with the said affidavit <NAME> again under the directions of the <ORG> has given an undertaking to this Court which reads as follows from an existing or proposed new site and if there is a departure from this policy prior approval of the <ORG> will be obtained From what is noticed hereinabove this <ORG> is satisfied that more than adequate steps are being taken by the State of Gujarat not only to implement the Award of the Tribunal to the extent it grants relief to the oustees but the effort is to substantially improve thereon and therefore continued monitoring by this <ORG> may not be necessary those of whom who have opted to go to Gujarat land has been offered to them by <ORG> those PAFs who have changed their mind and now want to remain in Madhya Pradesh land is being shown to them in Madhya Pradesh On the contrary it is stated that no Awards in land acquisition cases have been passed in respect of six villages and it is only after the Awards are passed that house plots will be allotted and compensation paid it is inter alia stated that those losing per cent of their holdings are entitled to be allotted cultivable land and notices were given to them to identify the land which can be allotted There is also a mention in the affidavit filed in the name of <NAME> the petitioner herein not allowing <ORG> to conduct survey for demarcation of the submergence area and identification of the <ORG> to be affected at EL mtrs so that lesser number of people are dislocated but we find that even with regard to the rehabilitation of the oustees at ft There is a method of settling the differences which may arise amongst there like for example in the case of <ORG> water dispute the reference of the same to a <ORG> There are only three sources of water It was of course contended on behalf of the petitioner that if the practice of water harvesting is resorted to and some check dams are constructed there would really be no need for a high dam like Sardar Sarovar There are three stages with regard to the undertaking of an infrastructural project While there is always a need for such projects not being unduly delayed it is at the same time expected that as thorough a study as is possible will be undertaken before a decision is taken to start a project When it has put a system in place for the execution of a project and such a system cannot be said to be arbitrary then the only role which a <ORG> may have to play is to see that the system works in the manner it was envisaged There is no reason now to assume that these authorities will not function properly Any delay in the execution of the project means over run in costs and the decision to undertake a project if challenged after its execution has commenced should be thrown out at the very threshold on the ground of latches if the petitioner had the knowledge of such a decision and could have approached the <ORG> at that time When there is a valid law requiring the <ORG> to act in a particular manner the <ORG> ought not to without striking down the law give any direction which is not in accordance with law When two or more options or views are possible and after considering them the <ORG> takes a policy decision it is then not the function of the <ORG> to go into the matter afresh and in a way sit in appeal over such a policy decision There is no material to enable this Court to come to the conclusion that the decision was mala fide If for one set of people namely those of Gujarat there was only one solution namely construction of a dam the same would have an adverse effect on another set of people whose houses and agricultural land would be submerged in water Perhaps the need for giving the green signal was that while for the people of Gujarat there was no other solution but to provide them with water from Narmada the hardships of oustees from Madhya Pradesh could be mitigated by providing them with alternative lands sites and compensation In governance of the State such decisions have to be taken where there are conflicting interests In the case of projects of national importance where <ORG> and or more than one State are involved and the project would benefit a large section of the society and there is evidence to show that the said project had been contemplated and considered over a period of time at the highest level of the States and the <ORG> and more so when the project is evaluated and approval granted by <ORG> then there should be no occasion for any <ORG> carrying out any review of the same or directing its review by any outside or independent agency or body Once such a decision had been taken that unless and until it can be proved or shown that there is a blatant illegality in the undertaking of the project or in its execution the <ORG> ought not to interfere with the execution of the project That being so there is no reason to suspect with all the experience gained so far that the position here will be any different and there will not be overall improvement and prosperity In this regard the <ORG> would have the jurisdiction to issue necessary directions to the <ORG> which though bound chooses not to carry out its obligations under the Award If there is a short fall in carrying out the measures a time bound direction can and should be given in order to ensure the implementation of the Award Water is the basic need for the survival of human beings and is part of right of life and human rights as enshrined in Article of the Constitution of India and can be served only by providing source of water where there is none There is however perennial shortage of power in India and therefore it is necessary that the generation increases There is therefore international concern for reduction of greenhouse gases which is shared by <ORG> resulting in the restriction of sanction of funds for thermal power projects However each State shall be bound to comply with the directions of the <ORG> with regard to the acquisition of land for the purpose of relief and rehabilitation to the extent and within the period specified by the <ORG>
