The <ORG> did good business and declared high dividends for some time but in the year there was accumulation of stocks and financial difficulties The plaintiff instead of meeting the demand filed the present suit on the th March in a representative capacity on behalf of himself and other preference shareholders against the <ORG> and the Directors appointed by <ORG> challenging the validity of the Ordinance and questioning the right of the Directors to make the call It was alleged in the suit that the Ordinance was illegal and ultra vires and invalid as it contravened the provisions of Section of the Government of India Act and the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and that the resolution of the Directors dated th February making a call was illegal and ultra vires as the law under which they were appointed was itself invalid The suit was dismissed by the Trial Judge and his decision was affirmed on appeal by <ORG> of <ORG> by the Judgment dated th August The plaintiff preferred the present appeal to <ORG> This appeal concerns the validity of the same Ordinance and the Act replacing it which were considered by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> dismissed the petition by a majority of to holding that the presumption in regard to the Constitutionality of the Act had not been displaced by the petitioner and that it had not been proved that the impugned statute was a hostile or discriminatory piece of legislation as against him or that the <ORG> had taken possession of his share The minority held that impugned statute was void as it abridged the petitioner fundamental rights under Article of the Constitution In the present case practically all incidents of ownership have been taken over by the Sate and nothing has been left with the <ORG> but the mere husk of title and in the premises the impugned statute has overstepped the limits of legitimate Social Control Legislation and has infringed the fundamental right of the <ORG> guaranteed to it under Article of the Constitution and is therefore unconstitutional The true approach to this question is that these two Articles really deal with two different subjects and one has no direct relation with the other amely From the language employed in the different sub clauses of Article it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the words acquisition and taking possession used in Article have the same meaning as the word deprivation in Article Article gives complete protection to private property as against executive action no matter by what process a person is deprived of possession of it It has far overstepped the limits of police power and is in substance nothing short of expropriation by way of the exercise of the power of eminent domain and as the law has not provided for any compensation it must be held to offend the provisions of Article Per <NAME> The words taken possession of or acquired in Article have to be read along with the word deprived in clause Each case must depend on its own facts Article is wider than Article which confers upon a citizen only the right to acquire hold and dispose of property and is different in scope and content abridged his fundamental rights conferred under Articles and of the Constitution The minority held that the impugned statute was void as it abridged the petitioner fundamental rights under Art Most of the facts furnishing the cause of action for the suit have been detailed in the judgment of this court in that case but it seems necessary to briefly re state them from a proper appreciation of the contentions that have been raised in the appeal The company did good business and declared high dividends for some time but in the year there was accumulation of stocks and financial difficulties In order to overcome this situation the directors decided to close the <ORG> and on the th July they gave notice of this decision to the workers On the th January the Central <ORG> acting under section of the Ordinance delegated all its powers to the <ORG> of Bombay The plaintiff instead of meeting the demand filed the present suit on the th March in a representative capacity on behalf of himself and other preference shareholders against the company and the directors appointed by the <ORG> of Bombay challenging the validity of the Ordinance and questioning the right of the directors to make the call On the th April a notice was given to the Attorney General of India of the said suit and <ORG> was added as defendant No therein The principal allegations in the suit were that the Ordinance was illegal ultra vires and invalid as it contravened the provisions of section of the Government of India Act and all the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution and that the resolution of the directors dated th February India The plaintiff claimed relief in the form of a declaration regarding the invalidity of the Ordinance and prayed for an injunction restraining the directors from giving effect to the resolution Mr Justice <NAME> who tried the suit framed the following issues therein Whether by the Ordinance the plaintiff and holders of preference shares have been deprived of their interest in the <ORG> defendant company by taking possession of or requisitioning or acquiring the same as alleged in para of the plaint By his judgment dated the th June the learned Judges answered all the three issues in the negative and dismissed the suit and this decision was affirmed on appeal It was held that by force of the Ordinance the <ORG> had neither acquired the property of the plaintiff nor of the company nor had it taken possession of it but that the title to the property and its possession were with the respective owners and the <ORG> was only supervising the affairs of the company through its nominated directors of the Constitution and there had been to him no denial of equality before the law or equal protection of laws as the Ordinance was based on a classification which rested upon a ground having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation and that it had a reasonable basis for that classification It was also held that the restrictions imposed on the right of the appellant and the company to hold his or its property were imposed in the interests of the general public Section is the most material section and is in these terms <ORG> may at any time by notified order appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be directors of the company for the purpose of taking over its management and administration and may appoint one of such directors to be the chairman The provisions of this section are supplemented by what is subsequently provided for in section which provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act or in the memorandum or articles of association of the company it shall not be lawful for the shareholders of the company or any other person to nominate or appoint any person to be a director of the company that no resolution passed at any meeting of the shareholders of the company shall be given effect to unless approved by <ORG> and that no proceeding for the winding up of the company or for the appointment of a receiver in respect thereof shall lie in any court unless by or with the sanction of <ORG> and subject to such exceptions restrictions and limitations as <ORG> may by By section these nominated directors are given powers to raise funds in such manner and offer Such security as they may deem fit They are given the overriding power of cancelling and varying contracts and agreements entered into between the company and any other person at any time if they are satisfied that the contract or the agreement is detrimental to the interests the company The Ordinance thus confers powers on the directors of overriding all contracts and deprives persons who had entered into contracts with the company of their right under the ordinary law to recover compensation Sections and of the Ordinance lay down the method and manner how the existing directors were to give charge of the company affairs and properties The shareholders most valuable right to appoint directors to manage the affairs of the company and be in possession of its property and effect is taken away There can be no doubt that there is force in this contention power and control of <ORG> and the normal function of the company as a corporate body came to an end This argument however overlooks the fact that in order that the possession of the servant or agent may be juridically regarded as the possession of the master or principal the servant or agent must be obedient to and amenable to the directions of the master or principal If the master or principal has no hand in the appointment of the servant or agent or has no control over him or has no power to dismiss or discharge him as in this case the possession of such servant or agent can hardly in law be regarded as the possession of the company In this view of the matter there is great force in the argument that the property of the company has been taken possession of by the <ORG> through directors who have been appointed by the <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by the Ordinance and the Act and who are under the direction and control of the <ORG> and this has been done without payment of any compensation Here therefore it may well be argued that the property of the company having been taken possession of by the <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by a law which does not provide for payment of any compensation the fundamental right of the company has in the eye of the law been infringed To emphasize the same point of view reference was also made to the provisions of the Lunacy Act the provisions of sections A and introduced in the Insurance Act by Act of the provisions of the Railway Companies Emergency Powers Act and also to the provisions of Act of Development of Industries Act and it was contended that the impugned Ordinance was a piece of social control The different Court of Wards Acts being existing laws have been excepted from the fundamental right guaranteed by article Reference may also be made to the observations of Holmes in <ORG> Mahon wherein that learned Judge said as follows As long recognized some values were enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to police power but obviously the implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and due process clauses are gone That being so can it be reasonably held that by promulgating this Ordinance the <ORG> has merely taken over the superintendence of the affairs of the company Or has it in effect and substance taken over the under taking itself Obviously the field of superintendence has to be demarcated from the field of eminent domain It seems to me that under the guise of superintendence the <ORG> is carrying on the business or trade for which This Ordinance in my judgment is an apposite illustration of what <NAME> had in mind when he made the following observations in the case already referred to Where the seemingly absolute protection in respect of private property given by the Constitution is found to be qualified by the police power the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears It was said that unless the property of the company by the provisions of the Ordinance was vested in the <ORG> or was commandeered by the <ORG> for <ORG> purposes article could not be invoked to judge the constitutionality of the Ordinance that article covered within its ambit only two forms of taking of property by the <ORG> namely where the <ORG> acquired title in the property or where the <ORG> temporarily commandeered it and that all other forms of taking the property were outside the fundamental right guaranteed by article It was suggested that the scope of the protection given to private property by our Constitution was not as large as it was contained in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United <ORG>s of America According to the learned Attorney General the true content of the fundamental right guaranteed by article was that a person could not be deprived of his property except by statutory authority but once a law was made depriving a person of his property then the article afforded no further protection There it was held that the freedoms relating to the person of a citizen guaranteed by article assume the existence of a free citizen and can no longer be enjoyed if a citizen is deprived of his liberty by the law of preventive or punitive detention In like manner it was argued that the freedom relating to property guaranteed by article also vanished as soon as a person was deprived of his property under a law enacted by an appropriate legislature The first exception was that the guarantee of freedom given by article could be defeated simply by enacting a statute and the second exception was that it could also be defeated by the <ORG> acquiring title in the property in exercise of its power of eminent domain within the limited field prescribed by article but that if a certain deprivation of property did not fail within the prescribed field of article and fell within article then for such deprivation no compensation was payable In my judgment none of these contentions have any validity It seems to me that our Constitution subject to certain exceptions has guaranteed the fullest protection to private property It has not only provided that no person can be deprived of property by the executive without legislative sanction but it has further provided that even the legislature cannot deprive a person of his property unless there is a public purpose and then only on payment of compensation No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property movable or immovable including any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given No such law as is referred to in clause made by <ORG> State shall have effect unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent If any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the legislature of a State has after it has been passed by such <ORG> been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent then notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause Nothing in clause shall affect a the provisions of any existing law other than a law to which the provisions of clause apply or the provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make i for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty or ii for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to life or property or iii in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the Government of the Dominion of India or the GoVernment of India and the Government of any other country or otherwise with respect to property declared by law to be evacuee property Any law of the State enacted not more than eighteen months before the commencement of this Constitution may within three months from such commencement be submitted to the President for his certification and thereupon if the President by public notification so certifies it shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause of this article or has contravened the provisions of sub section of section of the Government of India Act Not only are the protections given against deprecation of personal freedom mentioned in this group but it also mentions cases where personal freedom can be deprived by certain laws Under this scheme the fundamental right regarding property apart from personal and property freedoms has been dealt with in this part separately as a self contained provision and as a distinct subject from the various freedoms declared by article The true approach to this question is that these two articles really deal with two different subjects and one has no direct relation with the other namely article deals with the field of eminent domain and the whole boundary of that field is demarcated by this article In other words the <ORG> power to take the property of a person is comprehensively delimited by this article Legislative authority requisite The right to appropriate private property to public uses lies dormant in the <ORG> until legislative action is had pointing out the occasions the modes conditions and agencies for its appropriations Clause of the article places an additional limitation on <ORG> laws enacted on this subject while clause limits the justiciability of the quantum of compensation in certain cases As pointed out in Willis on Constitutional Law at page police power power of taxation and eminent domain are all forms of social control and probably include all the forms of social control known to the law but each differs from the others though it is possible to distinguish each from the others yet each has characteristics which resemble the characteristics of others and there are times when it is very difficult to draw a line between the one and the others Not only has it saved from the mischief of clause of article provisions of laws made for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty and the laws made for promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to life or property but it has also saved from the mischief of the clause the provisions of all existing laws which may be construed as amounting to deprivation of property of a person as well as evacuee property laws under which the <ORG> takes possession of properties of persons who have left India for Pakistan In the result the saving clause comprehensively includes within the ambit all the powers of the <ORG> in exercise of which it could deprive a person of property without payment of compensation From the language employed in the different sub clauses of article it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the words acquisition and taking possession used in article have the same meaning as the word deprivation in article I am unable to accede to this contention as it seems to me that the Constitution while defining and delimiting fundamental rights would not introduce in the articles dealing with those rights some matter merely by way of abundant caution As already said the article read as a whole comprehensively defines the <ORG> power of eminent domain as distinguished from all its other powers the exercise of which may amount to the taking of private property Only laws made for the promotion of public health or for prevention of danger to life or property have been excluded from the mischief of clause of the article while other laws made in exercise of power of social control which deprive a person of property have not been saved from the operation of clause In support of his contention that the content of article was larger than that of article and that except in cases where the form of taking private property took the shape of acquisition of title or requisition for <ORG> uses in all other cases the <ORG> could deprive a person of his property by simply making a law the learned Attorney General placed reliance on the following observations of my brother <NAME> in <NAME> case Article formulates the fundamental right in a negative form prohibiting the deprivation of property except by authority of law It implies that a person may be deprived of his property by authority of law Article prohibits the acquisition or taking possession of property for a public purpose under any law unless such law provides for payment of compensation This deprivation of property is different from acquisition or taking of possession of property which goes by the name of eminent domain in the American law I am not prepared to adopt such construction for I do not feel pressed to do so by the language used in article I think clause enunciates the general principle that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law which put in a positive form implies that a person may be deprived of his property provided he is so deprived by authority of law The effect of clause is that only certain kinds of deprivation of property namely those brought about by acquisition or taking possession of it will not be permissible under any law unless such law provides for payment of compensation Undoubtedly great weight must be given to the opinion expressed on this question by my learned brother and had I not felt convinced that his approach to this question was illiberal and restricted I would have hesitated to differ from his views This is the only clause in the article which gives protection to private property from being taken Under executive orders without legislative sanction behind them If the <ORG> had been entitled by clause to take away private property merely by making a law then no question of paying compensation would arise whether the taking assumed one form or another On this construction of clause of article the logical conclusion is that what has been done by this clause is that it has declared a fundamental right in the <ORG> as against an individual It seems that in that case pointed attention was not drawn during arguments to the comprehensive provisions of the saving clause of the article which seems fully to cover cases of that kind The contention of the learned Attorney General that on the analogy of the decision of this court in <NAME> case it should be held that when a person is deprived of private property by authority of law that deprivation puts an end to all the freedoms regarding property guaranteed under article does not require any detailed examination in the light of the construction placed by me on the language of article It was conceded by the learned counsel that that decision would have had no application once it was held that clauses and of article dealt with the same topic of compulsory acquisition of property As above pointed both these expressions used in clause convey the same meaning that is conveyed in clause by the expression deprivation As I read article it gives complete protection to private property as against executive action no matter by what process a In other words the Constitution declares that no person shall be deprived of possession of private property without payment of compensation and that too under the authority of law provided there was a public purpose behind that law The protection is against loss of property to the owner and there is no protection given to the <ORG> by the article It has no fundamental right as against the individual citizen Article states the limitations on the power of the <ORG> in the field of taking property and those limitations are in the interests of the person sought to be deprived of his property The question whether acquisition has a larger concept than is conveyed by the expression taking possession is really of academic interest in view of the comprehensive phraseology employed by clause of article As the matter was argued at some length I propose to briefly indicate my opinion on that point By virtue of the provisions of section placitum xxxi of the Constitution of Australia <ORG> is empowered to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any state or person for any purpose in respect of which the <ORG> has power to make laws General regulations styled as the National Security Regulations were made under the national Security Act section Regulation relates to the taking of possession of land by the <ORG> and other regulations provide for the ascertainment and payment of compensation for toss or damage suffered by reason of things done in pursuance of the regulation The fact that the <ORG> is in possession of land as a result of action under the Regulations does not show that the <ORG> has become the owner of the land or of any estate in the land requisition of land could not be considered as being included either in item or item of List II of the th Schedule of the Act that the word acquisition implied ownership in the property or rights in or over such property while requisition implied deprivation of the owner of the property for the time being of the use and possession thereof and meant control of the property and that there was no warrant for holding that so far as legislative practice in India was concerned requisition was included in acquisition Having considered the matter in full and with respect to the learned Judge I prefer to follow the view of the majority of the court because it seems to me that it is more in consonance with juridical principle that possession after all is nine tenths of ownership and once possession is taken away practically everything is taken away and that in construing the Constitution it is the substance and the practical result of the act of the <ORG> that should be considered rather than its purely legal aspect Reference was also made to certain observations of my brother <NAME> in <NAME> case in which the opinion was expressed that the word acquisition had implicit in it the idea of vesting of property in property in the State It was contended there that those provisions abridged the fundamental rights guaranteed by article of the Constitution In the light of these different decisions the Constitution employed more comprehensive phraseology in article than had been employed in the entries of the th Schedule appended to the Government of India Act and which became the subject matter of construction in the case decided by <NAME> In the entries of the th Schedule appended to the Constitution the word used is requisition but the same phraseology has not been employed purposely in clause of article in all On the finding that the company property was in effect taken possession of under the provisions of the Ordinance by the <ORG> and that the company was deprived of it there is no escape from the conclusion that the impugned Ordinance and the statute following it are void as both of them encroach on the fundamental right of the company under article of the Constitution It was then argued that even so the plaintiff in the suit was not entitled to the relief claimed by him as it was the company alone that could complain about the abridgement of its fundamental rights by the Ordinance in question But this decision in my opinion has no apposite application to the facts and circumstances of this case and is clearly distinguishable Inter alia <NAME> grievance was that his fundamental right under article of the Constitution had been infringed by the impugned law inasmuch as the <ORG> had taken possession of the company property and that all the rights and privileges annexed to his share had thereby been lost The majority of the court took the view that the petitioner was still in possession of his share and that he had power to dispose of that share that he could It was said that the complainant could not succeed because somebody else was hurt and that it was an elementary principle of law that in order to justify the grant of extraordinary relief the complainant need of it and the absence of an adequate remedy at law must clearly appear All the preference shareholders are represented in this suit including some of the directors the company has been impleaded as a defendant and the old directors of the company have made an application that they should be allowed tO support the appeal The plaintiff has every right to challenge the authority of the directors to make the call and to question their locus standi before they can fix a liability on him If that person claims in the status of an agent of some other person unless his appointment is validly made he would have no authority The directors appointed by the Government can only invoke in aid the authority given to them by the Ordinance and if the Ordinance is void as against the company they cannot be held to be directors of the company and would therefore have no authority to make the call In my judgment therefore it is plain that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed on the basis of the infringement of the company fundamental right under article because that is the only authority under which the directors have been brought into existence and are exercising powers by virtue of the provisions of the Ordinance The learned Attorney General drew our attention to a number of cases for the proposition that unless there was a direct infringement of the fundamental right of the shareholders it was not open to them to take advantage of the breach of a fundamental right of the company In my opinion the correct rule on this point has been stated in Willoughby at page on the authority of the decision in <NAME> Mellon and is in these terms We have no power per se to review and annul acts of <ORG> on the ground that they are unconstitutional The rule stated above has apposite application to this case He also made reference to the cases of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> A white man sold his property in such a block to a Negro under a contract which provided that the purchaser should not be required to accept a deed unless he would have a right under the laws of the city to occupy Although the alleged denial of constitutional rights involved only the rights of coloured persons and the vendor was a white person yet it was held that the vendor was directly affected because the courts below in view of the Ordinance declined to enforce his contract and thereby directly affected his right to sell his property That may very well have been the correct view in the case of a fully paid up shareholder who had no further liability or who was not likely to suffer in any manner by the enforcement of the Ordinance but the situation of a partly paid up preference shareholder as in this case is quite different and distinguishable and in my judgment the apposite rule to apply to the present case is the one laid down in the cases of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> WarIcy The result is that the plaintiff is entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the Ordinance on the basis that it abridges the company fundamental right under article In <NAME> case the question of his locus standi was left open by the Chief Justice In these circumstances it cannot be said that the decision given in <NAME> case is binding on this point as even the judgments of the Judges forming the majority did not speak with the same voice For the reasons given above I would allow this appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and decree the plaintiff suit with costs DAS I agree that this appeal should be allowed but I prefer tO rest my decision on the grounds and reasonings set forth in detail in my judgment in Appeal No This is an appeal by the plaintiff in a suit filed in <ORG> on behalf of himself and other preference shareholders of the respondent company praying for a declaration that the power given to the defendants respondents to who had been appointed directors under the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Emergency Provisions Ordinance II of hereinafter referred to as the said Ordinance to make a call and the resolution passed by the defendants respondents to on the th February for making a call of Rs had been paid up and consequently if the call has been duly made he will have to pay Rs The material facts leading up to the institution of the suit and the terms of the impugned Ordinance have been set out in detail in the judgments delivered by this court in the case of <NAME> <ORG> where this very Ordinance and the Act which replaced it were challenged The determination of the matters in issue depends on the correct interpretation of article read with article article and article of the Constitution My view about the correlation between article read with article and article and the true meaning and the respective scope and effect of clauses and of article have been set forth in detail in my judgment in <NAME> case and have been more fully explained in my judgment in Appeal No In the light of the conclusions reached and the reasons in support thereof given by me in those judgments I proceed to examine the contentions advanced by the appellant <NAME> now under consideration <NAME> expressed himself thus at page An incorporated company therefore can come up to this court for enforcement of its fundamental rights and so may be individual shareholders to enforce their own but it would not be open to an individual shareholder to complain of an Act which affects the fundamental rights of the company except to the extent that it constitutes an infraction of his own rights as well As the rights are different and inhere indifferent legal entities it is not competent to one person to seek to enforce the rights of another except where the law permits him to do so And again at page The rights that could be enforced under article must ordinarily be the rights of the petitioner himself who complains of infraction of such rights and approaches the court for relief At pages the learned Judge discussed the question whether the impugned law had infringed any fundamental right of the shareholders under article or article and answered it in the negative <NAME> at page referred to a passage in the judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> Atchison and expressly held that no one except those whose rights were directly affected by a law could raise the question of the constitutionality of the law His Lordship said The company and the shareholders are in law separate entities and if the allegation is made that any property belonging to the company has been taken possession of without compensation or the right enjoyed by the company under article has been infringed it would be for the company to come forward to assert or vindicate its own rights and not for any individual shareholder to do so Having thus decided the question arising under article he did not think it necessary to express any opinion on the questions raised under articles and At pages I dealt with the question whether the shareholder could impugn the constitutionality of the law on the ground that the fundamental right of the company had been infringed After referring to several decisions of <ORG> I came to the following conclusion at page In my opinion although a shareholder may in a sense be interested to see that the company of which he is a shareholder is not deprived of its property he cannot as held in <NAME> Indiana be heard to complain in his own name and on his own behalf of the infringement of the fundamental right to property of the company for in law his own right to property has not been infringed as he is not the owner of the company properties Even here the majority of the Bench took the view that the petitioner had not discharged the onus that was on him of showing that in fact there had been any discrimination against him and other shareholders of the company It is on the other hand contended on behalf of the appellant that the present case is distinguishable from <NAME> case in that the question here arises in a regular suit and not on an application under article for the enforcement of fundamental rights There was no such liability on the petitioner in <NAME> case for the was the holder of only one fully paid up ordinary share It is quite true as submitted by the learned Attorney General that the fact of the property of the company or the managing agents or the directors or the other persons having contracts with the company having been taken possession of by the <ORG> through the directors appointed by the <ORG> under the Ordinance has no relation to or bearing on the imposition on the preference shareholders of the liability to pay the call for the directors were not obliged to make the call because they had taken possession of the property of the company or the other persons and that this imposition of liabilityor risk cannot therefore be said to be the direct or even indirect result of the <ORG> having through the directors appointed under the Ordinance taken possession of the property of the company or the other persons It is then urged by him that that being so the preference shareholders cannot be allowed to complain of the infringment of the rights of the company or of the other persons which does not concern or affect them and scope of the suit filed by the appellant for himself and all other preference shareholders If he can with a view to destroy the locus standi of the persons who have made the call raise the question of the invalidity of the Ordinance on the grounds I have just mentioned I can see no valid reason why for the self same purpose he should not be permitted to challenge the validity of the Ordinance on the ground of its unconstitutionality for the breach of the fundamental rights of the company or of other persons In <NAME> case the petitioner was held to have suffered no loss of his own fundamental right as a shareholder and therefore by raising the question of unconstitutionality of the Ordinance on the ground of the breach of the fundamental rights of the company or of the other persons he was really fighting the battle of the company and the other persons and not of his own Here the law has made the imposition of a liability on him and other preference shareholders possible and he is seeking to resist that liability and as in the premises he is directly affected by the statute he has sufficient interest to challenge its validity If as between the company or the other persons and these persons who purporting to act as directors have made the call the law is unconstitutional for breach of the former fundamental rights then it follows that these persons are not in the eve of the law the directors of the company at all and if they are not in law the directors of the company surely they cannot arrogate to themselves the right to exercise any of the powers of the directors of the company and to make any call It is true that from a practical point of view it may be difficult for the shareholders if they desire to sell the shares to find a purchaser who will be willing to buy shares in a company which is governed by an Ordinance of this kind but nevertheless it cannot be said that the <ORG> has taken possession of the shares in the sense in which that expression used in article has been explained by me in <NAME> case There can be no doubt that there is force in this contention but as I have indicated at the outset we are not concerned in this case with the larger question as to how far the inter position of this statutory management and control amounts to taking possession of the property and assets belonging to the company In this view of the matter there is great force in the argument that the property of the company has been taken possession of by the State through directors who have been appointed by the State in exercise of the powers conferred by the Ordinance and the Act and who are under the direction and control of the State and this has been done without payment of any compensation in <ORG> Mahon concluded Here therefore it may well be argued that the property of the company having been taken possession of by the State in exercise of powers conferred by a law which does not provide for payment of any compensation the fundamental right of the company has in the eye of the law been infringed It is quite clear that although I used the words there is great force in the argument and it may well be argued the then inclination of my mind was definitely that the property of the company had been taken possession of as contemplated by article My observations were much more definite than those of <NAME> General contends that the taking of possession of the property of the company that has taken place in this case is clearly not an exercise of the power of eminent domain within article but constitutes an exercise of police power under article Here according to him the <ORG> has not taken possession of the company property on its own account to implement a public purpose such as is contemplated by article but the <ORG> has taken possession of the company property to prevent the company from using its own property to the detriment of the interests of the public and to do for the company what the company should itself have done There is no suggestion either in this long title or in the body of the Act except in section that the Act is intended only to be a temporary emergency measure There is no doubt that section of the Act provides that the property of the company and the management and administration of its affairs would be restored to the company or its directors elected by the shareholders but that is left entirely to the unfettered discretion of the Government It has far overstepped the limits of police power and is in substance nothing short of expropriation by way of the exercise of the power of eminent domain and as the law has not provided for any compensation it must be held to offend the provisions of article The majority of the Bench however took the view that there being a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the law and that the onus of displacing that presumption being on him who impugns the law the petitioner in that case had not discharged that onus and that therefore he could not complain of discrimination In the present case there is nothing more than what there was before the court in <NAME> case Indeed the question of discrimination does not appear to have been argued before the trial court and the appeal court has rejected it by saying that the plaintiff had not shown that there were other companies which were guilty of the same conduct but had not been similarly dealt with In my judgment therefore this appeal should be allowed and the plaintiff suit should be decreed But I prefer to rest my decision on simpler foundations We have to interpret the plain provisions of the Constitution and it is for jurists and students of law not for judges to see whether our Constitution also provides for these powers and it is for them to determine whether the shape which they take in India resemble any of the varying forms which they assume in other countries Article confers a certain fundamental certain freedom on all citizens of India namely the freedom to acquire bold and dispose of property The rights conferred by article are not unfettered and the State can impose restrictions provided they are I reasonable and are in the interests of either the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe They actually did acquire property and they held it and nobody stopped them Now an Act of the legislature is legal sanction therefore it the rest of the article was not there a man could be deprived of his property by legislative enactment though not by executive action It also includes any interest in any company owning any interest in any commercial or industrial undertaking He also has a direct interest in the undertaking that the company runs because as a preference shareholder he is a member of the company and would on liquidation be entitled to share in the distribution of its assets Next have these interests been taken possession of or acquired Here again I have no doubt Each case must depend on its own facts The plaintiff and the company have been left with the mere husk of title and not only has every form of enjoyment which normally accompanies an interest in this kind of property been taken away from them but to add insult to injury the plaintiff has also been called upon to pay substantial sums of money and for what not in compliance with any engagement into which he has entered not in fulfilment of any duty or obligation which he has incurred not in furtherance of his interests of which he is the best judge but blankly and unashamedly because the furtherance of his interests affects the production of an essential commodity and has caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community They have the right when the law so permits it to take over this responsibility when the public interests so demand but if by doing so they deprive private individuals and non statutory bodies their interests in property in the sense explained above they must pay compensation My brother <NAME> has dealt with this at length and there is no need for me to add to what he has said I would therefore also in agreement with my learned brother allow the appeal and decree the plaintiff claim with costs <NAME> have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of my learned brother Mr Justice <NAME> and I agree with his conclusion that the appeal should be allowed and the plaintiff suit decreed with costs I would like to add a few words This appeal raises the question of the constitutional validity of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Emergency Provisions Ordinance II of subsequently replaced by Act XXVIII of which reproduced substantially the same provisions The minority declared the impugned Act as void as it violated the fundamental rights of the petitioner under article of the Constitution The question which we are now invited to consider was raised by the appellant a preference shareholder holding preference shares of the face value of Rs Thereupon he filed the suit in a representative capacity on behalf of himself and other preference shareholders challenging the validity of the Act The suit was dismissed by the trial Judge whose decision was affirmed on appeal by <ORG> of <ORG> My learned brother has analysed in detail the relevant provisions of the impugned Act and I have no hesitation in agreeing with him that the Act in substance robs the company of every vestige of right except what has been laconically called the husk of title Article finds a place in Part III of the Constitution which deals with fundamental rights Upon a simple and straightforward construction of its language and the context in which it stands and unhampered by the provisions of the American Constitution the article confers upon every person whether a citizen or not a fundamental right of protection of property against encroachment by the executive without the authority of law and against the legislature unless the law passed by it satisfies the two essential conditions Article in my opinion is wider than article which confers upon a citizen only the right to acquire hold and dispose of property and is different in scope and content Having regard to the setting in which article is placed the word property used in the article must be construed in the widest sense as con noting a bundle of rights exercisable by the owner in respect thereof and embracing within its purview both corporeal and incorporeal rights The word property is not defined in the Constitution and there is no good reason to restrict its meaning The result is that I agree with the order proposed by my learned brother
