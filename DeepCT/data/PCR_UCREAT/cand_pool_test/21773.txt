HEADNOTE Under the terms of a mining lease the lessee worked the mines and won iron ore in a tract of land in a village in Chittor district and bound himself to pay a dead rent if he used the leased land for the extraction of iron ore to pay a royalty on iron ore if it were used for extraction of iron and in addition to pay a surface rent in respect of the surface area occupied or used On March two notices were issued to the appellant demanding payment of cess for the years and respectively and threatening coercive proceedings for their recovery in the event of non compliance Impugning the validity of the earlier notices of demand the appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> and a similar petition challenging the validity of the notice of demand for the later period Pending these petitions a further notice of demand for payment of cess for the years was served on the appellant in August and to obtain a similar relief in respect of this notice and the proceedings for recovery thereof the appellant filed a writ petition in this Court and contended that the expression royalty under does not signify royalty as commonly understood but is confined to the rent payable for the beneficial use of the surface of the land assuming that royalty in the sense mentioned in point No is within ss and of the Act the provision imposing the land cess quad royalty under the mining leases must be held to be repealed by the Central Act of and is the land cess demanded by the impugned notices dated March and August recoverable as an arrears of land revenue under the law of the Act which made the provision for the recovery of sums due as taxes had by reason of the changes effected in the rules ceased to be applicable to the recovery of land cess under Held i Where the land is held on lease as in the present case the lease amount is specifically ref erred to in of the Act as one of the components for the computation of the annual rent value ii There is no connection between the regulation and development of mines and minerals dealt with in the Central Act and the levy and collection of land cess under ss and of the Act There is therefore nothing in common between the Act and the Central Act of and so as to require any detailed examination of the enactments for discovering whether there is any overlapping Where the land is held under lease it is the lease amount that forms the basis Where land is held under a mining lease that which the occupier is willing to pay is accordingly treated as the annual rent value of the property such rent value would therefore necessarily include not merely the surface rent but the dead rent as well as the royalty payable by the licensee lessee or occupier for the user of the property The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The two Civil Appeals and the Petition under Art per acre per annum in respect of the surface area occupied or used On March two notices were issued to the appellant demanding the payment of the sums specified therein as being the messes for the years to and to respectively and threatening coercive proceedings for their recovery in the event of the demand not being complied with Impugning the validity of the notices of demand for the earlier triennial the appellant filed writ petition of in <ORG> of Andhra Pradesh and a similar petition No of challenging the validity of the notice of demand for the later period While these petitions were pending before <ORG> a further notice of demand claiming the pay ment of cess for the years and was served on the appellant in August and to obtain a similar relief in respect of this notice and the proceedings for the recovery thereof the appellant has filed writ petition of in this Court The appellant thereupon moved this court for special leave in respect of the dismissal of his writ petition of and the same having been granted all these three matters have been heard together Mr <NAME> counsel for the appellant raised three points in support of the appeal What is the meaning of the expression royalty in of the Art Does it include the royalty payable under a mining lease on the ore won by the lessee Assuming that royalty in the sense mentioned in point No is within ss and of the Act the provision imposing the land cess quoad royalty under mining leases must be held to be repealed by the Mines so that after the date when these Central enactments came into force the land cess that could be levied under must be exclusive of royalty under a mining lease Is the land cess which was demanded by the impugned notices dated March and August recoverable as an arrear of land revenue under the law We shall examine these submissions in that order Where the land is held on lease as in the present case the lease amount is specifically referred to in of the Act as one of the components for the computation of the annual rent value and there was a direction by this Court that the present appeals and petition might be heard after the judgment was pronounced in the Orissa appeals In <ORG> case the decision rendered an writ petitions filed in this court under Art One of the points urged in support of the petition was that on the enactment of the Minoan Minerals Regulation and Development Act Central Act LIII of the Orissa Act stood repealed and the cess leviable under its provisions was not thereafter capable of A I This Court on a detailed comparison of the provisions of the Orissa Act and the Central Act of came to the conclusion that the Central Act covered the same field as the Orissa enactment An examination of the scheme of the Orissa Act disclosed that it had been passed for the purpose of the development of mining areas in the State and this was affected by constituting mining areas and making provision for the development of such areas by improving communications by the construction of roads by providing means of transport supply of water electricity and other amenities for sanitation as also for the education of the labour force to attract workmen to these mining areas The Orissa State enactment had been passed in pursuance of the legislative power conferred by Entry of the State List in the th Schedule reading Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> The provision in List I referred to here is Entry in the Union List reading Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by law made by <ORG> to be expedient in public interest It was argued on behalf of the <ORG> that the Central Act of though it contained a declaration that the Regulation and Development of mines and mineral development was expedient in the public interest still such a declaration was not by <ORG> as required by Entry No but by the Dominion legislature and could not on the terms of item of List II affect the <ORG> power of legislation The Central Act also contained a declaration that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided This Court held that having regard to the comprehensive provisions contained in the several sections of the Act which were examined the extent provided included those which fell within the scope of the <ORG> Act of Orissa which was as stated earlier for the regulation and development of mining areas within the <ORG> It will be seen that there is no resemblance whatever between the provisions of the Orissa Act considered in the two decisions and the provision for the levy of the land cess under ss and of the Act with which we are concerned Sections and have nothing to do and are not concerned with the development of mines and minerals or their regulation The proceeds of the land cess are under of the Act to be credited to the District fund into which under the terms of the Finance Rules in Sch This fund is to be used under Ch VII of the Act with which starts for everything necessary for or conducive to the safety health convenience or education of the inhabitants or the amenities of the local area concerned and everything incidental to the administration and include in particular the several matters which are mentioned in those sections It will thus be seen that there is no connection between the regulation A I There is therefore no scope at all for the argument that there is anything in common between the Act and the Central Act of and so as to require any detailed examination of these enactments for discovering whether there is any over lapping It was next urged that the land cess was really a tax on mineral rights falling within Entry of the State List reading Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitation imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development and that the Central Act under which also taxes and fees might be levied brought into play the last portion of this Entry and that as a result the power to impose this tax was not available after the Central Act of and came into force No doubt in a sense but in a very remote sense it has relationship to mining as also to the mineral won from the mine under a contract by which royalty is payable on the quantity of mineral extracted But that does not stamp it as a tax on either the extraction of the mineral or on the mineral right It is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to examine the question as to what exactly is a tax on mineral rights seeing that such a tax is not leviable by <ORG> but only by the <ORG> and the sole limitation on the <ORG> power to levy the tax is that it must not interfere with a law made by <ORG> as regards mineral development Our attention was not invited to the provision of any such law enacted by <ORG> Under of the Act the cess is levied on occupied land on whatever tenure held This being the basis of the tax and disclosing its true nature provides for the manner in which the annual rent value is determined i what is the amount for which the land could reasonably be let the benefit to the lessor representing the ratable value or the annual rent value In the case of ryotwari lands it is the assessment which is payable to the <ORG> that is taken as the rental value being the benefit that accrues to the <ORG> Where the land is held under lease it is the lease amount that forms the basis Where land is held under a mining lease that which the occupier is willing to pay is accordingly treated as the annual rent value of the property Such a rent value would therefore necessarily include not merely the surface rent but the dead rent as well as the royalty payable by the licensee lessee or occupier for the user of the property The position then is that the rent which a tenant might be expected to pay for the property is in the case of lease hold interests treated as the statutory annual rent value It is therefore not possible to accept the contention that the fact that the lessee or licensee pays a royalty on the mineral won which is in excess of what he would pay if his right over the land extended only to the mere use of the surface land places it in a category different from other types where the lessee uses the surface of the land alone In each case the rent which a lessee or licensee actually pays for the land being the test it is manifest that the land cess is nothing else except a land tax
