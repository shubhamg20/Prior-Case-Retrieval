HEADNOTE The appellant was assessed to sales tax and the order of assessment was challenged by a writ petition in <ORG> Thereupon he filed another writ petition in <ORG> raising those additional contentions and challenging the order of assessment for the same year The Judgement of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The short question which this appeal raises for our decision is whether the principle of constructive res judicata can be invoked against a writ petition filed by the appellant <NAME> who is the Proprietor of He challenged the validity of the said order of assessment by a writ petition filed by him No <ORG> dismissed his writ petition and by special leave the appellant came to this Court in appeal against the said decision of <ORG> Thereafter the appellant filed the present writ petition in the same <ORG> on the rd April No By this writ petition the appellant challenges the validity of the same order of assessment In the result this second writ petition filed by the appellant has been dismissed by <ORG> on the th April It is against this decision that the appellant has come to this Court by special leave and that raises the question as to whether it is open to the appellant to challenge the validity of the same order of assessment twice by two consecutive writ petitions under Art It was on the st December that a notice was issued to the appellant by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax under the Act The other contention raised by the appellant against the validity of the said order was that it was in respect of sales which had been assessed earlier under the Act of and the same could not be reassessed under the subsequent Act Both these contentions were rejected by this Court with the result that the appeal preferred by the appellant was dismissed with costs It appears that at the hearing of the appeal before this <ORG> Mr <NAME> for the appellant sought to raise two additional points but he was not permitted to do so on the ground that they had not been specified in the writ petition filed before <ORG> and had not been raised at an earlier stage Since this <ORG> had refused permission to Mr <NAME> to raise these two additional grounds it was observed in the course of the judgment that the <ORG> did not express any opinion as to their tenability on the merits That is how the question which arises for our decision is is it permissible to the appellant to attack the validity of the same order imposing a sales tax and penalty on him for the year by two consecutive writ petitions In other words is the principle of constructive res judicata applicable to writ petitions of this kind or not Mr <NAME> for the appellant has strenuously contended that where a citizen seeks for redress from <ORG> by invoking its high prerogative jurisdiction under Art There can be no doubt that the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens are a significant feature of our Constitution and <ORG>s under Art One important consideration of public policy is that the decisions pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction should be final unless they are modified or reversed by appellate authorities and the other principle is that no one should be made to face the same kind of litigation twice over because such a process would be contrary to considerations of fair play and justice vide <NAME> and Others <ORG> Even if the said orders are passed under the same provisions of law it may theoretically be open to the party to contend that the liability being recurring from year to year the cause of action is not the same and so even if a citizen petition challenging the order of assessment passed against him for one year is rejected it may be open to him to challenge a similar assessment order passed for the next year In that case the court may ultimately adopt the same view which had been adopted on the earlier occasion but if a new ground is urged the court may have to consider it on the merits because strictly speaking the principle of res judicata may not apply to such a case In that case this <ORG> had occasion to consider the question about the applicability of constructive res judicata to proceedings taken by the appellant <ORG> challenging the tax levied against it for different periods Mr <NAME> contends that in dealing with writ petitions no distinction should be made between cases where the impugned order of assessment is in respect of the same year or for different years and in support of this contention he relied on the general observations made by this <ORG> in The <ORG> case As we have already mentioned though the courts dealing with the questions of the infringement of fundamental rights must consistently endeavor to sustain the said rights and should strike down their unconstitutional invasion it would not be right to ignore the principle of res judicata altogether in dealing with writ petitions filed by citizens alleging the contravention of their fundamental rights Considerations of public policy cannot be ignored in such cases and the basic doctrine that judgments pronounced by this <ORG> are binding and must be regarded as final between the parties in respect of matters covered by them must receive due consideration In case <ORG> had upheld these contentions and had given effect to its decision its order would have been plainly inconsistent with the earlier decision of this <ORG> and that would be inconsistent with the finality which must attach to the decisions of this <ORG> as between the parties before it in respect of the subject matter directly covered by the said decision When leave was refused to him by this <ORG> to take those points in appeal he filed a new petition in <ORG> and took those points and finding that <ORG> had decided against him on the merits of those points he has come to this <ORG> but that is not all At the hearing of this appeal he has filed another petition asking for leave from this <ORG> to take some more additional points and that shows that if constructive res judicata is not applied to such proceedings a party can file as many writ petitions as he likes and take one or two points every time We are therefore satisfied that the second writ petition filed by the appellant in the present case is barred by constructive res judicata
