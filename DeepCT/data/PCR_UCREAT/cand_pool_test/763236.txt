The principle of promissory estoppel has full application to the facts of the case The <ORG> has tried to seek shelter under a set of rules framed by it in exercise of the powers vested under section of the Electricity Supply Act of The records clearly show i the <ORG> did represent to the trainee engineers from time to time that after their training was completed they would be absorbed in regular employment of the <ORG> when some of the engineers were getting age barred for <ORG> employment and had left the <ORG> they were told to come back under the temptation of getting permanently employed under the <ORG> when the <ORG> was reeling a strike of its employees these trainee engineers had stood by the <ORG> to keep up the generation and distribution of electricity and had been assured of absorption and the <ORG> had decided to absorb them on permanent basis but initially on a probation of two years without conducting any further examination As the <ORG> did not give effect to its representations and decisions the graduate engineers employed as Assistant Engineers or Junior Engineers started agitating for implementation of the <ORG> decisions from time to time Ultimately on March at a high level meeting where the Speaker of <ORG> presided the Chief Minister was present and among others participating in the meeting were the Commissioner of Irrigation and Electricity the Chairman of the <ORG> and the Secretary of Irrigation and Electricity it was decided After completion of one years training which is October as decided by the <ORG> they will be appointed in the post of Assistant Electrical Engineer and Junior Electrical Engineer on provisional regular basis These appeals directed against the decision of <ORG> A few important aspects emerge from the record the <ORG> did represent to the trainee engineers from time to time after their training was completed they would be absorbed in regular employment of the <ORG> when some of the engineers were getting age barred for Government employment and had left the <ORG> they were told to come back under the temptation of getting permanently employed under the <ORG> when the <ORG> was reeling under a strike of its employees these trainee engineers had stood by the <ORG> to keep up the generation and distribution of electricity and had been assured of absorption and the <ORG> had decided to absorb them on permanent basis but initially on a probation of two years without conducting any further examination The proceeding inter alia stated It was decided that after completion of one year training which is October as decided by the Board they will be appointed in the posts of Assistant Electrical Engineers and Junior Electrical Engineers on provisional basis It is also decided that the benefit of regular appointment is being given to the trainees under special circumstances which will not be an example for the future and when either under the Apprenticeship Act or under any other scheme anyone is taken as apprentice he will be discontinued after the period of apprenticeship We have referred to these two documents out of several of them available on the record to show that the <ORG> was aware of the position that these trainee engineers formed a special class and very peculiar circumstances warranted a definitely special treatment in regard to them Yet it is unfortunate that a statutory body like the <ORG> has failed to stand up to its representations made from time to time to a group of engineers who had spent years of their valuable life for qualifying themselves as engineers and who believing the representation of the <ORG> and acting upon the same continued to remain in the employment of the <ORG> as trainee engineers foregoing opportunities available to seek other employments and in the process have become age barred for any public employment Courts must do justice by the promotion of honesty and good faith as far as it lies in their power where it was said Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations of facts and promises made by them relying on which other persons have altered their position to their prejudice The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contractu by a person who acts upon the promise when the law requires that contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain form or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute the obligation may be if the contract to be not in that form enforced against it in appropriate cases in equity This Court added a pithy observation If our nascent democracy is to thrive different standards of conduct for the people and the public bodies cannot be permitted A public body is in our judgment not exempt from liability to carry out its obligations arising out of representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his prejudice this Court went ahead to state that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not really based on the principle of estoppel but it is a doctrine evolved by equity in order to prevent injustice and it can be the basis of cause of action In our view the principle relied upon in these cases has full application to the facts before us The <ORG> has tried to seek shelter under a set of rules framed by it in exercise of the powers vested under section of the Electricity Supply Act of But it appears that several engineers have also been recruited either on permanent or temporary basis against regular vacancies and they are not parties to these appeals In this view of the matter after the hearing was over we issued a mandamus to the <ORG> to offer regular appointment to the appellants within three months from that day i May in the appropriate cadre of Assistant Engineer or Junior Engineer as the case may be and such appointments were to be on probation for a period of two years as required under the rules The appeals are allowed and the judgment of <ORG> is reversed and the <ORG> is directed to give effect to the directions indicated above within the specified time The appellants shall have their costs throughout
