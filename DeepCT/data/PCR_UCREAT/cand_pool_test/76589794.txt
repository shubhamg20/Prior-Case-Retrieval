Respondents Advocates who appeared in this case For the Appellant Mr <NAME> with Mr <NAME> For the Respondents Mr <NAME> Sr Advocate with Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> HON BLE MR JUSTICE <NAME> HON BLE MS JUSTICE <NAME> Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment Yes This appeal is directed against the judgment and or order dated passed by a learned single Judge of this court in IA Nos and in CS OS The suit had been filed by the appellant against her husband Mr <NAME> defendant No her father in law Mr <NAME> defendant No since deceased and her mother in law Mrs <NAME> defendant No In the said suit the appellant plaintiff had sought the following reliefs a Grant a decree of permanent injunction restraining the Defendant Nos and from committing themselves or through their agents representatives acts of violence and intimidation against the plaintiff Grant a decree of permanent injunction restraining the Defendant Nos and and their agents representatives from forcibly dispossessing the Plaintiff out of her matrimonial home without due process of law Grant any other further relief relief as may be deemed fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the case It is her case that she was occupying the first floor of the said property and there was imminent danger of her being dispossessed from the said portion of the said property without following the due process of law The said applications were dismissed by the learned single Judge by virtue of the impugned order dated The learned single Judge was of the view that the plaintiff could not claim any right to stay in the said property as it did not belong to her husband defendant No but it belonged to her parents in law The learned single Judge in paragraph of the impugned judgment and or order observed as under There is no dispute that the suit property belongs to the defendant Nos and The learned single Judge it is obvious from the aforesaid extracts proceeded on the basis that the said property belonged to defendant Nos and that is the father in law and the mother in law and that there was no dispute with this proposition The learned single Judge also noted that there was a serious dispute as to whether the property could at all be termed as a matrimonial home There is also an allegation that the defendant No married another lady sometime in and that she had moved into the said property It is because of these circumstances that the learned single Judge was of the view that there was a serious dispute as to whether the suit property could at all have been termed as a matrimonial house particularly when the appellant plaintiff had left the said property in the early part of and had prima facie forcibly entered the same on Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff raised three points of attack insofar as the impugned decision is concerned His first and main point was that the learned single Judge had proceeded on the basis that there was no dispute that the property belonged to the defendants and He submitted that the plaintiff appellant had a right of residence and that this proposition was not correct Elaborating on the first aspect of the matter that the appellant plaintiff had not admitted the defendant Nos and jointly or the defendant No by herself to be the exclusive owner of the said property Mr <NAME> drew our attention to the pleadings of the parties and in particular to the written statements filed on behalf of the defendant Nos and However in paragraph of the same written statement a somewhat different statement has been made to the following effect The suit property lawfully belongs to the parents of the defendant No and the plaintiff has no claim whatsoever in the said suit property At one point they claim that the property belongs to the defendant Nos and and at other points they claim that the property belongs to defendant No exclusively It was therefore contended by Mr <NAME> that there was a dispute with regard to the ownership of the suit property There was also some controversy with regard to a status quo order dated But we need not go into that aspect of the matter The main thrust of the arguments advanced by Mr <NAME> was that the foundation on which the learned single Judge had premised his conclusions was itself faulty inasmuch as the learned single Judge assumed that there was no dispute that the suit property belonged to the defendants and in which the appellant plaintiff husband had no share or interest He submitted that he has been able to show prima faice that there was a dispute as to whether the defendants and or the defendant No alone was the exclusive owner of the said property and that the issue as to whether it was a joint family property also needed to be looked into He submitted that one of the reliefs claimed in the suit was to permanently injunct the defendants from forcibly dispossessing the plaintiff out of her matrimonial home without due process of law However statement of defendant No was recorded by the <ORG> under Order CPC where he stated that he or his wife had no intention to throw her out of the premises in question without due process of law Mr <NAME> fully supported the impugned judgment and contended that there was no infirmity in the same and therefore did not call for any interference He submitted that the case of the appellant plaintiff was that there was no abandonment of the matrimonial home and that she had a right to live in the matrimonial home even if it belonged to her in laws Mr <NAME> also referred to a decision of a learned single Judge of this court in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Others DRJ by way of persuasive value to submit that under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act there is no concept of matrimonial home In that case the learned single Judge after referring to and relying upon the decision of the <ORG> in <NAME> supra held that a daughter in law has no right to live in the house belonging to her parents in law Secondly the appellant plaintiff resided in Dehradun and thirdly she resided in Mumbai and then in she once again left the said property only to re enter the same on at a He referred to the order CPC statement of the appellant plaintiff wherein she stated that she had married the defendant on and that she had shifted to Defence Colony in June and remained there till March According to Mr <NAME> the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act would come into play only when domestic violence takes place Let us first deal with the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the foundation of the learned single Judge decision that there was no dispute that the suit property belongs to defendant Nos and was itself faulty and therefore the entire decision is liable to be set aside It is true that the learned single Judge had proceeded on the basis that there was no dispute that the suit property belonged to defendants and and even the question which was taken up for prima facie consideration by the learned single Judge as would be apparent from paragraph of the impugned order was founded on the understanding that the appellant husband defendant No had no right title or share in the said property and that the said property belonged to the appellant father in law and mother in law He had also pointed out that there is no admission by the appellant plaintiff that her husband defendant No did not have any right interest or share in the said property The learned counsel for the appellant had drawn our attention to the written statements filed by the defendants as also the replication filed by the appellant plaintiff and the Order CPC statement of the defendant No However in the very same written statement the defendant No had also stated that the said property belonged to defendant Nos and and that it was their self acquired property In the very same paragraph para of the written statement of the defendant No it is again stated that no person except the defendant No has any right in the said property There is only some lack of clarity in the pleadings with regard to the exclusivity of ownership of the defendant No In other words there is a degree of ambiguity particularly on the part of defendant No as to whether the defendant No is the sole and exclusive owner of the said property or whether it also belongs to the defendant No However there is no confusion with regard to the stand that the said property does not at all belong to the appellant husband defendant No In any event the plea of joint ancestral property has been sought to be introduced only by way of an amendment to the plaint after the defendants had filed their written statements In para of the plaint it is merely stated that the property bearing No A Ring Road Lajpat Nagar IV is the matrimonial home of the plaintiff since and that she is currently residing in the first floor of the said property and the defendants are living on the ground floor due to strained relations between the parties Two things are clear from the averments made in the plaint The first is that it is nowhere alleged in the plaint by the appellant plaintiff that the said property which the appellant plaintiff was referring to as her matrimonial home belonged to or was owned by her husband defendant No In fact there is no averment in the plaint that the defendant No had any right title or interest or share in the said property There is no averment that the property did not belong to the defendant No exclusively Thus looking at the totality of the circumstances and the pleadings as well as the order <ORG> statements it cannot be said that the learned single Judge was off the mark when he observed that there is no dispute that the suit property belongs to the defendant Nos and In order to examine the other points urged by the learned counsel for the appellant to the effect that the conclusion of the learned single Judge that the appellant plaintiff could not claim any right in the property of the mother in law was erroneous and that the learned single Judge in so holding had virtually dismissed the suit itself without recording any satisfaction on the facts it would be necessary for us to consider the decisions cited at the bar as also the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act hereinafter referred to as the said Act We shall first examine the decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra wherein a question arose as to whether the right of maintenance of a Hindu lady includes the right of provision for residence In <NAME> supra in the context of a deserted wife continuing in possession of a property in which her husband was a tenant <ORG> observed that there was no precedent much less a binding authority from any court in India dealing with such a situation She has as much right as he to stay there even though the house does stand in his name In our opinion a deserted wife who has been or is entitled to be in occupation of the matrimonial home is entitled to contest the suit for eviction filed against her husband in his capacity as tenant subject to satisfying two conditions first that the tenant has given up the contest or is not interested in contesting the suit and such giving up by the tenant husband shall prejudice the deserted wife who is residing in the premises and secondly the scope and ambit of the contest or defence by the wife would not be on a footing higher or larger than that of the tenant himself <NAME> married <NAME> and started living with him in the second floor of the house belonging to <NAME> mother It was not disputed that the said house at Ashok Vihar Phase I Delhi belonged to <NAME> mother in law and not to her husband <NAME> She alleged that later on when she tried to enter Ashok Vihar she found the main entrance locked and consequently she filed a suit for mandatory injunction to enable her to enter the house However before any order could be passed in the said suit Smt <NAME> alongwith her parents allegedly broke open the locks and entered the said property In the said suit the trial Judge granted temporary injunction restraining the appellants therein from interfering with the possession of Smt <NAME> in respect of the second floor of the said property In appeal the Senior Civil Judge Delhi by his order dated held that Smt <NAME> was not residing in the second floor of the premises in question and that her husband <NAME> was not living in the said property and the matrimonial home could not be said to be a place where only a wife was residing Thereafter a petition under Article of the Constitution of India was filed before <ORG> whereupon a learned single Judge of this court held that the second floor of the property in question was the matrimonial home of Smt <NAME> and he further held that even if her husband <NAME> shifted to Ghaziabad that would not make the Ghaziabad home the matrimonial home of Smt <NAME> <ORG> disagreed with the view taken by the learned single Judge of this court A reference was made to the following observations in Mehta supra it may be that with change of situation and complex problems arising it is high time to give the wife or the husband a right of occupation in a truly matrimonial home in case of the marriage breaking up or in case of strained relationship between the husband and the wife FAO OS Page of However <ORG> in <NAME> supra observed that the aforesaid extract was merely an expression of hope and it did not lay down any law and that it was only the legislature which could create a law and not the court There is no such law in India like the British Matrimonial Homes Act and in any case the rights which may be available under any law can only be as against the husband and not against the father in law or mother in law Here the house in question belongs to the mother in law of Smt <NAME> and it does not belong to her husband <NAME> <NAME> cannot claim any right to live in the said house <NAME> has stated that she had taken a loan for acquiring the house and it is not a joint family property We see no reason to disbelieve this statement If the aforesaid submission is accepted then it will mean that wherever the husband and wife lived together in the past that property becomes a shared household It is quite possible that the husband and wife may have lived together in dozens of places with the husband father husband paternal grand parents his maternal parents uncles aunts brothers sisters nephews nieces etc If the interpretation canvassed by the learned Counsel for the respondent is accepted all these houses of the husband relatives will be shared households and the wife can well insist in living in the all these houses of her husband relatives merely because she had stayed with her husband for some time in those houses in the past Such a view would lead to chaos and would be absurd It is well settled that any interpretation which leads to absurdity should not be accepted As regards Section of the Act in our opinion the wife is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household and a shared household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member The property in question in the present case neither belongs to <NAME> nor was it taken on rent by him nor is it a joint family property of which the husband <NAME> is a member it is the exclusive property of appellant No mother of <NAME> Hence it cannot be called a shared household No doubt the definition of shared household in Section of the Act is not very happily worded and appears to be the result of clumsy drafting but we have to give it an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society Insofar as Section of the said Act is concerned a wife would only be entitled to claim a right of residence in a shared household and such a household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member In the light of the aforesaid principles the appellant plaintiff would certainly have a right of residence whether as a part of maintenance or as a separate right under the said Act The said Act was introduced inter alia to provide for the rights of women to secure housing and to provide for the right of the women to reside in a shared household whether or not she had any right title or interest in such a household Let us now look at the relevant provisions of the said Act In this Act unless the context otherwise requires a aggrieved person means any woman who is or has been in a domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to have been subjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx respondent means any adult male person who is or has been in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved person and against whom the aggrieved person has sought any relief under this Act Provided that an aggrieved wife or female living in a relationship in the nature of a marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the husband or the male partner xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx shared household means a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the respondent and includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right title interest or equity and includes such a household which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right title or interest in the shared household Section relates to the right to reside in a shared household Section prescribes the protection orders which the Magistrate may pass on being prima facie satisfied that domestic violence has taken place or is likely to take place Section contemplates the residence orders that may be passed by the Magistrate on being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place Right to reside in a shared household Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force every woman in a domestic relationship shall have the right to reside in the shared household whether or not she has any right title or beneficial interest in the same The aggrieved person shall not be evicted or excluded from the shared household or any part of it by the respondent save in accordance with the procedure established by law The Magistrate may after giving the aggrieved person and the respondent an opportunity of being heard and on being prima facie satisfied that domestic violence has taken place or is likely to take place pass a protection order in favour of the aggrieved person and prohibit the respondent from a committing any act of domestic violence aiding or abetting in the commission of acts of domestic violence entering the place of employment of the aggrieved person or if the person aggrieved is a child its school or any other place frequented by the aggrieved person attempting to communicate in any form whatsoever with the aggrieved person including personal oral or written or electronic or telephonic contact alienating any assets operating bank lockers or bank accounts used or held or enjoyed by both the parties jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent or singly by the respondent including her stridhan or any other property held either jointly by the parties or separately by them without the leave of the Magistrate causing violence to the dependants other relatives or any person who give the aggrieved person assistance from domestic violence committing any other act as specified in the protection order While disposing of an application under sub section of section the Magistrate may on being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place pass a residence order a restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any other manner disturbing the possession of the aggrieved person from the shared household whether or not the respondent has a legal or equitable interest in the shared household directing the respondent to remove himself from the shared household restraining the respondent or any of his relatives from entering any portion of the shared household in which the aggrieved person resides restraining the respondent from alienating or disposing off the shared household or encumbering the same restraining the respondent from renouncing his rights in the shared household except with the leave of the Magistrate or directing the respondent to secure same level of alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared household or to pay rent for the same if the circumstances so require Provided that no order under clause shall be passed against any person who is a woman The Magistrate may impose any additional conditions or pass any other direction which he may deem reasonably necessary to protect or to provide for the safety of the aggrieved person or any child of such aggrieved person While passing an order under sub section sub section or sub section the court may also pass an order directing the officer in charge of the nearest police station to give protection to the aggrieved person or to assist her or the person making an application on her behalf in the implementation of the order Another important provision is Section which empowers the Magistrate to grant interim and ex parte orders on the Magistrate being satisfied that an application prima facie discloses that the respondent is committing or has committed an act of domestic violence or that there is a likelihood that the respondent may commit an act of domestic violence The ex parte order may be passed on the basis of affidavits of the aggrieved person in terms of inter alia Sections and against the respondent Shared household is defined in Section to mean a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the respondent and includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right title interest or equity The shared household also includes such a household which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right title or interest in the shared household In contrast the impression that we get by reading Section which defines shared household is that the household which is referred to in the said provision relates to the property and not just to the group of people who dwell under the same roof or the family living together Therefore we are of the view that the word household used in Section actually means a house in the normal sense of referring to a property be it a full fledged house or an apartment or some other property by any other description It also refers to a property whether owned or tenanted or in which the aggrieved person or the respondent has any right title interest or equity It also includes such a property whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either of them or both jointly or singly have any right title interest or equity It also includes a property which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right title or interest therein <ORG> has already observed in Batra supra that the definition of shared household in Section is not happily worded but the courts have to give it an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society In this backdrop and in the facts and circumstances of the present case the property in question cannot be considered to be a shared household because neither the appellant plaintiff nor her husband defendant No has any right title or interest or equitable right in the same Section of the said Act deals with the right of every women in a domestic relationship to reside in the shared household and Section specifically provides that such a woman shall not be evicted or excluded from the shared household or any part of it by the respondent save in accordance with the procedure established by law In other words the wife can be evicted or excluded from the shared household after following the due procedure established by law and it is not an absolute right of the wife to reside in a shared household The residence orders that may be passed under Section are also subject to the Magistrate court being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place We feel that in view of the prima facie finding that the property in question does not belong to the appellant plaintiff husband nor does he have any share or interest in the same there is no question of the said property being regarded as a shared household in terms of Section of the said Act There is no doubt that the appellant plaintiff has a right of a residence whether as an independent right or as a right encapsulated in the right to maintenance under the personal law applicable to her In order to illustrate this proposition we may take an example of a house being allotted to a high functionary say a Minister in <ORG> and who resides in the same house alongwith his wife son and daughter in law Can the daughter in law claim that she has a right to live in that particular property irrespective of the fact that the father in law subsequently is no longer a Minister and the property reverts entirely to the <ORG> Certainly not The parties shall bear their respective costs
