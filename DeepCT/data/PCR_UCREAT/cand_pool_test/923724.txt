HEADNOTE The respondents who were manufacturers of Vegetable products known as Vanaspati were assessed to excise duty under item of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act on what the taxing authorities called the manufacture of refind oil from raw oil Which according to them fell within the description of vegetable non essential oils all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power The common case made by the respondents in their petition under Art of the Constitution challenging the imposition was that for the purpose of manufacturing Vanaspati they purchased groundnut and til oil from the market and subjected them to different processed before applying hydrogenation to produce Vanaspati and that nothing that they produced at any stage was covered by that item Affidavits by experts were filed by both the parties and <ORG> found in favour of the respondents and allowed the petitions It was urged on its behalf that before finally producing Vanaspati the respondents produced at an intermediate stage what was known as refined oil in the market and although they might not sell it and although Vanaspati when produced was liable to excise duty under another item that could not affect their liability Held that excise duty being leviable on the manufacture of goods and not on their sale the petitioners would no doubt be liable if they produced refined oil as known in the market at an intermediate stage But it was clear that there could be no refined oil as known in the market without deodorisatio according to the specification of <ORG> and the affidavits of the experts factories only after hydrogenation was complete they could not said to produce refined oil at any stage Nor could the respondents be held to manufacture kind of non essential vegetable oil Processing cannot be equated to manufacture which means bringing into existence a new substance These petitions raise a common question of law It is said that for the purpose of manufacturing Vanaspati the petitioners purchased groundnut and the respondents herein til oil from the open market or directly from the manufacturers of such oil all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of Power Accordingly it is said the demand for excise duty on the ground that they produce from the raw oils purchased a product which is liable In resisting these petition <ORG> contended in substance that in the course of the manufacture of Vanaspati the vegetable product form raw groundnut and til oil the petitioners bring into to existence at one stage after carrying out some process with the aid of power what is known to market as refined oil This refined oil falls within the description of vegetable non essential oils all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power and so is liable to excise duty This process of refining generally involves the use of power and machinery There is however this important difference between the view of Dr <NAME> who has filed an affidavit in support of the petitions and that of Mr <NAME> that while according to Mi He first argues that the respondent concerns after they buy the raw oil with all its impurities manufacture by the application of certain processes of refinement a refined oil which is the same as the refined oil available in the market and the aid of power is taken in some of these processes and that it is refined oil thus produced that becomes after further processes vegetable product When the vegetable product comes into existence it becomes liable to excise duty as vegetable product under the present cl which appears to be the same as old cl these same respondents have manufactured refined oil as is known to the market Mr <NAME> is therefore right in his contention that the fact that the substance produced by them at an intermediate stage is not put in the market would not make any differences If from the raw material has been brought into existence a new substance by the application of processes one or more of which are with the aid of power and that substance is the same as refined oil as known to the market an excise duty may be leviable under Item the present item But has it been shown that the substance produced by the petitioners is at any intermediate stage before <ORG> comes into existence refined oil as known to the market We are not satisfied that this has been shown The appellant case is that before hydrogenation has started the substance in the hands of these petitioners is refined oil as known to the market That raises the important question whether any oil is known as refined oil in the market before deodorization has taken place This specification by <ORG> furnishes very strong and indeed almost incontrovertible support for Dr <NAME> view and the respondents contention that without deodorisation the Oil is not refined oil as is known to the consumers and the commercial community Instead of that Mr <NAME> produced before us copies of extracts of a book by In this con nection it has also to be mentioned that the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents are clear and cate gorical while <NAME> affidavit on which reliance was placed on behalf of the appellant is somewhat vague halting and not categorical On a consideration of all these materials we have no doubt about the correctness of the respondents case that the raw oil purchased by the respondents for the purpose of manufacture of Vanaspati does not become at any stage refined oil as is known to the consumers and the commercial community The other branch of Mr <NAME> argument is that even if it be held that the respondents do not manufacture refined oil as is known to the market they must be held to manufacture some kind of non essential vegetable oil by applying to the raw material purchased by them the processes of neutralisation by alkali and bleaching by activated earth and or carbon as by the application of one or more processes the raw material undergoes some change To say this is to equate processing to manufacture and for this we can find no warrant in law The word manufacture used as a verb is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance however minor in consequence the change may be The passage runs thus Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use The Act itself does not define goods but defines excitable goods as meaning goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt article must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought and Sold This consideration of the meaning of the word goods an provides strong support for the view that manufacture which is liable to excise duty under the Central Excises and Salt Act must be the bringing into existence of a new substance known to the market Thus in the very item under which the excise duty is claimed in these cases we find the words in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power The definition of manufacture as in puts it beyond any possibility of controversy that if power is used for any of the numerous processes that are required to turn the raw material into a finished article known to the market the clause will be applicable and an argument that power is not used in the whole process of manufacture using the word in its ordinary sense will not be available Mr <NAME> wanted to derive some assistance for his argument from the words all sorts as used in the clause We are therefore of opinion that <ORG> was right in its conclusion that there was no legal basis for the demands of excise duty which were made The appeals are accordingly dismissed with costs
