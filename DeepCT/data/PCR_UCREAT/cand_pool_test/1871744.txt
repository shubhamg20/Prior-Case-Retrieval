It was laid down under the said instructions that per cent of the posts to be filled by promotion were to be reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes per cent for the Scheduled Casts and per cent for the Backward Classes subject to the conditions that the persons to be considered must possess the minimum necessary qualifications and they should have satisfactory record of service The instructions further provided as under i In a lot of vacancies occurring from time to time those falling at serial numbers mentioned below should be treated as reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes and so on Rule of the Rules which provides for promotion within the service reads as under Promotion within service Subject to the provisions of sub rules and members of the Service shall be eligible for promotion to any of the posts in the Service namely Executive Engineers Superintending Engineers and Chief Engineers Provided that a Member of the Service in whose case the qualifications mentioned in clause a of Rule have been waived shall not be eligible for promotion to the post of Superintending Engineer or above till he has acquired the necessary qualification Promotions shall be made by selection on the basis of merit and suitability in all respects and no member of the <ORG> shall have any claim to such promotion as a matter of right or mere seniority A member of the Service shall not be eligible for promotion to the rank of a Executive Engineer unless he has rendered five years service as an Assistant Executive Engineer Provided that an officer who has rendered six years or more service as an Assistant Executive Engineer shall unless he is considered unsuitable for promotion be given preference for such promotion over an eligible Class II Officer Superintending Engineer unless he has rendered seven years service as an Executive Engineer Chief Engineer unless he has rendered three years service as Superintending Engineer Provided that if it appears to be necessary to promote an officer in public interest the Government may for reasons to be recorded in writing either generally for a specified period or in any individual case reduce the period specified in clauses a and to such extent as it may deem proper It is stated in the writ petition that the petitioners are at serial Nos and of the seniority list of the Service whereas the respondents are at serial Nos and Respondent <NAME> was promoted to the rank of Chief Engineer against the post reserved for the Scheduled Castes by superseding senior colleagues including the petitioners It is further averred in the petition that respondents and were in fact working as Executive Engineers when the petitioners were holding the posts of Superintending Engineers On the above facts the petitioners have challenged the reservation policy on several grounds but Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners has confined the arguments to the following two points The object of reservation is to provide adequate representation to the Scheduled Castes Tribes and Backward classes in services and as such any mechanism provided to achieve that end must have nexus to the object sought to be achieved There were already members of the said category in the cadre but out of them were promoted on the basis of seniority cum merit against the general cat egory posts There being only persons who had been promoted against the reserved posts more Scheduled Castes were sought to be promoted against the reserve vacancies When a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of a particular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve points it has to be taken that the posts shown at the reserve points are to be filled from amongst the members of reserve categories and the candidates belonging to the general category are not entitled to be considered for the reserve posts Article of the Constitution of India permits <ORG> to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizen which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the <ORG> under the <ORG> The fact that considerable number of members of a backward class have been ap pointed promoted against general seats in the <ORG> <ORG> may be a relevant factor for <ORG> to review the question of continuing reservation for the said class but so long as the instructions Rules providing certain percentage of reservations for the backward classes are op erative the same have to be followed We therefore see no force in the first contention raised by the learned counsel and reject the same We see considered force in the second contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners We see no justification to operate the roster thereafter As and when there is a vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post the same has to be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged in the roster Similarly if the persons holding the post at points to or to retire then these slots are to be filled from among the general category By following this procedure them shall neither be short fall nor excess in the percentage of reservation Right to be consid ered for appointment can only be claimed in respect of a post in a cadre As a consequence the percentage of reservation has to be worked out in relation to the number of posts which form the cadre strength The concept of vacancy has no relevance in operating the percentage of reservation Neither should be allowed to eclipse the other For the above reason we hold that for the purpose of applying the rule of a year should be taken as the unit and not the entire of the cadre service or the unit as the case may be The operation of a roster for filling the cadre strength by itself ensures that the reservation remains within the limit On the basis of the material placed before <ORG> it reached the conclusion that if the reservation is permitted in the vacancies after all the posts in cadre are filled then serious consequences would ensure and the general category is likely to suffer considerably Again in the more persons belonging to the general category persons out of the retire Again in the year more persons belonging to the general category retire On the contrary if the roster is permitted to operate till the total posts in a cadre are filled by the same category of persons whose retirement etc We therefore find considerable force in the second point raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners We however direct that the interpretation given by us to the working of the roster and our findings on this point shall be operative prospectively
