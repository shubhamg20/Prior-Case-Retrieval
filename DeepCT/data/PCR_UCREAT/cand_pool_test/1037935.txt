There were number of contusions and abrasions on her face also Pursuant thereto the spot was pointed out by the respondent wherefrom the dead body was recovered PW Dr <NAME> stated that the person who caused the injuries on the vagina of the deceased child would have sustained injuries on his male organ <ORG> sidestepped the circumstance that semen and blood were detected on the under clothes of the accused on the premise that there was delay in seizing those wearing apparels <NAME> gave evidence that when he was returning from his Friday Namaz he saw a young man holding a crying girl around He too gave almost the same reason for remembering it that when he heard next day about the murder of a little girl he had some doubt whether it was the same crying girl Such a reasoning overlooks the broad aspect that a human mind on hearing about any shocking incident would have the tendency to recollect any previous event which could have had a connection with that incident If as a matter of fact those witnesses had occasion to see a crying girl of that age on the very day of the gruesome episode as happened in this case there is nothing improbable in those witnesses remembering the person who was seen in the company of that girl They said that they went to the police station on whereas PW Police Inspector said that they visited me police station only on We do not attach any significance to the aforesaid discrepancy as PW should have been more correct because he was speaking with the help of investigation records while the witnesses would have spoken from their memory only It contains the details of the steps adopted by him and the admissible portion of it reads thus Her dead body is kept concealed in the field I will take it out and produce the same come with me We have pointed out earlier the injuries which the doctor had noted on the person of the accused when he was examined on The significant impact of the said incriminating circumstance is that the accused could not give any explanation whatsoever for those injuries and therefore he had chosen to say that he did not sustain any such injury at all It is disconcerting that a case like his in which the prosecution has presented such reliable and formidable circumstances forming into a completed chain and pointing unerringly to me irresistible conclusion mat the little girl <NAME> was raped and killed by none other than the respondent himself ended in unmerited acquittal from <ORG> of <ORG> unfortunately became a casualty in this case when the High Curt side stepped all such circumstances and exonerated the culprit of such a grotesque crime We therefore set aside the impugned judgment and restore the conviction passed by the trial court We direct the respondent to surrender to bail
