It was alleged that written consent of the Collector of Delhi to institute this suit was granted on September to the plaintiffs who have filed the suit not only for themselves but also on behalf of <ORG> as represented by its Secretary and President It further stated that during the financial year the income of <ORG> was over Rs and that with these funds at its disposal it had every right to donate funds to an institute of ophthalmology without offending its bye laws particularly when this donation was to be made in the scared name of the founder of Sikhism and in commemoration of is birthday Along with the suit an application was filed under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure in pursuance of which notices were issued and the four appellants came to defend the suit In the written statement filed by the appellants it was denied that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit It was further denied that the suit had been filed with the requisite permission under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure and it was averred that all the facts were not disclosed to the authority concerned whose consent to file the suit had been obtained fraudulently Various instances of unauthorised expenses by <ORG> have been cited in the written statements making allegations against the plaintiffs but in connection with the opening of the Eye Hospital it was stated The answering defendants are whole heartedly with the scheme mentioned and would also contribute their mite in a reverential spirit but they can allow the present to take personal advantages to which they are prone and against which the said Advocate is not prepared to give any assurances He held that this <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain the suit in view of its value being Rs that no exception could be taken to the functioning of the present <ORG> pending the disposal of A No of pending in this <ORG> in which an order had been made by one of us <NAME> on May upon consent to the effect that both the parties to the appeal had undertaken not to elect fresh committee during the pendency of the appeal that no details of fraud having been given by the appellants in obtaining the consent of the Collector the plea was not open to them that the <ORG> was not called upon in this suit to decide the allegations to squandering by the respondents as the only direction that was sought for was for the payment of RS The learned Judge was of the view that there was an admission by the appellants with regard to the desirability of making the donation and therefore a direction for making that donation could be given under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure on that admission In the result the learned Judge decreed the suit and declared that the respondents were competent to make the donation of Rs towards the establishment of <ORG> in Delhi and to make further donations to the said institution an occasion arose provided the finances of the <ORG> so permitted We do not find any substances in the complaint of the appellants that Issues were not framed in the suit The first contention that has been raised by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants is that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this suit This question has therefore to be decided on the basis that the valuation of the suit has been fixed correctly at Rupees If only Section of the Punjab <ORG>s Act were to be taken into consideration then there will be no doubt that the principal Civil <ORG> of original jurisdiction to try this suit would be <ORG> Delhi But a change was brought about by the Delhi High <ORG> Act as amended by sub section of Section which provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force <ORG> shall also have in respect of the territory of Delhi ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees This sub section starts with a non obstante clause and is applicable to every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees This being a suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees would be covered by this sub section After the coming into force of the Delhi High <ORG> Act as amended this <ORG> has become the principal Civil <ORG> of original jurisdiction with respect to every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees Full effect has to be given to the language employed in sub section of Section notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force and that can be done only by saving that for purposes of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure <ORG> Delhi will be the principal Civil <ORG> of original jurisdiction in every suit the value of which does not exceed fifty thousand rupees but in other suits the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees this High <ORG> will be the principal Civil <ORG> of original jurisdiction The original jurisdiction value of this High <ORG> is in every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees and therefore this High <ORG> is the principal <ORG> of original civil jurisdiction in every such suit We therefore agree with the learned Single Judge that for the purpose of this suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees the High <ORG> is the principal Civil <ORG> of original jurisdiction as contemplated by Section of the Code of Civil Procedure The next contention raised by the appellants is with respect to the factum and validity of the sanction under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure for filling this suit The bald plea raised by the appellants in their written statement was that they denied the factum and the validity of the consent of the Collector as alleged We do not find any substance in this connection because in the order granting consent the respondents are named in their personal capacity and their capacity qua <ORG> has been mentioned as a description It is therefore clear that the suit has been filed by the respondents in their personal capacity and also as office bearers of <ORG> The last contention is that there was no admission by the appellants in their written statement as contemplated by Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore the learned Single Judge was not right in stating that there was such an admission and deciding the suit on its basis Even though there is strictly no admission to invoke Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure the question is whether the parties were at Issue with regard to the desirability of making the donation of RS In these circumstances even though there is no admission on the part of the appellants they have not raised any objection to the desirability of making the donation Keeping in view that there was no objection to the desirability of making the donation and also the fact that there is pending litigation between the parties the learned Single Judge has taken care to give a direction that the donations must be made through a cross cheque drawn in the payee account This direction will ensure that the donations to be made by the <ORG> will go into proper hands and we have really been unable to find why the appellants who admit the desirability of the donations have filed a written statement to this suit In the case of a public trust where directions of the <ORG> are considered necessary any two or more persons having an interest in the trust can file a suit under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure after obtaining the necessary consent The respondents could in their personal capacity have filed the suit and in this suit the only question which falls for consideration is whether the proposed donation should be made by <ORG> irrespective of who its present office bearers may be
