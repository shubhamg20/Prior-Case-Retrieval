On the rehearing of the case the suit against them was dismissed with costs The main contention before us and in fact the contention on which all the other arguments which have been addressed to us depend is that <ORG> was in error in holding that the right to apply accrued on the setting aside of the ex parte decree and that it should have held that the right accrued on the passing of the final decree dismissing the suit against the appellants because until the suit was finally dismissed the appellants could not tell whether they might not ultimately be obliged to satisfy the decree We think that there is nothing in this contention The question has been raised whether Article or Article of the second schedule of the Limitation Act properly applies to an application such as that in question where a refund was sought in execution of a decree of <ORG> modifying the decree of <ORG> the application was held to be an application made according to law in the proper Court in the sense of Article of the Limitation Act in which the learned Judges who disposed of the case were inclined to think that an application for refund after a decree passed in appeal was governed by Article since it was not one for execution of a decree or order but to enforce a benefit by way of restitution under a decree passed in appeal The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
