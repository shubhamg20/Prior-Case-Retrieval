Forty three writ petitioners the contesting respondents in these appeals approached <ORG> with No of praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State of Tamil Nadu its officers and <ORG> to re convey the lands comprised in Survey Nos and in all acres in Padi village presently in Ambattur Taluk and for passing such further orders as deemed by the court to be fit and proper It was stated that the properties belonged to one <NAME> and it was inherited by his four sons and their successors It was conceded that a notification under Section of the Land Acquisition Act was published on followed by a declaration under Section of that Act on followed up by an Award on It was stated that the petitioners reliably understood that the appropriate authorities had passed orders for dropping the Scheme for which the acquisition was made Thus the valuable lands of the petitioners were kept idle and it caused great hardship to them If the lands that were acquired were not being used for the purpose for which it was intended to be utilised the writ petitioners could very well put the land to their own use The writ petitioners had earlier filed No of before <ORG> praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents therein not to interfere with the peaceful possession of the writ petitioners But the said Writ Petition was dismissed as not pressed with liberty given to the petitioners to file a fresh Writ Petition incorporating a proper prayer It is significant that there is no challenge to such a rejection in the Writ Petition and no prayer for a writ of certiorari to quash such an order The learned single judge proceeded on the basis that the Writ Petition was filed for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents therein to re convey the lands involved in the Writ Petition in terms of Section of the Act as inserted in the State of Tamil Nadu The court proceeded to state that by way of earlier order dated a notification in respect of other lands acquired for the purpose of the Scheme had been quashed and re conveyance ordered and since there was no further development in respect of the lands which were taken possession of by <ORG> there should not be any impediment in the way of the respondents in disposing of the representation of the writ petitioners dated seeking re conveyance of the lands under Section of the Land Acquisition Act The learned Judge did not advert to the fact that a request made earlier in that behalf by the writ petitioners stood rejected and there was no challenge to that rejection Thereafter the <ORG> filed a review petition in <ORG> essentially contending that Section had no application that it had not been heard or notice issued to it before the allowing of the writ appeal and that the order in the writ appeal deserves to be reviewed <ORG> without properly adverting to the aspects that arose for decision simply dismissed the review petition and also closed a contempt of court case filed by the writ petitioners by granting further time to the <ORG> to comply with the directions contained in the order of <ORG> dated The Tamil Nadu Housing <ORG> has come up with Civil Appeal Nos of and Civil Appeal No of challenging the orders on the review petition original judgment and in the contempt of court case The <ORG> of Tamil Nadu has filed the three appeals A Nos and of challenging the orders of <ORG> that are the subject of challenge by <ORG> in its appeals The principle recognised in <NAME> <ORG> has no application to those appeals Learned counsel for the contesting respondents pointed out that there was delay in filing the Petitions for Special Leave to Appeal leading to those appeals But obviously the delay was condoned and leave granted and we now have the three appeals before us for final hearing and disposal There is no material on the basis of which we can hold that the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act had not been completed In fact the prayer in the Writ Petition is for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the <ORG> its officers and <ORG> to re convey the property to the writ petitioners the contesting respondents herein though there is an assertion that the writ petitioners are in possession The learned single judge proceeded on the basis that the claim of the writ petitioners was for re conveyance of the land under Section of the Land Acquisition Act as inserted in the <ORG> of Tamil Nadu We think it proper to extract that allegation I further state that I have given a representation to the Secretary to <ORG> Chennai and Secretary to <ORG> Fort St Except in the case provided for in Section the Government shall be at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any land which possession has not been taken Whenever the Government withdraws from any such acquisition the Collector shall determine the amount of compensation due for the damage suffered by the owner in consequence of the notice or of any proceedings thereunder and shall pay such amount to the person interested together with all costs reasonably incurred by him in the prosecution of the proceedings under this Act relating to the said land On the facts pleaded it is doubtful whether the Government can withdraw from the acquisition since the case of the <ORG> and <ORG> is that possession has been taken and plans finalised to fulfil the purpose for which the acquisition was made There is no plea in the writ petition that a request for re conveyance was made in terms of Section of the Act as amended in the <ORG> of Tamil Nadu Transfer of land to original owner in certain cases Where the <ORG> are satisfied that the land vested in the <ORG> under this Act is not required for the purpose for which it was acquired or for any other public purpose the <ORG> may transfer such land to the original owner who is willing to repay the amount paid to him under this Act for the acquisition of such land inclusive of the amount referred to in sub section A and of Section if any paid under this Act There is no ground based on Section of the Act though the prayer as noticed earlier is for the issue of a writ of mandamus to reconvey the property There is no plea of demand no plea of refusal and no plea of a duty in the <ORG> to re convey We find from the order of the learned single judge dated in the Writ Petition the following statement recorded According to the petitioners the said lands were not put into use by the fourth respondent <ORG> for nearly years Since the said representation of the petitioners has not been disposed of the present Writ Petition came to be filed seeking for the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to re convey the lands situated in Survey Nos and of Padi Village Ambattur Taluk District If <ORG> felt that there was a case to be looked into it should have admitted the writ appeal issued rule nisi to the parties and thereafter heard the matter and disposed it of in the light of the relevant provisions of the Act the law bearing on the subject and the facts obtaining As we see it we find no impediment in the lands in question being utilised for the purpose of putting up a multi storied building containing small flats intended as the public purpose when the acquisition was notified This was an unwarranted assumption on the part of the court which has no foundation in the pleadings and the materials produced in the case We have already noticed that in the Writ Petition there are no sufficient allegations justifying interference by the <ORG> We may also notice that once a piece of land has been duly acquired under the Land Acquisition Act the land becomes the property of the <ORG> The <ORG> can dispose of the property thereafter or convey it to anyone if the land is not needed for the purpose for which it was acquired only for the market value that may be fetched for the property as on the date of conveyance The doctrine of public trust would disable the <ORG> from giving back the property for anything less than the market value in a similar situation this Court observed The question emerges whether the <ORG> can assign the land to the erstwhile owners It is settled law that if the land is acquired for a public purpose after the public purpose was achieved the rest of the land could be used for any other public purpose In case there is no other public purpose for which the land is needed then instead of disposal by way of sale to the erstwhile owner the land should be put to public auction and the amount fetched in the public auction can be better utilised for the public purpose envisaged in the Directive Principles of the Constitution Otherwise the land of the <ORG> should be sold only through the public auctions so that the public also gets benefited by getting higher value It is therefore not necessary for us to go into the further contention raised on the scope of Section of the Act whether the writ petitioners have established any claim to the lands whether the re conveyance can only be to the original owners and not to others and whether if possession has already been made over to <ORG> the <ORG> could exercise its power under that provision We leave open those questions for the High <ORG> to consider as and when the occasion arises on it being approached in the context of Section of the Act We therefore allow the appeals filed by the State of Tamil Nadu and set aside all the orders passed in the Writ Petition and in the writ appeal and in the contempt of court case In view of the above position there is no need to pass any further order in the appeals filed by <ORG>
