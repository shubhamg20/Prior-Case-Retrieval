The right to move the <ORG> under Art An order for furnishing security for the respondent costs retards the assertion or vindication of the fundamental right under Art which confers power upon the <ORG> to make rules empower it to contravene the provisions of Art The rule does not directly place any restriction upon the right of a litigant to move the <ORG> and it raises an interesting and important question about the validity of one of the Rules made by this <ORG> in exercise of its powers under Art It provides that the <ORG> may in the proceedings to which the said Order applies impose such terms as to costs and as to the giving of security as it thinks fit The petitioners then tried to collect the requisite fund but failed in their efforts and that has led to the present petition filed on March right to move the Supreme <ORG> by the appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed and sub Art There is no doubt that the right to move this <ORG> conferred on the citizens of this country by Art is itself a guaranteed right and it holds the same place of pride in the Constitution as do the other provisions in respect of the citizens fundamental rights The fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III which have been made justiciable form the most outstanding and distinguishing feature of the Indian Constitution It is in the light of this position that the Constitution makers thought it advisable to treat the citizens right to move this <ORG> for the enforcement of their fundamental rights as being a fundamental right by itself The fundamental right to move this <ORG> can therefore be appropriately described as the comer stone of the democratic edifice raised by the Constitution The right to move this <ORG> is an absolute right and the content of this right cannot be circumscribed or impaired on any ground such as the interests of the general public Mr <NAME> however conceded that the right to move this <ORG> can be validly regulated by rules of procedure and regulations made with a view to aid the assertion and vindication of the right and to provide for a fair trial of the points raised by the petitioners should be legibly written or typed before it is filed or that the relevant paper book should be prepared in the prescribed manner in order to facilitate the reference in <ORG> or that a notice should be issued to the respondent or for the making of the affidavit in the prescribed manner a certain amount in <ORG> as security for the respondents costs and far from siding or assisting the petitioners assertion of fundamental right it has the effect of retarding or obstructing the same That clearly illustrates the hardship that the rule will work and thus brings out how it contravenes Art because it is a discretionary rule and it vests discretion in this <ORG> either to make an order as to the giving of the security or not to make it as it may deem fit according to the circumstances of each case But he argues that if the prevailing practice is found to be unsatisfactory or inconsistent with the spirit of the rule itself the remedy is to change the practice there is however no vice in the rule the <ORG> must act fairly by both the parties and so if it appears to the <ORG> that it is in the interest of justice that the costs of the respondent should be secured it would be open to the <ORG> to make an order of security in that behalf and a rule which permits such an order to be made in a proper case cannot be said to be inconsistent with Art Mr <NAME> argues that the rule is very wide and would justify the making of an order for security even in cases which do not satisfy the tests laid down for instance by and of the Code and he argues that in such a case the rule must be struck down as a whole In support of this argument reliance has been placed on the decisions of this <ORG> in the cases of As we have just indicated it would have become necessary for us to examine these contentions if the power to make an order for security in appropriate cases had been conceded by the petitioners Mr <NAME> argues that even in cases to which the relevant provisions of and may ordinarily apply this <ORG> has no power to make an order of security in a petition under Art The only test says Mr <NAME> which can be legitimately applied in dealing with the matter is does the rule aid or assist the assertion or vindication of the fundamental right or does it retard or obstruct it If the answer to the question is that the rule retards or obstructs the assertion or vindication of the fundamental right by imposing a pecuniary obligation on the petitioner the rule is bad and there is no authority in this <ORG> to make such a rule under Art and there is no jurisdiction in the <ORG> to make such an order under Art It is this larger question which calls for our decision in the present petition In support of his argument that this <ORG> has no power to make such a rule Mr <NAME> has relied on the decision of this <ORG> in the Cape of Kavalappara <NAME> The State of Madras the learned <NAME> addressed himself to the question as to whether such an application could be dismissed on the ground that it involves the determination of disputed questions of fact and in answering this question in the negative he has stated his conclusion in these words But we do not countenance the proposition that on an application under Art this <ORG> may decline to entertain the same on the simple ground that it involves the determination of disputed questions of fact or on any other ground cannot be dismissed on the ground that it involves the decision of disputed questions of fact or on any other ground and that excludes the ground of nonpayment of security The context shows that any other ground which the learned had in mind must be similar to the ground which he had enumerated before using the said clause there is no alternative but to consider its merits apart from considerations Like res judicata or the competence of the petition itself In our opinion there is no doubt that an order of security for the respondent costs would in some cases effectively bar and in all cases amount to a hindrance in the further progress of the petition Therefore the practical considerations to which reference was made during the course of the arguments have no material bearing in deciding the validity or the constitutionality of the rule or the existence of the relevant power in this <ORG> under Art He urges that the words used in Art Article provides that in exercise of its jurisdiction this <ORG> may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it and it adds that a decree or order so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in the manner prescribed by any law made by <ORG> and until provision in that behalf is so made in such manner as the President may by order prescribe One of the points which fell to be considered by this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> was whether the rights powers and privileges of the members of <ORG> which could be claimed by the members of the State <ORG>s had to stand the scrutiny of the test prescribed by Art In other words the effect of this decision is that if there is a conflict between the rights claimed under the latter part of Art It would be noticed that this argument proceeds on the basis that the order for security infringes the fundamental right guaranteed by Art this <ORG> has jurisdiction to pass such an order If any of the provisions of such a law were to contravene any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III they would be struck down as being unconstitutional and such a law in substance corresponds to the provisions of or it would be struck down on the ground that it purports to restrict the fundamental right guaranteed by Art An order which this <ORG> can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution but it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statutory laws confers upon this <ORG> powers which can contravene the provisions of Article In this connection it may be pertinent to point out that the wide powers which are given to this <ORG> for doing complete justice between the parties can be used by this court for instance in adding parties to the proceedings pending before it or in admitting additional evidence or in remanding the case or in allowing a new point to be taken for the first time That takes us to the second argument urged by the Solicitor General that Art this <ORG> had the power to grant bail in cases brought before it and so there was obviously a conflict between the power vested in this <ORG> under the said Article and that vested in the Governor of the State under Art The said rule can have no application to the present case because on a fair construction of Art Let us now consider whether a rule can be made under Art providing for the making of an order for furnishing security in cases of petitions under Art there would be no power to make such a rule under Art After all rules framed under Art If the wide words used in Art In order to decide this question sometimes notice is issued to the respondent even at the preliminary hearing and it is after hearing the respondent that a rule is issued on the petition Rules framed under Art and no objection can be taken against such orders on the ground that they contravene Art But if a rule or an order imposes a financial liability on the petitioner at the thresh hold of his petition and that too for the benefit of the respondent and non compliance with the said rule or order brings to an end the career of the said petition that must be held to constitute an infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed to the citizens to move this <ORG> under Art There is another aspect of the matter to which reference must incidentally be made Stating that his efforts to collect the requisite amount were unsuccessful the petitioner presented this petition and prayed that the order requiring him to furnish security in the sum of Rs Prima facie by the rule no restriction is placed directly upon the right of a litigant to move this <ORG> for relief against infringement of fundamental rights Undoubtedly an order directing the petitioner to furnish security for the costs of the respondent raises some obstacle to the prosecution of a petition for relief against infringement of fundamental rights claimed by the petitioner Are the order and the authority in exercise of which the order is made on that account void Article substantially makes two provisions By the first clause it guarantees the right to move the Supreme <ORG> by appropriate proceedings Clause declares the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to issue directions orders or writs including certain specified writs for enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part Our Constitution has in Ch III enumerated certain fundamental rights such as equality before the law with the concomitant guarantee against discrimination right of freedom of speech assembly association movement and residence right to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practice any profession or to carry on occupation trade or business freedom of conscience and the right to practice and propagate religion freedom to manage religious affairs and cultural and educational rights But the Constitution has conferred upon the High <ORG> and <ORG> power to issue writs for the protection of those fundamental rights and the Constitution has guaranteed by Art the right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of those rights The right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of the fundamental rights is therefore itself made a fundamental right Law which is repugnant to the effective exercise of the right to move this <ORG> in enforcement of the rights described in Ch III therefore to the extent of inconsistency or contravention would be void Is it that the exercise of the right is to be so unfettered that any law which imposes any restriction in any form whatever against the exercise of that right direct or indirect must be regarded as void Counsel for the petitioner using the language of hyperbole submitted that the right was absolutely absolute and even a law which by itself does not place any restriction upon the exercise of the right but which contemplates the exercise of the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to impose restriction upon the exercise of the right must be regarded guarantees a right to move by appropriate proceedings there is therefore in the Article itself limitation upon the exercise of the right Appropriate proceedings would include the procedure relating to form conditions of lodgement of petitions and compliance with a reasonable directions imposed which would conduce to the smooth conduct of proceeding in this <ORG> Power to make rules for practice and procedure of this <ORG> read with the guarantee under Art to move by appropriate proceedings implies the power to impose procedural restrictions conducive to the orderly progress of the petition for relief for breach of a fundamental right The argument of counsel of the petitioner that the right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of a fundamental right is absolute may involve the plea that rules of the <ORG> which require a petition to be filed legibly written typewritten or lithographed submission of translation of documents not in the English language presentation of affidavits payment of court fee on the petition and process fee for service of notice upon the parties concerned and similar rules would be invalid for all these rules in a sense obstruct the exercise of the right and impose financial obligations which are not insignificant What the Constitution has guaranteed is the right to move this <ORG> i the right to claim redress against an alleged infringement of a fundamental right The party complaining of infringement of a fundamental right has undoubtedly the right to demand that his petition shall be entertained and heard and disposed of according to An order for security for costs of the respondent or for other purposes is a procedural order and unless imposition of an order for furnishing security may be regarded as amounting substantially to a denial of the right to move this <ORG> the insistence of a special rule warranting an exception in proceedings for enforcement of fundamental rights cannot be appreciated Undoubtedly a practice has grown up lately that when rule is issued in petition for enforcement of a fundamental right the <ORG> is requested to consider whether the petitioner should furnish security for the costs of the respondent The matter is then judicially considered and an order requiring the petitioner to furnish security if the <ORG> is satisfied about the necessity of passing such an order is made The practice of considering the question at the initial stage of issuing the rule may require to be altered but there is nothing in the rule which requires that practice to be followed In an appropriate case the <ORG> may make an order suo motu at the threshold of the proceeding or at any time in another on the request made by the respondent of the Constitution which in so far as it is material in this case provides by the first clause that the Supreme <ORG> in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it The jurisdiction of the <ORG> so described undoubtedly embraces power to make an order requiring security in appropriate cases and the impugned rule does no more than enunciate a facet of the jurisdiction of this <ORG> which is conferred by Art The expression as it thinks fit must in the context in which it occurs mean that where the <ORG> deems it necessary for doing complete justice in the cause or matter pending before it the <ORG> may make the order as to giving of security Can the petitioner claim immunity from an order for furnishing security for costs or for other purposes merely because he has commenced a proceeding tinder Art Assuming that an order made in a given case may be erroneous the jurisdiction of the <ORG> conferred by the Constitution under Art It frequently happens that mixed up with pleas of constitutional invalidity of statutes or executive acts having an impact upon fundamental rights allegations of bad faith arbitrariness exercise of power for ulterior purposes and similar allegations are made by litigants resorting to this <ORG> and there is no recognised procedure by which investigation of such allegations of improper conduct may be disentangled from those to be dealt with on a strictly interpretational plane The <ORG> has therefore to hear the entire case dealing both with the validity of the statutes or executive acts and the allegations of improper conduct before it can finally adjudicate upon the claim made by the petitioner of the Constitution no question of conflict between law made by the <ORG> and the guarantee of right to move this <ORG> under Art The provisions of the Constitution contained in Art On the one hand there is the guaranteed right in favour of the litigant by an appropriate proceeding to move this <ORG> for enforcement of a fundamental right on the other there is the jurisdiction vested in this <ORG> to pass all such orders as may be necessary in the interests of justice such orders including inappropriate cases an order for payment of costs by the petitioner There is no warrant for assuming that the exercise of this jurisdiction has to be subordinated to the exercise of the right to move this <ORG> Article is included in Ch III and the right to move this <ORG> is itself made a fundamental right whereas Art and to the extent of inconsistency the right had to yield before the fundamental right guaranteed by Art So read the gurantee of the right to move this <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of fundamental rights cannot be permitted to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the <ORG> where exercise thereof is necessary for doing complete justice
