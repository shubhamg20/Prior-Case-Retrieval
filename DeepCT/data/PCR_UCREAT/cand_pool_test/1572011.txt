This is an appeal under Clause of the Letters Patent from a judgment of Mr Justice <NAME> who has confirmed the decree of the lower <ORG> which in its turn confirmed that of the Court of first instance dismissing the suit with costs was not all paid in cash but there was a provision and declaration in the kabala that out of this consideration money of Rs On the very same day there was an arrangement between the plaintiff and defendant No by which the liability of defendant No under the transfer was acknowledged and accepted and either then or in connection there with this pattah was handed over to defendant No We are clearly of opinion that there was no novation within the meaning of Section of the Contract Act no substitution of a new contract for an old contract and the question to be decided la whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to sue on that registered instrument of the th of August whereby defendant No undertook to pay the plaintiff what was due to him from defendants Nos to There are expressions in the judgments of the <ORG> which are suggestive of an oral contract between the plaintiff and defendant No but that I think was a misconception of the position Indeed the findings of the lower <ORG> do not justify the view that there was a contract but there was as I have already indicated an acknowledgment on the part of defendant No communicated to the plaintiff and accepted by him of an obligation on the part of defendant No towards the plaintiff for the debt which was to be paid by defendant No under the provisions of the registered instrument of the th of August It is material in this connection to observe first that defendants Nos to parted with the whole of their property moveable and immoveable to defendant No secondly that on the same date there was this arrangement between the plaintiff and defendant No which clearly points to a communication to the plaintiff of the transaction and finally that as a result of this the pattah which was regarded by the parties at that time erroneously perhaps as constituting a charge on the property was handed back by the plaintiff to defendant No It appears to me that one may fairly say that this sum of Rs We have here then a position in which it would be in accordance with the principles of justice equity and good conscience the abiding rule in these <ORG> that the plaintiff should be entitled to enforce this claim against defendant No there might possibly be a difficulty in our way but it has to be borne in mind that <NAME> <NAME> More than that we now have ample authority for saying that the administration of justice in these <ORG> is not to be in any way hampered by the doctrine laid down in <NAME> <NAME> I All That appears to me to be a principle which is of distinct use in the consideration of this case It appears to me that we have therefore in the circumstances of this case a condition of affairs in which it would be right to hold that the plaintiff is entitled to enforce his claim in this suit
