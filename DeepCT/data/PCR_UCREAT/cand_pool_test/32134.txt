Clause of the proviso to the saving section provided that all rates taxes and cesses due to <ORG> shall be deemed to be due to the <ORG> to whose area they pertained By an amending Act of <ORG> replaced cl of the proviso to by a new cl which inter alia continued in force all taxes which were in force immediately before the commencement of the Act this amendment was given retrospective effect from the commencement of Act vested in <ORG> plenary power to legislate in respect of every tax which was being lawfully levied in the province that cl of the proviso to of the Act saved the tax and that the amendment was validly made and it saved the tax with retrospective effect from the date of the repeal of the Act But it did confer upon <ORG> a limited legislative power to enact a law with reference to the tax levy so as to continue it The power of <ORG> to repeal the Act which imposed the tax was co extensive with its power to enact such a law Any taxes duties cesses or fees which immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act were being lawfully levied by any Provincial Government municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the Province municipality district or other local area under a law in force on the first day of January nin eteen hundred and thirty five may notwithstanding that those taxes duties cesses or fees are mentioned in the Federal Legislative List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> The precise import significance and effect of the words continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> is the common question which arises in these four appeals which come before us by virtue of certificates under Art <ORG> framed rules for the collection of the tax under of the Act of and the said tax was being collected by this local authority on April when Part III of the Government of India Act came into force It is now common ground that the tax thus levied and collected was a terminal tax on goods carried by railway covered by entry in the Federal Legislative List List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act of While so the Central Provinces and Berar Local Self Government Act was repealed and was replaced by the Central Provinces and Berar Local Government Act which came into force on June There were provisions in the later enactment providing for continuity in the powers to be exercised by <ORG>s whom the former replaced But what is of relevance to the points arising in the present appeals are those contained in a of the Act of which as originally enacted ran On and from date on which this Act comes into force the Central Provinces and Berar Local Self Government Act shall be repealed Provided that a all local authorities constituted under the said Act shall continue to function there under for such time till the constitution of the Sabhas as the Provincial Government may by notification specify all rules and bye laws made all noti fications published all orders issued and all licences and permissions granted under the said Act and in force immediately be fore the commencement of this Act shall so far as they are consistent with this Act be deemed to have been respectively made published issued and granted thereunder all rates taxes and cesses due to the district Council or <ORG> shall be deem ed to be due to the <ORG> to whose area they pertain and all references made in any Act of the Provincial Legislature to the said Act shall be read as if made to this Act or to the corresponding provision thereof The first is that there was an express repeal of the Local Self Government Act of effected by the main part of the section and by of the Amending Act this amendment was given retrospective effect from the commencement of the Local Government Act of It is only necessary to add that if this tax had been lawfully levied by the Janpad Sabhas immediately before January they could continue to be levied after Constitution came into force nothwithstanding the repeal of the Government of India Act by the Constitution and notwithstanding terminal taxes being a tax solely leviable by the Union List in Sch VII by reason of the provision contained in Art duties ceases or fees which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were being lawfully levied by the Government of any <ORG> or by any municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the <ORG> municipality district or other local area may notwith standing that those taxes duties ceases or fees are mentioned in the Union List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law the appellant concern contending that from the date of the coming into force of the Constitution the imposition and collection of the terminal tax by the respondent <ORG> was illegal because the right to levy terminal taxes was vested exclusively in the government of the <ORG> under entry in the First List to the th Schedule to the Constitution and sought the refund of this sum of tax from the respondent <ORG> and also required that it should desist from continuing the imposition and levy of this tax and when the request was not needed served notice on the <ORG> Thereupon the appellant instituted a civil suit inthe court of the Civil Judge at <NAME> praying for a decree for the sum of Rs of the Constitution for deciding the substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and of the Government of India Act as to whether the levy of the tax by the respondent <ORG> was lawful or not These suits were consolidated and were disposed of by a common judgment dated April by which all the suits were dismissed but a certificate was granted under Art The result would therefore be that but for the saving contained in of <ORG> Act it would not have been legally competent for the local authority to continue to levy the tax after <ORG> Act came into force similarly but for Art In other words the tax now sought to be levied and that which was lawfully imposed and collected prior to April were exactly identical in their effect and operation Similarly there was no controversy as regards either the identity of the area in aid of whose local administration the tax as now sought to be collected nor as regards the purposes for which they were utilised as compared with what prevailed on April The principle contention however raised on behalf of the appellant before <ORG> was based upon a denial of the identity of the authorities three Janpad Sabhas with <ORG> Bhandars which levied and collected the tax prior to April The learned Judges of <ORG> rejected this contention and held that the three Janpad Sabhas which replaced <ORG> of Bhandara were in substance identical with the latter principally for the reason that the area covered by the three newly created Janpads was the same as that for which <ORG> functioned and that the purposes for which the tax collected would be utilized which are the criteria specified in were exactly the same Just as it could not be disputed that if there were any change in the composition of <ORG> the identity of a local authority would not be altered for the purposes of the mere splitting up of that local area for being administered by a plurality of <ORG> would not effect any change material for the purposes of the continued exigibility of the tax under As part of the same legislation and taking effect at the same time it was open to that <ORG> to have continued the provisions of the repealed Act of under which the impugned tax was levied so as to enable the newly created Janpad Sabhas to exercise the fiscal powers of <ORG>s which they replaced thus so to speak modifying or qualifying the repeal If this had been done the source of legal authority to levy the tax would even after the Act of came into force have been the repealed Act of which to the extent of the saving would be deemed to have continued in force There was no doubt a saving under the proviso to but the saving in respect of the taxes which was contained in sub cl of the accrued arrears among the several Janpad Sabhas which replaced each <ORG> so that when on June II the Act of came into force the effect of it was that the repeal of the Act of was for all purposes relevant to the matter now in controversy complete and with it the power to levy the tax in future stood No doubt the Provincial <ORG> effected an amendment to in by which the saving was extended to include the right of the Janpad Sabhas to continue to levy the impugned tax and this amendment was given retrospective effect as from Tune but this amendment was beyond the legislative com The argument was also presented in a slightly different form by saying that on the terms of of the Government of India Act there was a provision only for the continuance of the tax and that when once that continuity was broken by a valid piece of legislation such as took place in this case when the Local Self Government Act wes repealed without a properly drafted saving clause enabling the continued levy of the tax the discontinuity created thereby could not thereafter be repaired and the gal filled by further legislation even though it purported to be with restrospective effect Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the respondent Sabhas submitted several answers to sustain the validity of the continued imposition of the tax He first urged that the effect of of the Government of India Act was in effect to vest in Provincial <ORG>s a plenary power to legislate in respect of every tax which was being lawfully levied by local authorities etc Section which is a saving clause and obviously designed to prevent a dislocation of the finances of Local Governments and of local authorities by reason of the coming into force of the provisions of the Government of India Act distributing heads of taxation on lines different from those which prevailed before that date cannot be construed as one conferring a plenary power to legislate on those topics till such time as the Central <ORG> intervened In our opinion this is not an interpretation which the words could reasonably bear and we have therefore no hesitation in rejecting this argument No doubt there is authority for the position that when the meaning of the words used in an enactment is ambiguos or obscure subsequent statutes might sometimes be used as what has been termed a parliamentary exposition of the obscure phraseology that it purported to operate as it were to close the gap but his submission was that if in fact the gap existed and there was factually a period of discontinaity the legislature which had no authority to enact positive legislation with reference to the topic in May was incompetent to pass an enactment with retrospective effect It must however be observed that merely because the legislature is empowered under this entry to constitute local authorities and vest them with powers and jurisdiction it would not follow that these local bodies could be vested with authority to levy any and every tax for the purpose of raising revenue for the purposes of local administration There is no doubt that the general principle is that the power of a legislative body to repeal a law is co extensive with its power to enact each a law as would be seen from the following passage in the judgment by Lord <NAME> in Attorney General for Ontario Attorney General for the Dominion Neither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial legislatures have authority to repeal statutes Which they could not directly enact We have such provision in the case on hand in of the Government of India Act Of course in the absence of legislation indicating a define to discontinue the tax the effect of the provision of the Constitution would be to enable the continuance of the Dower to levy the tax but this does not alter the fact that the provision by its implication confers a limited legislative power to desire or not to desire the continuance of the levy subject to the overriding power of <ORG> to put an end to its continuance and it is on the basis of the existence of this limited legislative power that the right of <ORG> to repeal the taxation provision under the Act of could be rested If we are right so far it would follow that in the exercise of this limited legislative power <ORG> would also have a right to legislate for the continuance of the tax provided if of course the other conditions of are satisfied viz that the tax was one which was lawfully levied by a local authority for the purposes of a local area at the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act If as we have hold earlier there is a limited legislative power in the Province to enact a law with reference to the tax levy so as to continue it the validity of the Act of which manifested the legislative intent to Continue the tax without any break the legal continuity being established by the retrospective operation of the provision has to be upheld
