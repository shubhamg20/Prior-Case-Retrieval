The petitioner immediately addressed a letter to the Regional Passport Officer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of reasons for making the order as provided in A reply was sent by <ORG> <ORG> on th July stating inter alia that the <ORG> decided in the interest of the general public not to furnish her copy of the statement of reasons for the making of the order The position which obtained prior to the coming into force of the Act was that there was no law regulating the issue of passports for leaving the shores of India and going abroad no person can be deprived of his right to go abroad except according to the procedure established by law Section provides for making of an application for issue of a passport or travel document for visiting foreign country Sub section of section says that on receipt of such application <ORG> after making such enquiry if any as it may consider necessary shall by order in writing issue or refuse to issue the passport or travel document or make or refuse to make that passport or travel document endorsement in respect of one or more of the foreign countries specified in the application Sub section confers powers on <ORG> to vary or cancel the conditions of the passport or travel document on the application of the holder of the passport or travel document and with the previous approval of the Central <ORG> The right to go abroad is part of personal liberty within the meaning of that expression as used in Art and no one can be deprived of this right except according to the procedure prescribed by law There is no procedure prescribed by the Passport Act for impounding or revoking a Passport Section is violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles a and and The impugned order has effect of placing an unreasonable restriction on the right of free speech and expression guaranteed to the petitioner under Article a as also on the right to carry on the profession of a journalist conferred under Art The respondents denied the contentions raised by the petitioner The doctrine that Articles and protect or regulate flows in different channels was laid down in <NAME> case in a context which was very different from that in which that approach was displaced by the counter view that the constitution must be read as an integral whole with possi ble overlappings of the subject matter of what is sought to be protected by its various provisions particularly by articles relating to fundamental rights servations in <NAME> case that due process with regard to law relating to preventive detention are to be found in Art In what may be called unoccu pied portions of the vast sphere of personal liberty the substantive as well as procedural laws made to cover them must satisfy the requirements of both Arts and of the Constitution <NAME> theory of natural rights cannot be rejected as totally irfelevantIf we have advanced today towards higher civilization and in a more enlightened era we cannot lag behind what at any rate was the meaning given to personal Both the rights of personal security and personal liberty recognised by what <NAME> termed natural law are embodied in Act of the Constitution are restricted as well as the procedure by which these restrictions are sought to be imposed both substantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them will have to pass the test imposed by Arts Therefore the grant of wide discretionary power to the exe cutive authorities cannot be considered as unreasonable yet there must be procedural safeguards to ensure that the Power will not be used for purposes extraneous to the grant of the power Impounding or revocation are placed side by side on the same footing in the provisions It is clear from the provisions of the Act that there is a statutory right also acquired on fulfilment of the prescribed conditions by the holder of a passport that it should continue to be effective for the specified period so long as no ground has come into existence for either its revocation or for impounding it which amounts to a suspension of it for the time being In an emergent situation the impounding of a passport may become necessary without even giving an opportunity to be heard against such a step which could be reversed after an opportunity is given to the holder of the passport to show why the step was unnecessary However ordinarily no passport could be reasonably either impounded or revoked without giving a prior opportunity to its holder to show cause against the proposed action It is well settled that even when there is no specific provision in a statute or rules made thereunder for showing case against action proposed to be taken against an individual which affects the right of that individual the duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be implied from the nature of the function to be perform by the authority which has the power to take punitive or damaging action This was not done in the present case The petitioner had no opportunity of showing that the ground for impounding it given in this <ORG> either does not exist or has no bearing on public interest or that the public in terest can be better served in some other manner The order should be quashed and the respondent should be directed to give an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause against any proposed action on such grounds as may be available There were no pressing grounds with regard to the petitioner that the immediate action of impounding her passport was called for Even executive authorities when taking administrative action which involves any deprivation of or restriction on inherent fundamental rights of citizens must take care to see that justice is not only done but manifestly appears to be done of the Constitution includes the right to travel abroad and that no person can be deprived of that right except according to procedure established by law The procedure prescribed by law has to be fair just and reasonable not fanciful oppressive or arbitrary The question whether the procedure prescribed by law which curtails or takes away the personal liberty guaranteed by Art is not the journey end because a law which prescribes fair and reasonable procedure for curtailing or taking away the personal liberty granted by Art That test saw its fruition in <ORG> case where the <ORG> giving precedence to the direct and immediate effect of the order over the form and object struck down the Daily Newspapers Price and Page Order on the ground that it violated Article a of the Constitution The culmi nation of this thought process was reached in the <ORG> case where it was held by the majority speaking through <NAME> that the extent of protection against the impairment of a fundamental right is determined by the direct operation of an action upon the individual rights and not by the object of the <ORG> or by the form of the action A Article a guarantees to Indian Citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression It does not delimit the grant of that right in any manner and there is no reason arising either out of interpretational dogmas or pragmatic considerations why courts should strain the language of the Article to cut down amplitude of that right The Constitution guarantees certain fundamental freedoms except where their exercise is limited by territorial considerations The analogy of the freedom of press being included in the right of free speech and expression is wholly misplaced because the right of free expression incontrovertibly includes the right of freedom of press It is obvious that Article though couched in negative language confers fundamental right to life and personal liberty The question that arises for consideration on the language of Art In <NAME> case a narrow interpretation was placed on the words personal liberty But there was no definite pronouncement made on this point since the question before the court was not so much the interpretation of the words personal liberty as the inter relation between Arts In <NAME> case the majority of this <ORG> held that personal liberty is used in the Article as a compendious term to include within itself all varieties of Tights which go to make up the personal liberties of man other than those dealt with in several clauses of Article It was pointed out by the minority that both Articles and are independent fundamental rights though there is a certain amountof overlapping and there is no question of one being carved out of another is of the widest amplitude and covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Art includes with its ambit the right to go abroad and consequently no person can be deprived of this right except according to procedure prescribed by law A The decision of the majority in <NAME> case proceeded on the assumption that certain Articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and where the requirements of an article dealing with the particular matter in question are satisfied and there is no infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by that Article no recourse can be had to a fundamental right conferred by another article The law must therefore be now taken to be well settled that Article does not exclude Article and that even if there is a law prescribing procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty and there is consequently no infringe ment of the fundamental right conferred by Art It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic and therefore it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach No attempt should be made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so would be to violate its magnitude Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits Equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch Article strikes at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omni presence and the procedure contemplated by Article must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article Naturaljustice is a great humanising principle intended to invest law with fairness and to secure justice and over the years it has grown into a widely pervasive rule affecting large areas of administrative action Where <ORG> which has impounded a passport is other than the Central <ORG> a right of appeal against the order impounding the passport is given by section The same result must follow in view of the decision in <NAME> case even if the power to impound a passport were regarded as administrative in character because it seriously interferes with the constitutional right of the holder of the passport to go abroad and entails adverse civil consequences The argument of the Attorney General however was that having regard to the nature of the action involved in the impounding of a passport the audi alteram partem rule must be held to be excluded because if notice were to be given to the holder of the passport and reasonable opportunity afforded to him to show cause why his passport should not be impounded he might immediately on the strength of the passport make good his exit from the country and the object of impounding etc Now it is true that there may be cases where having regard to the nature of the action to be taken its object and purpose and the scheme of the relevant statutory provision fairness in action may warrant exclusion of the audi alteram partem rule Indeed there are certain wellrecognised exceptions to the audi alteram Partem rule established by judicial decisions The word exception is really a misnomer because in these exceptional cases the audi alteram partem rule is held inapplicable not by way of an exception to fairplay in action but because nothing unfair can be inferred by not conferring an opportunity to present or meet a case The audi alteram partem rule may therefore by the experiential test be excluded if importing the right to be heard has the effect of paralysing the administrative process or the need for promptitude or the urgency of the situation so demands But at the same time it must be remembered that this is a rule of vital importance in the field of administrative law and it must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional circumstances where Compulsive necessity so demands It is a wholesome rule designed to secure the rule of law and the <ORG> should not be too ready to eschew it in its application to a given case The <ORG> must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent permissible in a given case The core of it must however remain namely that the person affected must have reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty public relations exercise <ORG> may proceed to impound the passport without giving any prior opportunity to the person concerned to be heard but as soon as the order impounding the Passport is made an opportunity of hearing remedial in aim should be given to him so that he may present his case and controvert that of <ORG> and point out why his passport should not be impounded and the order impounding it recalled There are four grounds set out in section which would justify the making of an order impounding a passport The expression in the interest of the general public has clearly a well defined meaning and the <ORG>s have often been called upon to decide whether a particular action is in the interest of general public or in public interest and no difficulty has been experienced by the <ORG>s in carrying out this exercise It is true that when the order impounding the passport is made by the Central <ORG> there is no appeal against it But it must be remembered that in such a case the power is exercised by the Central <ORG> itself and it can safely be assumed that <ORG> When power is vested in a high authority like the Central <ORG> abuse of power cannot be lightly assumed and in any event if there is abuse if the power the arms of the <ORG> are long enough to reach it and to strike it down The power conferred on <ORG> to impound a passport under section cannot be regarded as discriminatory The test to be applied for determining the constitutional validity of state action with fundamental right therefore was what is the object of the authority in taking the action What is the subject matter of the action and to which fundamental right does it relate However it was only in Cooper Union of India SCR that the doctrine that the object and form of the <ORG> action alone determine the extent of protection that may be claimed by an individual and that the effect of the <ORG> action on the fundamental right of the individual is irrelevant as laid down in <NAME> case was finally rejected This doctrine is in substance and reality nothing else than the test of pith and substance which is applied for determining the constitutionality of legislation where there is conflict of legislative powers conferred on Federal and <ORG> legislatures with reference to legislative lists If the test were merely of direct or indirect effect it would be an open ended concept and in the absence of operational criteria for judging directness it would give the <ORG> an unquestionable discretion to decide whether in a given case a consequence or effect is direct or not Now if the effect of <ORG> action on a fundamental right is direct and inevitable then a fortiorari it must be presumed to have been intended by the authority taking the action and hence this doctrine of direct and inevitable effect is described aptly as the doctrine of intended and real effect and is thus a fundamental right protected by that Article This clearly shows that there is no underlying principle in the Constitution which limits the fundamental right in their operation to the territory of India can be exercisable outside India there is no reason why freedom of speech and expression conferred under a cannot be so exercisable There are no geographical limitations to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art This conclusion would on a parity of reasoning apply equally in relation to fundamental right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business guaranteed under Art The theory that a peripheral or concomitant right which facilitates the exercise of a named fundamental right or gives its meaning and substance or makes its exercise effective is itself a guaranteed right included within the named fundamental right cannot be accepted Where a statutory provision empowering an authority to take action is constitutionally valid action taken under it may offend a fundamental right and in that event though the statutory provision is valid the action may be void Now even if an order impounding a passport is made in the interests of public order decency or morality the restriction imposed by it may be so wide excessive disproportionate to the mischief or evil sought to be averted that it may be considered unreasonable and in that event if the direct and inevitable consequence of the order is to abridge or take away freedom of speech and expression it would be violative of Article a and would not be protected by Article and the same would be the position where the order is in the interests of the general public but it infringes directly and inevitably on the freedom to carry on a profession in which case it would contravene Article without being saved by the provision enacted ion Article What the impugned order does is to impound the passport of the petitioner and thereby prevent her from going abroad and at the date when impugned order was made there is nothing to show that the petitioner was intending to go abroad for the purpose of exercising her freedom or speech and expression or her right to carry on her profession as a journalist The argument that the said expression could not cover a situation where the presence of a person is required to give evidence before a commission of Inquiry is plainly erroneous as it seeks to cut down the width and amplitude of the expression interests of the general public an expression which has a well recognised legal connotation and which is found in Article as well as Article It is true that that there is always a perspective within which a statute is intended to operate but that does not justify reading of a statutory provision in a manner not warranted by the language or narrowing down its scope and meaning by introducing a limitation which has no basis either in the language or in the context of a statutory provision Clauses and of make it clear that there are several grounds in this section which do not relate to foreign affairs OBSERVATION It is true that the power under is rather a drastic power to interfere with a basic human right but this power has been conferred by the legislature in public interest and there is no doubt that it will be sparingly used and that too with great care and circumspection and as far as possible And the universal Declaration of Human Rights has proclaimed in Article that every one has the right to leave any country including his own and to return to his country The right of free movement includes right to travel abroad A Procedure in Article means fair not formal procedure specifically spells out the procedural safeguards for preventive and punitive detention a law providing for such detention should conform to Art Article clubs life with liberty and when we interpret the colour and content of procedure established by law we must be alive to the deadly peril of life being deprived without minimal processual justice legislative callousness despising hearing and fair opportunities of defence More im portantly restraints are permissible only to the extent they have nexus with the approved object One has to view the proximate and real consequence of thwarting transnational travel through the power of the <ORG> exercised under of the Passport Act read with ss and Article defines the <ORG> as including the Government and <ORG> of India and the Government and the <ORG> of each of the <ORG>s and of local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of <ORG> In England section of the Statute of Westminster declares that <ORG> has full power to make laws having extra territorial operation The following are the principles to determine whether the provisions of a Constitution or a Statute have extra territorial application Articles to are applicable only to the territory of India At any rate there is no intention in these Articles indicating extra territorial application So also Articles and which deal with cultural and educational rights are applicable only within the territory of India It is possible that the right conferred by Article a may have extra territorial application It is not likely however that the framers of the Constitution intended the right to assemble peaceably and without arms or to form associations or unions or to acquire hold and dispose of property or to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business to have any extra territorial application for such rights would not be enforced by the <ORG> outside the Indian territory The rights conferred under Article are fundamental rights and Arts These rights cannot be protected by the <ORG> outside its territory and therefore there is a presumption that the constitution makers would not have intended to guarantee any rights which the <ORG> cannot enforce It is most unlikely that before the declaration of human rights was promulgated the framers of the Constitution decided to declare that the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens would be available even outside India Even in the American Constitution there is no mention of right to freedom of speech or expressions as being available outside America The law made under Article to imposes restrictions on the exercise of right of freedom of speech and expression etc In Article however there is no such provision expressly or by necessary implication Therefore the contention of the petitioners that by denying the passport the petitioner fundamental rights guaranteed by Article are infringed cannot be accepted It has been decided by this Court in <NAME> case that the punitive detention for offences under the Penal Code cannot be challenged on the ground that it infringes fundamental rights under Article The rights guaranteed under Article are subject to restrictions that may be placed by Articles to The right not to be deprived of life and personal liberty is subject to its deprivation by procedure established by law In <NAME> case it was held that Article dealt with the rights of the citizens when he was free and would not apply to person who had ceased to be free and has been either under punitive or preventive detention It was further held that Article only applied where a legislation directly hit the rights enumerated in the Article and not where the loss of rights mentioned In that case the impact of legislation under Article on the rights guaranteed under Article was not in issue The basis for the conclusion in <ORG> case is that Articles and are parts of a single pattern and while Article enjoins the right to acquire hold and dispose of property clause of Article authorises imposition of restrictions upon the right The case specifically over ruled the view taken in <NAME> case that the approach and form of the <ORG> action alone need to be considered and the fact of loss of fundamental rights of the individual in general will be ignored However there is no justification for holding that the case is an authority for the proposition that the legislation under Article should also satisfy all the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article Article is related to deprivation of life and personal liberty and it has been held that it is not one of the rights enumerated in Article It was assumed by the judgment that the majority of the <ORG> in <NAME> case held that Article being a complete code relating to preventive detention the validity of an order of detention must be determined directly according to the terms within the four corners of that Article If the obiter dicta based on the wrong assumption is to be taken as the correct position in law it would lead to strange results The view taken in this case also suffers from the same infirmities referred to in the Bank Nationalisation case In <NAME> case also this Court erroneously stated that <NAME> case has taken the view that Article was a complete code In <NAME> case the Court held that though Article does not mention the freedom of press it is settled view of the court that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of press and circulation Since the said Act complies with the requirements of Article i compliance with procedure established by law its validity cannot be challenged If incidentally the Act infringes on the rights of a citizen under Article of the Act it cannot be found to be invalid A The procedure established by law does not mean procedure however fantastic and oppressive or arbitrary which in truth and reality is no procedure at all Section provides for an appeal except when the order is passed by <ORG> They do not supplant the law but supplement it If a statutory provision can be read consistently with the principles of natural justice the court should do so but if a statutory provision that specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application of any rules of natural justice this <ORG> cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory authority and read into the concerned provision the principles of natural justice To a limited extent it may be necessary to revoke or to impound a passport without notice if there is real apprehension that the holder of the passport may leave the country if he becomes aware of any intention on the part of <ORG> or the <ORG> to revoke or impound the passport but that itself would not justify denial of an opportunity to the holder of the passport to state his case before the final order is passed The petitioner has a right to be heard before a final order under section is passed Earlier the courts had taken a view that the principle of natural justice is inapplicable to administrative orders However subsequently there is a change in the judicial opinion The rigid view that principles of natural justice apply only to judicial and quasi judicial acts and not to administrative acts no longer holds the field In case where the Government itself passes an order it should be presumed that it would have made the order after careful scrutiny In the present case there is no reason in declining to furnish to the petitioner statement of reasons for impounding the passport The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> The case before us involves questions relating to basic human rights I have had the advantage of going through the opinions of each of my three learned brethren No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law I may add to the passages cited there some from the judgment of <NAME> Chief Justice who also while distinguishing the objects and natures of articles and gave a wide enough scope to Art <NAME> said at Deprivation total loss of personal liberty which inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes or to work or not to work as and when one pleases and several such rights sought to be protected by the expression personal liberty in article is quite different from restriction which is only a partial control of the right to move freely which is relatively a minor right of a citizen as safeguarded by article Deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India This is made clear when the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in Chapter VIII relating to security of peace or maintenance of public order are read Therefore article cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty I am unable to accept the contention that the word deprivation includes within its scope restriction when interpreting article Article envisages the law of preventive detention So does article read with Schedule Seven List I Entry and lList III Entry Therefore when the subject of preventive detention is specifically dealt with in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights I do not think it is proper to consider a legislation permitting preventive detention as in confli ct with the rights mentioned in article Article does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of personal liberty Personal liberty would primarily mean liberty of the physical body The rights given under article do not directly come under that description They are rights which accompany the freedom or liberty of the person If article is considered to be the only article safeguarding personal liberty several well recognised rights as for instance the right to eat or drink the right to work play swim and numerous other rights and activities and even the right to life will not be deemed protected under the Constitution It seems to me improper to read article as dealing with the same subject as article Article gives the rights specified therein only to the citizens of India while article is applicable to all persons Moreover the protection given by article is very general The legis lative restrictions on the law making powers of the legislature are not here prescribed in detail as in the case of the rights specified in article In my opinion therefore article should be read as a separate complete article In that case <NAME> after conceding that the rights given by article would be incidentally contravened by an order of preventive detention see and expressing the opinion that a wider significance was given by <ORG> to the term personal liberty which may include the right to locomotion as Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for <NAME> wanted the <ORG> to infer gave a narrower connotation to personal liberty as freedom from physical constraint or coercion only <NAME> cited <NAME> for his more restrictive view that personal liberty would mean a personal right not to be subjected to imprisonment arrest or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification He then said It is in my opinion this negative right of not being subjected to any form of physical restraint or coercion that constitutes the essence of personal liberty and not mere freedom to move to any part of the Indian territory It is enough to say at this stage that if the report of <ORG> is an appropriate material upon which the interpretation of the words of the Constitution could be based it certainly goes against the contention of the applicant and it shows that the words used in article of the Constitution do not mean the same thing as the expression SCI personal liberty in article does It is well known that the word liberty standing by itself has been given a very wide meaning by <ORG> of the United States of America It includes not only personal freedom from physical restraint but the right to the free use of one own property and to enter into free contractual relations In the Indian Constitution on the other hand the expression personal liberty has been deliberately used to restrict it to freedom from physical restraint of person by incarceration or otherwise <NAME> however said at To my mind the scheme of the Chapter dealing with the fundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it namely that each article is a code by itself and is independent of the others The case ofa person who is convicted of an offence will come under article and and also under article so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned Preventive detention which is dealt with in article also amounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is referred to in article and is a violation of the right of freedom of movement dealt with in article That there are other instances of overlapping of articles in the Constitution may be illustrated by reference to article and article both of which deal with the right to property and to some extent overlap each other I may point out that the doctrine that Articles and protect or regulate flows in different channels which certainly appears to have found favour in this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra was laid down in a context which was very different from that in which that approach was displaced by the sounder view that the Constitution must be read as an integral whole with possible over lappings of the subject matter of what is sought to be protected by its various provisions par ticularly by articles relating to fundamental rights by permitting making of laws for preventive detention without trial for special reasons in exceptional situations also provided quite elaborately in Article of the Constitution itself whit requirements such law relating to preventive detention must satisfy Therefore when this <ORG> was called upon to judge the validity of provisions relating to preventive detention it laid down in <NAME> case supra that the tests of due process with regard to such laws are to be found in Article of the Constitution exclusively because this article constitutes a self contained code for laws of this description It appears to me with great respect that other observations relating to the separability of the subject matters of Articles and were mere obiter dicta But the real issue there was whether in the face of Article of theConstitution which provides all the tests of procedural validity of alaw regulating preventive detention other tests could be im ported from Article of the Constitution or elsewhere into procedure established by law It seems to me that this aspect of <NAME> case supra is important to remember if we are to correctly understand what was laid down in that case I have already referred to the passages I cited in <NAME> case supra to show that even in <NAME> case supra the majority of judges of this <ORG> took the view that the ambit of personal liberty protected by Article is wide and comprehensive One can however say that no question of due process of law can really arise apart from procedural requirements of preventive detention laid down by Article in a case such as the one this <ORG> considered in <NAME> case supra This article in dicates the pattern of the procedure established by law for cases of preventive detention I have no doubt that in what may be called unoccupied portions of the vast sphere of personal liberty the substantive as well as procedural laws made to cover them must satisfy the requirements of both Articles and of the Constitution Articles dealing with different fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution do not represent entirely separate streams of rights which do not mingle at many points This natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks fit without any restraint or control unless by the law of nature being a right inherent in us by birth and one of the gifts of God to man at his creation when he endued him with the faculty of free will And these may be reduced to three principal or primary articles the right of personal security the right of personal liberty and the right of private property because as there is no other known method of compulsion or abridging man natural free will but by an infringement or diminution of one or other of these important rights the preservation of these involate may justly be said to include the preservation of our civil immunities in their largest and most extensive sense This personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion of changing situation or moving one person to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint unless by due course of law If we have advanced today towards what we believe to be a higher civilisation and a more enlightened era we cannot fall behind what at any rate was the meaning given to personal liberty long ago by <NAME> As indicated above it included the power of locomotion of changing situation or moving one person to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint unless by due course of law I think that both the rights of personal security and of cc personal liberty recognised by what <NAME> termed natural law are embodied in Article of the Constitution In the most inalienable of such rights a distinction must be made between possession of a right and its exercise Take for example Article No person shall be deprived of his life or personalliberty except according to procedure established by law The deprivation when it takes place is not of the right which was immutable but of the continued exercised of right Detailed reasons were given by me in <NAME> case supra for taking what I found to be and still find as the only view I could possibly take if I were not to disregard as I could not properly do what had been held by larger benches and what I myself consider to be the correct view that natural law rights were meant to be converted into our Constitutionally recognised fundamental rights atleast so far as they are expressly mentioned so that they are to be found within it and not outside it We have to decide in each specific case as it arises before us what the result of such a balancing is There is nothing ther to suggest that restrictions on right the exercise of which may involve going out of the country or some activities abroad are excluded from the purview of tests contemplated by articles to So far as the impugned action in the case before us is concerned it took place in India and against an Indian citizen residing in India Both substantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them will have to pass tests imposed by articles and whenever facts justifying the invocation of either of these articles may be disclosed Therefore although we may not deny the grant of wide discretionary power to the executive authorities as un reasonable in such cases yet I think we must look for and find procedural safeguards to ensure that the power will not be used for purposes extraneous to the grant of the power before we uphold the validity of the power conferred The view I have taken above proceeds on the assumption that there are inherent or natural human rights of the individual recognised by and embodied in our Constitution Persons upon whom these basic rights are conferred can exercise them so long as there is no justifiable reason under the law enabling deprivations or restrictions of such rights If either the reason sanctioned by the law is absent or the procedure followed in arriving at the conclusion that such a reason exists is unreasonable the order having the effect of deprivation or restriction must be quashed Section of the Act provides an appeal to <ORG> from every order passed under section sub of the Act It seems to me from the provisions of section and of the Act read with other provisions that there is a statutory right also acquired on fulfilment of prescribed conditions by the holder of a passport that it should continue to be effective for the specified period so long as no ground has come into existence for either its revocation or for impounding it which amounts to a suspension of it for the time being It may be that in an emergent situation the impounding of a passport may become necessary without even giving an opportunity to be heard against such a step which could be reversed after an opportunity given to the holder of the passport to show why the step was unnecessary but ordinarily no passport could be reasonably either impounded or revoked without giving a prior opportunity to its holder to show cause against the proposed action Hence ordinarily an opportunity to be heard in defence after a show cause notice should be given to the holder of a passport even before impounding it It is well established that even where there is no specific provision in a statute or rules made thereunder for showing cause against action proposed to be taken against an individual which affects the rights of that individual the duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be implied from the nature of the function to be performed by the authority which has the power to take punitive or damaging action judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional set up that every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the <ORG> or its officers Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed it need not be shown to be super added If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power If the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a Person is made the order is a nullity That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case In England the rule was thus expressed by <NAME> in <NAME> Wandsworth Board of Works The laws of <NAME> and man both give the party an opportunity to make his defence if he has any Adam says <NAME> where art thou Hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat And the same question was put to Eve also I find no difficulty whatsoever in holding on the strength of these well recognised principles that an order impounding a passport must be made quasi judicially This was not done in the case before us Furthermore the petitioner has bad no opportunity of showing that the ground for impounding it finally given in this Court either does not exist or has no bearing on public interest or that public interest cannot be better served in some other manner Therefore speaking for myself I would quash the order and direct the opposite parties to give an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause against any proposed action on such grounds as may be available I am not satisfied that there were present any such pressing grounds with regard to the petitioner before us that the immediate action of impounding her passport was called for Furthermore the rather cavalier fashion in which disclosure of any reason for impounding her passport was denied to her despite the fact that the only reason said to exist the possibility of her being called to give evidence before a commission of inquiry and stated in the counter affidavit filed in this Court is not such as to be reasonably deemed to necessitate its concealment in It appears to me that even executive authorities when taking administrative action which involves any deprivations of or restrictions on inherent fundamental rights of citizens must take care to see that justice is not only done but manifestly appears to be done The challenge is founded on the following grounds To the extent to which section of the Passport Act authorises the passport authority to impound a passport in the interests of the general public it is violative of article of the Constitution since it confers vague and undefined power on the passport authority Section is void as conferring an arbitrary power since it does not provide for a hearing to the holder of the passport before the passport is impounded Section is violative of article of the Constitution since it does not prescribe procedure within the meaning of that article and since the procedure which it prescribes is arbitrary and unreasonable and Section offends against articles a and since it permits restrictions to be imposed on the rights guaranteed by these articles even though such restrictions cannot be imposed under articles and At first the passport authority exercising its power under section of the Act refused to furnish to the petitioner the reason for which it was considered necessary in the interests of general public to impound her passport But those reasons were disclosed later in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> in answer to the writ petition this Court ruled by majority that the expression personal liberty which occurs in article of the Constitution includes the right to travel abroad and that no person can be deprived of that right except according to procedure established by law The procedure prescribed by law has to be fair just and reasonable not fanciful oppressive or arbitrary The question whether the procedure prescribed by a law which curtails or takes away the personal liberty guaranteed by article is reasonable or not has to be considered not in the abstract or on hypothetical considerations like the provision for a full dressed hearing as in a Courtroom trial but in the context primarily of the purpose which the Act is intended to achieve and of urgent situations which those who are charged with the duty of administering the Act may be called upon to deal with Secondly even the fullest compliance with the requirements of article is not the journey end because a law which prescribes fair and reasonable procedure for curtailing or taking away the personal liberty guaranteed by article has still to meet a possible challenge under other Provisions of the Constitution like for example articles and adopted the same approach and considered the question whether the Maintenance of Internal Security Act violated the right guaranteed by article am in entire agreement with Brother <NAME> when he says The law must therefore now be taken to be well settled that article does not exclude article and that even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty and there is consequently no infringement of the fundamental right conferred by article such law in so far as it abridges or takes away any fundamental right under article would have to meet the challenge of that article The interplay of diverse articles of the Constitution guaranteeing various freedoms has gone through vicissitudes which have been elaborately traced by Brother <NAME> That test saw its fruition in Sakal Papers where the <ORG> giving precedence to the direct and immediate effect of the order over its form and object struck down the Daily Newspapers Price and Page Order on the ground that it violated article a of the Constitution The culmination of this thought process came in the Bank Nationalisation Case supra where it was held by the majority speaking through <NAME> that the extent of protection against impairment of a fundamental right is determined by the direct operation of an action upon the individual rights and not by the object of the legislature or by the form of the action The right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India which are contained in clauses and of article are of this nature Nor indeed does the fact that restraints on the freedoms guaranteed by Article can be imposed under Articles to by the <ORG> furnish any clue to that question But the ambit of a freedom cannot be measured by the right of a <ORG> to pass laws imposing restrictions on that freedom which in the generality of cases have a geographical limitation Article a guarantees to Indian citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression It does not delimit that right in any manner and there is no reason arising either out of interpretational dogmas or pragmatic considerations why the courts should strain the language of the Article to cut down the amplitude of that right The plain meaning of the clause guaranteeing free speech and expression is that Indian citizens are entitled to exercise that right wherever they choose regardless of geographical considerations subject of course to the operation of any existing law or the power of the <ORG> to make a law imposing reasonable restrictions in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence as provided in article In fact that seems to me to be the crux of the matter for which reason I said though with respect that the form in which the learned Attorney General stated his proposition was likely to cloud the true issue The Constitution guarantees certain fundamental freedoms and except where their exercise is limited by territorial considerations those freedoms may be exercised wheresoever one chooses subject to the exceptions or qualifications mentioned above It seems to me impossible to answer this question in the affirmative as is contended by the petitioner counsel <NAME> The analogy of the freedom of press being included in the right of free speech and expression SCI is wholly misplaced because the right of free expression incontrovertibly includes the right of freedom of the press Our Constitution too strides in its majesty but may it be remembered without the due process clause I prefer to be content with a decision directly in point <ORG> In which this Court rejected the contention that the freedom to form associations or unions contained in article carried with it the right that a workers union could do all that was necessary to make that right effective in order to achieve the purpose for which the union was formed I share his opinion that though the right to go abroad is not included in the right contained in article a if an order made under section of the Act does in fact violate the right of free speech and expression such an order could be struck down as unconstitutional The principal challenge set out in the petition against the legality of the action of the Government was based mainly on the ground that section in so far as it empowers <ORG> to impound a passport in the interests of the general public is violative of the equality clause contained in Art of the Constitution since the condition denoted by the words in the interests of the general public limiting the exercise of the power is vague and undefined and the power conferred by this provision is therefore excessive and suffers from the vice of over breath The petition also contained a challenge that an order under section impounding a passport could not be made by <ORG> without giving an opportunity to the holder of the passportto be heard in defence and since in the present case the passport was impounded by the Government without affording an apportunity of hearingto the petitioner the order was null and void and in the alternativeif section were read in such a manner as to exclude the right of hearing the section would be infected with the vice ofarbitrariness and it would be void as offending Article The hearing of the petition was fixed on th August but before that the petitioner filed an application for urging additional grounds and by this application two further grounds were sought to be urged by her One ground was that section is ultra vires Article since it provides for impounding of passport without any procedure as required by that Article or in any event even if it could be said that there is some procedure prescribed under the passport Act it is wholly arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore not in compliance with the requirement of that article The other ground urged on behalf of the petitioner was that section is violative of Articles a and inasmuch as it authorises imposition of restrictions on freedom of Speech and expression guaranteed under Article a and freedom to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation or business guaranteed under Article and these restrictions are impermissible under Article and Article respectively Before we examine the rival arguments urged on behalf of the parties in regard to the various questions arising in this petition it would be convenient to set out the relevant provisions of the Passport Act The position which obtained prior to the coming into force of this Act was that there was no law regulating the issue of passports for leaving the shores of India and going abroad This Court by a majority bela that the expression personal liberty in Article takes in the right of locomotion and travel abroad and under Article no person can be deprived of his right to go abroad except according to the procedure established by law and since no law had been made by the <ORG> regulating or prohibiting the exercise of such right the refusal of passport was in violation of Article and moreover the discretion with the executive in the matter of issuing or refusing passport being unchannelled and arbitrary it was plainly violative of Article and hence the order refusing passport to the petitioner was also invalid under that Article Section sub section provides for making of an application for issue of a passport or travel document or for endorsement on such passport or travel document for visiting foreign country or countries and sub section says that on receipt of such application <ORG> after making such inquiry if any as it may consider necessary shall by order in writing issue or refuse to issue the passport or travel document or make or refuse to make on the passport or travel document endorsement in respect of There are foul grounds set out in this sub section and of them the last is that in the opinion of <ORG> the presence of the applicant in such foreign country is not in the public interest Then we come to section which is the material section which falls for consideration Sub section provides that <ORG> may impound or cause to be impounded or revoke a passport or travel document on the grounds set out in clauses a to The order impounding the passport in the present case was made by <ORG> under clause which reads as follows if the passport authority deems it necessary so to do in the interest of the Sovereignty and Integrity of India the security of India friendly relations of India with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public The particular ground relied upon for making the order was that set out in the last part of clause namely that <ORG> deems it necessary to impound the passport in the interests of the general public It was in virtue of the provision contained in the latter part of this sub section that <ORG> declined to furnish a copy of the statement of reasons for impounding the passport of the petitioner on the ground that it was not in the interests of the general public to furnish such copy to the petitioner It is indeed a matter of regret that <ORG> should have taken up this attitude in reply to the request of the petitioner to be supplied a copy of the statement of reasons because ultimately when the petition came to be filed <ORG> did disclose the reasons in the affidavit in reply to the petition which shows that it was not really contrary to public interest and if we look at the reasons given in the affidavit in reply it will be clear that no reasonable person could possibly have taken the view that the interests of the general public would be prejudiced by the disclosure of the reasons This is an instance showing how power conferred on a statutory authority to act in the interests of the general public can sometimes be improperly exercised If the reasons given are not relevant and there is no nexus between the reasons and the ground on which the passport has been impounded it would be open to the holder of the passport to challenge the order impounding it in a court of law and if the court is satisfied that the reasons are extraneous or irrelvant the court would strike down the order The passport authority would have to satisfy the court by placing proper material that the giving of reasons would be clearly and indubitably against the interests of the general public and if the <ORG> is not so satisfied the <ORG> may require the passport authority to disclose the reasons subject to any valid and lawful claim for privilege which may be set up on behalf of the Government Here in the present case as we have already pointed out <ORG> did initially claim that it would be against the interests of the general public to disclose the reasons for impounding the passport but when it came to filing the affidavit in reply <ORG> very properly abandoned this unsustainable claim and disclosed the reasons The question whether these reasons have any nexus with the interests of the general public or they are extraneous and irrelevant is a matter which we shall examine when we deal with the arguments of the parties Meanwhile proceeding further with the resume of the relevant provisions reference may be made to section which provides for an appeal inter alia against the order impounding or revoking a passport or travel document under sub section of section But there is a proviso to this section which says that if the order impounding or revoking a passport or travel document is passed by <ORG> there shall be no right to appeal These are the relevant provisions of the Act in the light of which we have to consider the constitutionality of sub section of section and the validity of the order impounding the passport of the petitioner Meaning and content of personal liberty in article The first contention urged on behalf of the petitioner in support of the petition was that the right to go abroad is part of personal liberty within the meaning of that expression as used in Article and no one can be deprived of this right except according to the procedure prescribed by law There is no procedure prescribed by the Passport Act for impounding or revoking a passport and thereby preventing the holder of the passport from going abroad and in any event even if some procedure can be traced in the relevant provisions of the Act it is unreasonable and arbitrary inasmuch as it does not provide for giving an opportunity to the holder of the passport to be heard against the making of the order and hence the action of the central Government in impounding the passport of the petitioner is in violation of Article This contention of the petitioner raises a question as to the true interpretation of Article what is the nature and extent of the protection afforded by this article What is the meaning of personal liberty does it include the right to go abroad so that this right cannot be abridged or taken away except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law What is the inter relation between Art and Article Does Article merely require that there Must be some semblance of procedure howsoever arbitrary or fanciful prescribed by law before a person can be deprived of his personal liberty or that the procedure must satisfy certain requisites in the sense that it must be fair and reasonable Article occurs in Part III of the Constitution which confers certain fundamental rights These fundamental rights had their roots deep in the struggle for independence and as pointed out by <NAME> in The Indian Constitution Cornerstone of a Nation they were included in the Constitution in the hope and expectation that one day the tree of true liberty would bloom in India It is apparent from the enunciation of these rights that the respect for the individual and his capacity for individual volition which finds expression there is not a self fulfilling prophecy Articles to occur under the heading Right to Equality and of them by far the most important is Article which confers a fundamental right by injuncting the <ORG> not to deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India It provides that all citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business permit reasonable restrictions to be imposed on the exercise of the fundamental rights guaranteed under clause of that article No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law It is obvious that Article though couched in negative language confers the fundamental right to life and personal liberty So far as the right to personal liberty is concerned it is ensured by providing that no one shall be deprived of personal liberty except according to procedure prescribed by law But there was no definite pronouncement made on this point since the question before the <ORG> was not so much the interpretation of the words personal liberty as the inter relation between Article and that the question as to the proper scope and meaning of the expression personal liberty came up pointedly for consideration for the first time before this <ORG> The majority of the Judges took the view that personal liberty is used in the article as a compendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of man other than those dealt with in the several clauses of Article There is no question of one being carved out of another We shall have occasion to analyse and discuss the decision in <NAME> case a little later when we deal with the arguments based on infraction of Articles a and but it is sufficient to state for the present that according to this decision which was a decision given by the full <ORG> the fundamental rights conferred by Part III are not distinct and mutually exclusive rights It was hold in <NAME> case and that is clear from the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> because <NAME> <NAME> in so many terms disapproved of the contrary statement of law contained in the opinions of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> in A <NAME> case that even where a person is detained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law as mandated by Article the protection conferred by the various clauses of Article does not cease to be available to him and the law authorising such detention has to satisfy the test of the applicable freedom under Article clause This would clearly show that Articles and are not mutually exclusive for if they were there would be no question of a law depriving a person of personal liberty within the meaning of Article having to meet the challenge of a fundamental right under Article Indeed in that event a law of preventive detention which deprives a person of personal liberty in the narrowest sense namely freedom from detention and thus falls indisputably within Art It is indeed difficult to see on what principle we can refuse to give its plain natural meaning to the expression personal liberty as used in Article and read it in a narrow and restricted sense so as to exclude those attributes of personal liberty which are specifically dealt with in Article We do not think that this would be a correct way of interpreting the provisions of the Cons titution conferring fundamental rights We may point out even at the cost of repetition that this <ORG> has said in so many terms in <NAME> case that each freedom has different dimensions and there may be overlapping between different fundamental rights and therefore it is not a valid argument to say that the expression personal liberty in Article must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping between that article and Article The expression personal liberty in Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Article held by this Court in <NAME> case that personal liberty within the meaning of Article includes within its ambit the right to go abroad and consequently no person can be deprived of this right except according to procedure prescribed by law Prior to the enactment of the Passports Act there was no law regulating the right of a person to go abroad and that was the reason why the order of the Passport Officer refusing to issue passport to the petitioner in <NAME> case was struck down as invalid It win be seen at once from the language of Article that the protection it secures is a limited one Thus no person can be deprived of his right to go abroad unless there is a law made by the <ORG> prescribing the procedure for so depriving him and the deprivation is effected strictly in accordance with such procedure It was for this reason in order to comply with the requirement of Article that <ORG> enacted the Passports Act for regulating the tight to go abroad This indeed was conceded by the learned Attorney General who with his usual candour frankly stated that it was not possible for him to contend that any procedure howsoever arbitrary oppressive or unjust may be prescribed by the law There was some discussion in <NAME> case in regard to the nature of the procedure required to be prescribed under Article and at least three of the learned Judges out of five expressed themselves strongly in favour of the view that the procedure cannot be any arbitrary fantastic or oppressive procedure <NAME> did not go as far as that but he did say that certain basic principles emerged as the constant factors known to all those procedures and they formed the core of the procedure established by law <NAME> also observed that Article requires that there should be some form of proceeding before a person can be condemned either in respect of his life or his liberty and it negatives the idea of fantastic arbitrary and oppressive forms of proceedings But apart altogether from these observations in <NAME> case which have great weight we find that even on principle the concept of reasonableness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by Article having regard to the impact of Article on Article that so long as a law of preventive detention satisfies the requirements of Article it would be within the terms of Article and it would not be required to meet the challenge of Article This view proceeded on the assumption that certain articles in the constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and where the requirements of an article dealing with the particular matter in question are satisfied and there is no infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by that article no recourse can be had to a fundamental right conferred by another article The majority judges held that though a law of preventive detention may pass the test of Article it has yet to satisfy the requirements of other fundamental rights such as Article The view of <NAME> on the other hand was that preventive detention was a direct breach of the right under Article and that a law providing for preventive detention The same view was affirmed once again by a Bench of four The law must therefore now be taken to be well settled that Article does not exclude Article and that even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty and there is consequently no infringement of the fundamental right conferred by Article such law in so far as it abridges or takes away any fundamental right under Article would have to meet the challenge of that article Now if a law depriving a person of personal liberty and prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the meaning of Article has to stand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article which may be applicable in a given situation ex hypothesi it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article The special law in each of these two cases undoubtedly pres cribed a procedure for trial of the specified offences and this procedure could not be condemned as inherently unfair or unjust and there was thus compliance with the requirement of Article but even so the validity of the special law was tested before <ORG> on the touchstone of Article and in one case namely <NAME> case the validity was upheld and in the other namely <NAME> case it was struck down It was held in both these cases that the procedure established by the special law must not be violative of the equality clause Now the question immediately arises as to what is the requirement of Article what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in this article There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution And therefore it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach No attempt should be made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned Within traditional and doctrinaire limits In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article must answer the best of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article How far natural justice is air essential element of procedure established by law The question immediately arises does the procedure prescribed by the Passports Act for impounding a passport meet the test of this requirement Is it right or fair or just The argument of the petitioner was that it is not because it provides for impounding of a passport without affording reasonable opportunity to the holder of the passport to be heard in defence Any procedure which permits impairment of the constitutional right to go abroad without giving reasonable opportunity to show cause cannot but be condemned as unfair and unjust and hence there is in the present case clear infringement of the requirement of Article Now it is true that there is no express provision in the Passports Act which requires that the audi alteram partem rule should be followed before impounding a passport but that is not conclusive of the question A long course of decision beginning with Dr <NAME> case and ending with some very recent cases establish that although there are no positive words in the statute requiring that the party shall be heard yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of In fact there are two main principles in which the rules of natural justice are manifested namely Nemo Judex in Sua Causa and audi alteram partem We are not concerned here with the former since there is no case of bias urged here Can it be imported in the procedure for impounding a passport We may commence the discussion of this question with a few general observations to emphasise the increasing importance of natural justice in the field of administrative law Natural justice is a great humanising principle intended to invest law with fairness and to secure justice and over the years it has grown into a widely pervasive rule affecting large areas of administrative action Lord <NAME> of <ORG> spoke of this rule in eloquent terms in his address before <ORG> We can I think take pride in what has been done in recent periods and particularly in the field of administrative law by invoking and by applying these principles which we broadly classify under the designation of natural justice Does natural justice qualify to be described as a majestic conception I believe it does Is it just a rhetorical but vague phrase which can be employed when needed to give a gloss of assurance I believe that it is very much more If it can be summarised as being fair play in action who could wish that it would ever be out of action It denotes that the law is not only to be guided by reason and by logic but that its purpose ill not be fulfilled it lacks more exalted inspiration We often speak of the rules of natural justice But there is nothing rigid or mechanical about them But any analysis must bring into relief rather their spirit and their inspiration than any precision of definition or precision as to application We do not search for prescriptions which will lay down exactly what must in various divergent situations be done Nor do we wait for directions from <ORG> The common law has abundant riches there we may find what <NAME> called the justice of the common law Thus the soul of natural justice is fair play in action and that is why it has received the widest recognition throughout the democratic world In the United States the right to an administrative hearing is regarded as essential requirement of fundamental fairness And in England too it has been held that fair play in action demands that before any prejudicial or adverse action is taken against a person he must be given an opportunity to be heard The rule was stated by Lord <NAME> in these terms in <NAME> Secretary of State for Home Affairs where a public officer has power to deprive a person of his liberty or his property the general principle is that it has not to be done without his being given an opportunity of being heard and of making representations on his own behalf It has even gained access to <ORG> It is the quintessence of the process of justice inspired and guided by fair play in action If we look at the speeches of the various law Lords in <NAME> case it will be seen that each one of them asked the question whether in the particular circumstances of the case the <ORG> acted unfairly so that it could be said that their procedure did not match with what justice demanded or was the procedure adopted by the <ORG> in all the circumstances unfair The test adopted by every law Lord was whether the procedure followed was fair in all the circumstances and fair play in action required that an opportunity should be given to the tax payer to see and reply to the counter statement of the Commissioners before reaching the conclusion that there is a prima facie case against him The inquiry must therefore always be does fairness in action demand that an opportunity to be heard should be given to the person affected Now if this be the test of applicability of the doctrine of natural justice there can be no distinction between a quasi judicial function and an administrative function for this purpose There was however a time in the early stages of the development of the doctrine of natural justice when the view prevailed that the rules of natural justice have application only to a quasi judicial proceeding as distinguished from an administrative proceeding and the distinguishing feature of a quasi judicial proceeding is that the authority concerned is required by the law under which it is functioning to act judicially This requirement of a duty to act judicially in order to invest the function with a quasi judicial character was spelt out from the following observation of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> wherever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially act in excess of their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of <ORG> Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Legislative Committee of <ORG> read this observation to mean that the duty to act judicially should be an additional requirement existing independently of the authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects something super added to it But this was plainly contrary to the earlier authorities and in the epoch making decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Baldwin which marks a turning point in the history of the development of the doctrine of natural justice Lord <NAME> pointed out how the gloss of Lord <NAME> was based on a misunderstanding of the observations of <NAME> <NAME> and it went counter to the law laid down in the earlier decisions of the <ORG> Lord <NAME> observed If Lord <NAME> meant that it is never enough that a body has a duty to determine what the rights of an individual should be but that there must always be something more to impose on it a duty to act judicially then that appears to me impossible to reconcile with the earlier authorities The learned law Lord held that the duty to act judicially may arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed and it need not be shown to be superadded another historic decision in this branch of the law that in recent years the concept of quasi judicial power has been undergoing radical change and said The dividing line between an administrative power and a quasi judicial power is quite thin and is being gradually oblite rated for determining whether a power is an administrative power or a quasi judicial power one has to look to the nature of the power conferred the person or persons on whom it is conferred the framework of the law conferring that power the consequences ensuing from the exercise of that power and the manner in which that power is expected to be exercised We have already discussed this aspect of the question on principal and shown why no distinction can be made between an administrative and a quasi judicial proceeding for the purpose of applicability of the doctrine of natural justice This position was judicially recognised and accepted and the dichotomy between administrative and quasi judicial proceedings vis a vis doctrine of natural justice was finally discarded as unsound by the decisions in In re <NAME> All Infant and <NAME> Secretary of State for Home Affairs supra in England and so far as India is concerned by the memorable decision rendered by this Court in <NAME> case supra Lord <NAME> pointed out in the course of his judgment in In Re <NAME> An Infant supra But at the same time I myself think that even if an Immigration officer is not in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him of the matters in the sub section and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him is not as I see it a question of acting or being required to act judicially but of being required to act fairly Good administration and an honest or bonafide decision must as it seems to me I appreciate that in saying that it may be said that one is going further than is permitted on the decided cases because heretofore at any rate the decisions of the courts do seem to have drawn a strict line in these matters according to whether there is or is not a duty to act judicially or quasi judicially These rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made In other words they do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it Till very recently it was the opinion of the courts that unless the authority concerned was required by the law under which it functioned to act judicially there was no room for the application of the rules of natural justice What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the enquiry is held and the constitution of the <ORG> or body of persons appointed for that purpose Moreover a passport can be impounded by <ORG> only on certain specified grounds set out in sub section of section and <ORG> would have to apply its mind to the facts and circumstances of a given case and decide whether any of the specified grounds exists which would justify impounding of the passport Where <ORG> which has im pounded a passport is other than <ORG> a right of appeal against the order impounding the passport is given by section and in the appeal the validity of the reasons given by <ORG> for impounding the passport can be canvassed before <ORG> The same result must follow in view of the decision in <NAME> case even if the power to impound a passport were regarded as administrative in character because it seriously interferes with the constitutional right of the holder of the passport to go abroad and entails adverse civil consequences Now as already pointed out the doctrine of natural justice consists principally of two rules namely nemo debt esse judex propria cause no one shall be a judge in his own cause and audi alteram partem no decision shall be given against a party without affording him a reasonable hearing What he urged was a very limited contention namely that having regard to the nature of the action involved in the impounding of a passport the audi alteram partem rule must be held to be excluded because if notice were to be given to the hol der of the passport and reasonable opportunity afforded to him to show cause why his passport should not be impounded he might immediately on the strength of the passport make good his exit from the country and the object of impounding the passport would be frustrated where the learned author says at page that in administrative law a prima facie right to prior notice and opportunity to be heard may be held to be excluded by implication where an obligation to give notice and opportunity to be heard would obstruct the taking of prompt action especially action of a preventive or remedial nature Now it is true that since the right to prior notice and opportunity of hearing arises only by implication from the duty to act fairly or to use the words of Lord <NAME> of <ORG> from fair play in action it may equally be excluded where having regard to the nature of the action to be taken its object and purpose and the scheme of the relevant statutory provision fairness in action does not demand its implication and even warrants its exclusion There are certain well recognised exceptions to the audi alteram partem rule established by judicial decisions and they are summarised by <NAME> in Judicial Review of Administrative Action nd ed The word exception is really a misnomer because in these exclusionary cases the audi alteram partem rule is held inapplicable not by way of an exception to fair play in action but because nothing unfair can be inferred by not affording an opportunity to present or meet a case The audi alteram partem rule is intended to inject justice into the law and it cannot be applied to defeat the ends of justice or to make the law lifeless absurd stultifying self defeating or plainly contrary to the common sense of the situation Since the life of the law is not logic but experience and every legal proposition must in the ultimate analysis be tested on the touchstone of pragmatic realism the audi alteram partem rule would by the experiential test be excluded if importing the right to be heard has the effect of paralysing the administrative process or the need for promptitude or the urgency of the situation so demands But at the same time it must be remembered that this is a rule of vital importance in the field of administrative law and it must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional circumstances where compulsive necessity so demands It is a wholesome rule designed to secure the rule of law and the court should not be too ready to eschew it in its application to a given case True rue it is that in questions of this kind a fanatical or doctrinaire ap proach should be avoided but that does not mean that merely because the traditional methodology of a formalised hearing may have the effect of stultifying the exercise of the statutory power the audi alteram partem should be wholly excluded The court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent permissible in a given case The audi alteram partem rule is not cast in a rigid mould and judicial decisions establish that it may suffer situational modifications The core of it must however remain namely that the per on affected must have a reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty public relations exercise This circumstantial flexibility of the audi alteram partem rule was empbasised by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> supra when he said that he would be sorry to see this fundamental general principle degenerate into a series of hard and fast rules and Lord <NAME> also observed in Pearl Berg Party that the courts have taken in increasingly sophisticated view of what is required in individual cases <ORG> may proceed to impound the passport without giving any prior opportunity to the person concerned to be heard but as soon as the order impounding the passport is made and opportunity of hearing remedial in aim should be given to him so that he may present his case and controvert that of <ORG> and point out why his passport should not be impounded and the order impounding it recalled Is Section violative of Article That takes us to the next question whether section is violative of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution The argument tinder this head of challenge was that section confers unguided and unfettered power on <ORG> to impound a passport and hence it is violative of the equality clause contained in Article Moreover it was said that when the order impounding a passport is made by <ORG> there is no appeal or revision provided by the Statute and the decision of <ORG> that it is in public interest to impound a passport is final and conclusive There are four grounds set out in section which would justify the making of an order impounding a passport The words in the interests of the general public have a clearly well defined meaning and the courts have often been called upon to decide whether a particular action is in the interests of the general public or in public interest and no difficulty has been experienced by the <ORG> in carrying out this exercise Moreover it must be remembered that the exercise of this power is not made dependent on the subjective opinion of <ORG> as regards the necessity of exercising it on one or more of the grounds stated in the section but <ORG> is required to record in writing a brief statement of reasons for impounding the passport and save in cer tain exceptional circumstances to supply a copy of such statement to the person affected so that the person concerned can challenge the decision of <ORG> in appeal and the appellate authority can examine whether the reasons given by <ORG> are correct and if so whether they justify the making of the order impounding the passport It is true that when the order impounding a passport is made by <ORG> there is no appeal against it but it must be remembered that in such a case the power is exercised by <ORG> itself and it can safely be assumed that <ORG> will exercise the power in a reasonable and responsible manner And in any event if there is abuse of power the arms of the court are long enough to reach it and to strike it down The power conferred on <ORG> to impound a passport under section cannot therefore be regarded as discriminatory and it does not fall foul of Article But every exercise of such power has to be tested in order to determine whether it is arbitrary or within the guidelines provided in Section The argument which arose for consideration in this case was that the preventive detention order results in the detention of the applicant in a cell and hence it contravenes the fundamental rights guaranteed under clauses a and of Article This argument was negatived by <NAME> who pointed out that The true approach is only to consider the directness of the legislation and not what will be the result of the detention otherwise valid on the mode of the detenu life Any other construction put on the article will be unreasonable There the detention of the petitioner was ordered with a view to preventing him from making any speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and the argument was that the order of detention was invalid as it infringed the right of free speech and expression guaranteed under Article a The Court took the view that the direct object of the order was preventive detention and not the infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression which was merely consequential upon the detention of the detenu and upheld the validity of the order The decision in <NAME> case followed by <NAME> case gave rise to the theory that the object and form of <ORG> action determine the extent of protection which may be claimed by an individual and the validity of such action has to be judged by considering whether it is directly in respect of the subject covered by any particular article of the Constitution or touches the said article only incidentially or indirectly The test to be applied for determining the constitutional validity of <ORG> action with reference to fundamental rights is what is the object of the authority in taking the action what is the subject matter of the action and to which fundamental right does it relate to sustain an order made by <ORG> in a suit for defamation prohibiting the publication of the evidence of a witness But it is interesting to note that despite the observations of <ORG> in <NAME> case and the approval of these observations in <NAME> case there were two decisions given by this <ORG> prior to <NAME> case which seemed to deviate and strike a different note Since the direct and immediate effect of the order would be to restrain a newspaper from publishing any number of pages for carrying its news and views which it has a fundamental right under Article a to do unless it raises the selling price as provided in the Schedule to the Order it was held by this Court that the order was violative of the right of the newspapers guaranteed by Article a It may be pointed out that this doctrine is in sub stance and reality nothing else than the test of pith and substance which is applied for determining the constitutionality of legislation where there is conflict of legislative powers conferred on Federal and <ORG> Legis latures with reference to legislative Lists Here also on the application of this doctrine the question that is required to be considered is what is the pith and substance of the action of the <ORG> or in other words what is its true nature and character if it is in respect of the subject covered by any particular fundamental right its validity must be judged only by reference to that fundamental right and it is immaterial that it incidentally affects another fundamental right recognised the likeness of this doctrine to the pith and substance test and pointed out that the pith and substance test although not strictly appropriate might serve a useful purpose in determining whether the <ORG> action infringes a particular fundamental right But in <NAME> case which was a decision given by <ORG> consisting of eleven judges this doctrine was thrown overboard and it was pointed out by <NAME> speaking on half of the majority it is not the object of the authority making the law impairing the right of a citizen nor the form of action that determines the protection he can claim it is the effect of the law and of the action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to grant relief we are of the view that the theory that the object and form of the <ORG> action determine the extent of protection which the aggrieved party may claim is not consistent with the constitutional scheme In our judgment the assumption in <NAME> case that certain articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and in determining whether there is infringement of the individual guaranteed rights the object and the form of the <ORG> action alone need be considered and effect of the laws on fundamental rights of the indivi duals in general will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct The decision in <NAME> case thus overturned the view taken in <NAME> case and as pointed out by <NAME> speaking on behalf of the majority in <NAME> case it laid down two interrelated propositions namely First it is not the object of the authority making the law impairing the right of the citizen nor the form of action that determines the invasion of the right The decision in <NAME> case followed upon <NAME> case and it is an important and significant decision since it elaborated and applied the thesis laid down in <NAME> case The <ORG> action which was impugned in <NAME> case was newsprint policy which inter alia imposed a maximum limit of ten pages for every newspaper but without permitting the newspaper to increase the number of pages by reducing circulation to meet its requirement even within the admissible quota The subject matter of the import policy was rationing of imported commodity and equitable distribution of newsprint and the newsprint policy did not directly and immediately deal with the right mentioned in Article a and hence there was no violation of that Article Article could not have such law if the restriction is unreasonable even if it is related to matters mentioned therein The majority took the view that it was not the object of the newsprint policy or its subject matter which was determinative but its direct consequence or effect upon the rights of the newspapers and since the effect and consequence of the impugned policy upon the newspapers was direct control and restriction of growth and circulation of newspapers the newsprint policy infringed freedom of speech and expression and was hence violative of Article a But there can be no doubt on a reading of the relevant observations of <NAME> that such was the test really intended to be laid down by the <ORG> in that case If the test were merely of direct or indirect effect it would be a openended concept and in the absence of operational criteria for judging directness it would give the <ORG> an unquantifiable discretion to decide whether in a given case a consequence or effect is direct or not This criterion helps to quantify the extent of directness necessary to constitute infringement of a fundamental right is direct and inevitable then a fortiori it must be presumed to have been intended by the authority taking the action and hence this doctrine of direct and inevitable effect has been described by some jurists as the doctrine of intended and real effect Is Section violative of Article a or We may now examine the challenge based on Article a in the light of this background These were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to consider them A Is Freedom of speech and expression confined to the Territory of India The first question that arises for consideration on these contentions is as to what is the scope and ambit of the right of free speech and expression conferred under Article a Then are we going to supply these words and narrow down the scope and ambit of a highly cherished fundamental right Let us not forget that what we are expounding is a constitution and what we are called upon to interpret is a provision conferring a fundamental right Moreover it may be noted that only a short while before the Constitution was brought into force and whilst the constitutional debate was still going on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by <ORG> on th December and most of the fundamental rights which we find included in Part III were recognised and adopted by <ORG> as the inalienable rights of man in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article of the Universal Declaration declared that every one has a right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and import information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers We have therefore no doubt that freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article a is exercisable not only in India but outside It is true that the right of free speech and expression enshrined in Article a can be enforced only if it sought to be violated by any action of the <ORG> and since <ORG> action cannot have any extra territorial operation except perhaps incidentally in case of Parliamentary legislation it is only violation within the territory of India that can be complained of by an aggrieved person It is obvious that the right of free speech and expression guaranteed under Article a can be subjected to restriction permissible under Article Take for example a case where either under the Passports Act or as a condition in the Passport issued under it an arbitrary unreasonable and wholly unjustifiable restriction is placed upon the citizen that he may go abroad but he should not make any speech there He would be entitled to say that such a restriction imposed by <ORG> action is impermissible under Article and is accordingly void as being violative of Article a SCI It would thus seem clear that freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article a is exercisable not only inside the country but also outside There is also another consideration which leads to the same conclusion This cannot be done by the <ORG> under Article unless there is a law authorising the <ORG> to do so and the action is taken in accordance with the procedure prescribed by such law The right to go abroad and in particular to a specified country is clearly right to personal liberty exercisable outs de India and yet it has been held in <NAME> case to be a fundamental right protected by Article This clearly shows that there is no underlying principle in the Constitution which limits the fundamental rights in their operation to the territory of India There is an interesting article on The Constitutional Right to Travel in <ORG> where <NAME> writes The final objection to limitation upon the right to travel in that they interfere with the individual freedom of expression There are no geographical limitations to the Bill of Rights it is obvious therefore that there are no geographical limitations to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed Under Article a and this freedom is exercisable not only in India but also outside and if State Federal Reporter This conclusion would on a parity of reasoning apply equally in relation to the fundamental right to practice any profession or to carry any occupation trade or business guaranteed under Article Is the right to go abroad covered by Article a or That takes us to the next question arising out of the second limb of the contention of the Government Is the right to go abroad an essential part of freedom of speech and expression so that whenever there is violation of the former there is impairment of the latter involving infraction of Article a The argument of the petitioner was that while it is true that the right to go abroad is not expressly included as a fundamental right in any of the clauses of Article its existence is necessary in order to make the express freedoms mentioned in Article meaningful and effective The right of free speech and expression can have meaningful content and its exercise can be effective only if the right to travel abroad is ensured and without it freedom of speech and expression would be limited by geographical constraints The impounding of the passport of a person with a view to preventing him from going abroad to communicate his ideas or share his thoughts and views with others or to express himself through song or dance or other forms and media of expression is direct interference with freedom of speech and expression We shall examine these decisions a little later but let us first consider the question on principle Does it mean that on that account it cannot be a fundamental right covered by Article Now it may be pointed out at the outset that it is not our view that a right which is not specifically mentioned by name can never be a fundamental right within the meaning of Article If democracy means government of the people by the people it is obvious that every citizen must be entitled to participate in the democratic process and in order to enable him to intelligently exercise his right of making a choice free and general discussion of public matters is absolutely essential Thus freedom of the press constitutes one of the pillars of democracy and indeed lies at the foundation of democratic Organisation and yet it is not enumerated in so many terms as a fundamental right in Article though there is a view held by some constitutional jurists that this freedom is too basic and fundamental not to receive express mention in Part III of the Constitution But it has been held by this Court in several decisions of which we may mention only three namely <ORG> case <ORG> case and <ORG> case that freedom of the press is part of the right of free speech and expression and is covered by Article a The contrary construction would lead to incongruous results and the entire scheme of Article which confers different rights and sanctions different restrictions according to different standards depending upon Every travel abroad is not an exercise of right of free speech and expression and it would not be correct to say that whenever there is a restriction on the right to go abroad ex necessitae it involves violation of freedom of speech and expression This decision was not concerned with the validity of any legislation regulating issue of passports nor did it recognise the right to travel as founded on the first Amendment which protects freedom of speech petition and assembly The second decision on which reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner was <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> The question Which arose for determination in this case related to the constitutional validity of section of the Subversive Activities Control Act This section prohibited the use of passports by communists following a final registration order by <ORG> under section and following the mandate of this section the <ORG> Department revoked the existing passports of the appellants After exhausting all administrative remedies the appellants sued for declarative and injunctive relief before <ORG> which upheld the validity of the section <ORG> noted first that the right to travel abroad is an important aspect of the citizens liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and section substantially restricts that right and then proceeded to apply the strict standard of judicial review which it had till then applied only in cases involving the socalled preferred freedoms of the first Amendment namely that a governmental purpose may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms But this observation also cannot help because the right to foreign travel was held to be a right arising not out of the first Amendment but inferentially out of the liberty guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment and this observation was meant only to support the tension of the strict First Amendment test to a case involving the right to go abroad The majority took the view that freedom of movement was a right protected by the liberty clause of the Fifth Amendment and that the Secretary of <ORG> was justified in attempting to avoid serious international incidents by restricting travel to Cuba and summarily rejected <NAME> contention that the passport denial infringed his First Amendment rights by preventing him from gathering first band knowledge about Cuban situation Since reliance was placed only on the opinion of Justice <NAME> we may confine our attention to that opinion He pointed out The right to know to converse with others to consult with them to observe social physical political and other phenomena abroad as well as at home gives meaning and substance to freedom of expression and freedom of the press The majority rightly pointed out that in <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> there was direct interference with freedom of association by refusal to validate the passport since the appellant was required to give up membership of the <ORG> if he wanted validation of the passport Justice <NAME> also did not regard the right to travel abroad as a First Amendment right but held that it is peripheral to the enjoyment of First Amendment guarantees because it gives meaning and substance to the First Amendment rights and without it these rights would suffer That is why he observed towards the end that restrictions on the right to travel should be so particularised that a First Amendment right is not precluded or in other words there is no direct infringement of a First Amendment right We cannot therefore accept the theory that a peripheral or concomitant right which facilitates the exercise of a named fundamental right or gives it meaning and substance or makes its exercise effective is itself a guaranteed right included within the named fundamental right This much is clear as a matter of plain construction but apart from that there is a decision of this <ORG> which clearly and in so many terms supports this conclusion If a dispute was pending and a question was raised whether any amount from the reserves or other provisions should be taken into account by a tribunal the tribunal could refer the matter to <ORG> whose certificate as to the amount which could be taken into account was made final and conclusive Now it was conceded that section A did not prevent the workmen from forming unions or place any impediments in their doing so but it was contended that the right to form association protected under Article carried with it a guarantee that the association shall effectively achieve the purpose for which it was formed without interference by law except on grounds relevant to the preservation of public order or morality set out in Article The <ORG> said that unions were not restricted to workmen that employers unions may be formed in order to earn profit and that a guarantee for the effective functioning of the unions would lead to the conclusion that restrictions on their right to earn profit could be put only in the interests of public order or morality The restrictions which could be imposed on the right to form an association were limited to restrictions in the interest of public order and morality Again an association of workmen may claim the right of collective bargaining and the right to strike yet the right to strike could not by implication be treated as part of the right to form association for if it were so treated it would not be possible to put restrictions on that right in the public interest as is done by the Industrial Disputes Act which restrictions would be permissible under Article but not under Article The Court therefore held that the right to form unions guaranteed by Article does not carry with it a concomitant right that the unions so formed should be able to achieve the purpose for which they are brought into existence so that any interference with such achievement by law would be unconstitutional unless the same could be justified under Article The right to go abroad cannot therefore be regarded as included in freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article a on the theory of peripheral or concomitant right So also for the same reasons the right to go abroad cannot be treated as part of the right to carry on trade business profession or calling guaranteed under Article But that does not mean that an order made under section may not violate Article a or While discussing the constitutional validity of the impugned order impounding the passport of the petitioner we shall have occasion to point out that even where a statutory provision empowering an authority to take action is constitutionally valid action taken under it may offend a fundamental right and in that event though the statutory provision is valid the action may be void International flying is his profession and if his passport is impounded it would directly interfere with his right to carry on his profession and unless the order can be justified on the ground of public interest under Article it would be void as offending Article We have taken these two examples only by way of illustration Now passport can be impounded under section if <ORG> deems it necessary so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of India friendly relations of India with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public Therefore when an order is made under section which is in conformity with the terms of that provision it would be in the interests of the general public and even if it restricts freedom to carry on a profession it would be protected by Article But if an order made under section restricts freedom of speech and expression it would not be enough that it is made in the interests of the general public India with any foreign country it would satisfy the requirement of Article There can be no doubt that the interests of public order decency or morality are interests of the general public and they would be covered by section but the expression interests of the general public is as already pointed out a much wider expression and therefore in order that an order made under section restricting freedom of speech and expression may not fall foul of Article a it is necessary that in relation to such order the expression interests of the general public in section must be read down so as to be limited to interests of public order decency or morality If an order made under section restricts freedom of speech and expression it must be made not in the interests of the general public in a wider sense but in the interests of public order decency or morality apart from the other three categories namely interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of India and friendly relations of India with any foreign country Constitutional validity of the impugned Order We may now consider in the light of this discussion whether the impugned Order made by <ORG> impounding the passport of the petitioner under section suffers from any constitutional or legal infirmity Another ground of challenge urged on behalf of the petitioner was that the impugned Order has the effect of placing an unreasonable restriction on the right of free speech and expression guaranteed to the petitioner under Article a as also on the right to carry on the profession of a journalist conferred under Article in as much as if seeks to impound the passport of the petitioner idefinitely without any limit of time on the mere likelihood of her being required in connection with <ORG> headed by Mr Justice <NAME> This ground of challenge was vehemently pressed on behalf of the petitioner and supplemented on behalf of <NAME> who intervened at the hearing of the writ petition but we do not think there is any substance in it It is true and we must straiglitaway concede it that merely because a statutory provision empowering an authority take action in specified circumstances is constitutionally valid as not being in conflict with any fundamental rights it does not give a carte blanche to the authority to make any order it likes so long as it is within the parameters laid down by the statutory provision Every order made under a statutory provision must not only be within the authority conferred by the statutory provision but must also stand the test of fundamental rights It is a basic constitutional assumption underlying every statutory grant of power that the authority on which the power is conferred should act constitutionally and not in violation of any fundamental rights The argument urged on behalf of the petitioners was that these clauses imposed unreasonable restrictions of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles and and in answer to this argument apart from merits a contention of a prelimi nary nature was advanced on behalf of the <ORG> that as the petitioners have not challenged the validity of the Essential Commodities Act and have admitted the power of <ORG> to make an order in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Act it is not open to the <ORG> to consider whether the law made by the <ORG> in making the non ferrous metal control order violates any of the fundamental rights under the Constitution It was urged that so long as the Order does not go beyond the provisions in section of the Act it must be held to be good and the consideration of any question of infringement of fundamental rights under the Constitution is wholly beside the point The learned Judge proceeded to state the reasons for rejecting this argument in the following words If there was any reason to think that section of the Act confers on <ORG> power to do anything which is in conflict with the constitution anything which violates any of the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution that fact alone would be sufficient and unassailable ground for holding that the section itself is void being ultra vires the Constitution may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce in to include a power to make such provisions even though they may be in contravention of the Constitution Such words have to be read by necessary implication in every provision and every law made by the <ORG> on any day after the Constitution came into force It is clear therefore that when section confers power to provide for regulation or prohibition of the production supply and distribution of any essential commodity it gives such power to make any regulation or prohibition in so far as such regulation and prohibition do not violate any fundamental rights granted by the Constitution of India Now even if an order impounding a passport is made in the interests of public order decency or morality the restriction imposed by it may be so wide excessive or disproportionate to the mischief or evil sought to be averted that it may be considered unreasonable and in that event if the direct and inevitable consequence of the Order is to abridge or take away freedom of speech and expression it would be violative of Article a and would not be protected by Article and the same would be the position where the order is in the interests of the general public but it impinges directly and inevitably on the freedom to carry on a profession in which case it would contravene Article without being saved by the provision enacted in Article What the impugned Order does is to impound the passport of the petitioner and thereby prevent her from going abroad and at the date when the impugned order was made there is nothing to show that the petitioner was intending to go abroad for the purpose of exercising her freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on her profession as a journalist It must be said in fairness to <ORG> that this was a very reasonable stand to adopt because in a democratic society governed by the rule of law it is expected of the Government that it should act not only constitutional and legally but also fairly and justly towards the citizen It is bound to have some material before it on the basis of which it comes of a decision that there is a definite matter of public importance which needs to be inquired into and appoints <ORG> for that purpose It is possible that ultimately when <ORG> proceeds further with the probe it may find that the presence of the petitioner is not required but before that it would only be in the stage of likelihood and that can legitimately be left to the judgment of the central Government It was not disputed on behalf of the <ORG> and indeed it could not be in view of section sub section that save in certain exceptional cases of which this was admittedly not one <ORG> is bound to give reasons for making an order impounding a passport and though in the present case <ORG> initially declined to give reasons claiming that it was not in the interests of the general public to do so it realised the utter untenability of this position when it came to file the affidavit in reply and disclosed the reasons which were recorded at the time when the impugned order Was passed These reasons were that according to <ORG> the petitioner was involved in matters coming within the purview of <ORG> constituted by the Government of India to inquire into excesses committed during the emergency and in respect of matters concerning <ORG> and its associate companies and <ORG> was of the view that the petitioner should be available in India to give evidence before <ORG> and she should have an opportunity to present her views before them and according to a report received by <ORG> on that day there was likelihood of her leaving India The argument of the petitioner was that these reasons did not justify the making of the impugned Order in the interests of the general public since these reasons had no reasonable nexus with the interests of the general public within the meaning of that expression as used in section This argument is plainly erroneous as it seeks to cut down the width and amplitude of the expression interests of the general public an expression which has a well recognised legal connotation and which is to be found in Article as well as article It seeks to rely on the maxim expressio unius exclusio ulterius and proceeds on the basis that clauses and of section are exhaustive of cases where a person is required in connection with a proceeding whether before a court or <ORG> and no resort can be had to the general power under section in cases where a person is required in connection with a proceeding before <ORG> Section deals with a case where proceedings are pending before a criminal court while section contemplates a situation where a warrant or summons for the appearance or a warrant for the arrest of the holder of a passport has been issued by a court or an order prohibiting the departure from India of the holder of the passport has been made by any such court It is true that this is a rather drastic power to interfere with a basic human right but it must be remembered that this power has been conferred by the legislature in public interest and we have no doubt that it will be sparingly used and that too with great care and circumspection and as far as possible the passport of a person will not be impounded merely on the ground of his being required in connection with a proceeding unless the case is brought within section or section We must also deal with one other contention of the petitioner though we must confess that it was a little difficult for us to appreciate it Then it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the Minister for External Affairs who made the impugned Order on behalf of <ORG> did not apply his mind and hence the impugned Order was bad It has been stated in the affidavit in reply that the Minister for External Affairs applied his mind to the relevant material and also to the confidential information received from the intelligence sources that there was likelihood of the petitioner attempting to leave the country and then only he made the impugned Order This note of <ORG> was considered by the Minister for External Affairs and despite the suggestion made in this note the passports of only eleven persons out of those mentioned in the list were ordered to be impounded and no action was taken in regard to the passport of the petitioner It is only on st July when the Minister for External Affairs received confidential information that the petitioner was likely to attempt to leave the country that after applying his mind to the relevant material and taking into account confidential information he made the impugned Order We do not therefore see any reason to interfere with the impugned Order made by the Central Government In view of the statement made by the learned Attorney General to which reference has already been made in the judgment we do not think it necessary to formally interfere with the impugned order But in another sense not where the vires of a law which arms <ORG> with wide powers of potentially imperilling some of the life giving liberties of the people in a pluralist system like ours is under challenge and more so when the ground is virgin and the subject is of growing importance to more numbers as Indians acquire habits of trans national travel and realise the fruits of foreign tours reviving in modem terms what our forbears effectively did to put Bharat on the cosmic cultural and commercial map As we saw the reasons which the learned Attorney General so unhesitatingly disclosed the question arises wherefore are these things hid The catch all expression public interest is sometimes the easy temptation to cover up from the public which they have a right to know which appeals in the short run but avenges in the long run Since the only passport to this <ORG> jurisdiction in this branch of passport law is the breach of a basic freedom what is the nexus between a passport and a Part Ill right What are the ambience and amplitude the desired effect and direct object of them key provisions of the Passports Act Do they crib or cut down unconstitutionally any of the guarantees under Arts No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law It was the two way traffic of which there is testimony inside in Nalanda and outside even in Ulan Bator The mystic chords of ancient memory and the modern strands of the earth indivisibility the pathology of provincialism feudal backwardness glaring inequality Ind bleeding communalism the promotion of tourism of giving and taking know <NAME> how of studying abroad and inviting scholars from afar these and other realistic considerations gave tongue to those hallowed human rights fortified by the impregnable provisions of Part The right of free movement includes the right to travel abroad Then there are reasons chose to the core of personal life marriage reuniting families spending hours with old friends Basically <ORG> is still current coin Personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion of changing direction or moving one person to whatever place one own inclination may desire Now to procedure established by law the manacle clause in Art Again I observe relative brevity because I go the whole bog with brother <NAME> If Article includes the freedom of foreign travel can its exercise be fettered or forbidden by procedure established by law Yes indeed Procedure established by law with its lethal potentiality will reduce life and liberty to a precarious plaything if we do not ex necessitate import into those weighty words an adjectival rule of law civilised in its soul fair in its heart and fixing those imperatives of procedural protection absent which the processual tail will wag the substantive head specifically spells out the procedural safeguards for preventive and punitive detention a law providing for such detentions should conform to Art lm Had the question been res integra some of us would have been inclined to agree with the dissenting view expressed by <NAME> Gopalan does contain some luscent thought on Procedure established by law The learned Judge observed On the other hand the interpretation suggested by the Attorney General on behalf of the intervener that the expression means nothing more than procedure prescribed by any law made by a competent legislature is hardly more acceptable Established according to him means prescribed and if <ORG> or the <ORG> enacted a proce dure however novel and ineffective for affording the accused person a fair opportunity of defending himself it would be sufficient for depriving a person of his life of personal liberty The main difficulty I feel in accepting the construction suggested by the Attorney General is that it completely stultifies article and indeed the very conception of a fundamental right could it then have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution that the most important fundamental rights to life and personal liberty should be at the mercy of legislative majorities as in effect they would if established were to mean merely prescribed In other words as an American Judge said in a similar context does the constitutional prohibition in article amount to no more than your shall not take away life or personal freedom unless you choose to take it away which is more verbiage It is said that article affords no protection against competent legislative action in the field of substantive criminal law for there is no provision for judicial review on the ground of reasonableness or otherwise of such laws as in the case of the rights enumerated in article Even assuming it to be so the construction of the learned Attorney Genera would have the effect of rendering wholly ineffective and illusory even the procedural protection which the article was undoubtedly designed to afford emphasis added After giving the matter my most careful and anxious consideration I have come to the conclusion that there are only two possible solutions of the problem In the first place a satisfactory via media between the two extreme positions contended for on either side may be found by stressing the word established which implies some degree of firmness permanence and general acceptance while it does not exclude origination by statute and read into it those essentials of natural justice which made processual law humane The teamed Judge argued It seems to me that there is nothing revolutionary in the doctrine that the words Procedure established by law must include the four principles set out in Professor <NAME> book which as I have already stated are different aspects of the same principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about them These principles as the learned author points out and as the authorities show are not absolutely rigid principles but are adaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits <NAME> struck a concordant note Article in my opinion lays down substantive law as giving protection to life and liberty in as much as it says that they cannot be deprived except according to the procedure established by law in other words it means that before a person can be deprived of his life or liberty as a condition precedent there should exist some substantive law conferring authority for doing so and the law should further provide for a mode of procedure for such deprivation It further gives immunity against invalid laws which contravene the Constitution It gives also further guarantee that in its true concept there should be some form of proceeding before a person can be condemned either in respect of his life or his liberty It negatives the idea of a fantastic arbitrary and oppressive form of proceedings SCI In John Rees the true rule as implicit in any law is set down If there is any doubt the applicability of the principles will be given the benefit of doubt And Lord <NAME> on the theme of liberty observed in Schmidt Secretary of State Where a public officer has power to deprive a person of his liberty or his property the general principle is that it is not to be done without hearing clubs life with liberty and when we interpret the colour and content of procedure established by law we must be alive to the deadly peril of life being deprived without minimal processual justice legislative callousness despising hearing and fair opportunities of defence It was feebly suggested that the right to travel abroad cannot be guaranteed by the <ORG> because it has no extra territorial jurisdiction in foreign lands Be that as it may the law is now settled as I apprehend it that no article in Part III is an island but part of a continent and the conspectus of the whole part gives the directions and correction needed for interpretation of these basic provisions More importantly restraints are permissible only to the extent they have nexus with the approved object As a component thereof as also by way of separate submission it was urged that the direct effect of the passport law and refusal thereunder was not a blow on freedom of speech of association or of profession and therefore it could not be struck down even if it overflowed Art There are two ways of looking at the question as a facet of liberty and as an ancient of expression Nevertheless there are so many other aspects to travel abroad on functionally it requires such different types of regulation that at last as the general proposition it would have to be considered action The first amendment is still relevant in two ways There are sufficient elements of expression in travel abroad so that the umbrella effect of tile first Amendment comes into play thereby requiring the courts to apply due process and other constitutional doctrines with special care conditions imposed on travel abroad based on conduct classified as expression impair freedom of expression and hence raise direct first Amendment questions So far is plain sailing as I see it KAILASAM This petition is filed by Mrs <NAME> under Article of the Constitution of India against <ORG> and <ORG> for a writ of certiorari for calling for the records of the case including in particular the order dated July made by <ORG> under section of the Passports Act Act of impounding the passport of the petitioner and for quashing the said order The validity of the order was challenged on various grounds It was submitted that there was contravention of Art of the Constitution that principles of natural justice were violated that no opportunity of hearing as implied in section of the Act was given and that the with holding of the reasons for the order under section is not justified in law On July the petitioner prayed for an exparte ad interim order staying the operation of the order of the respondents dated July and for making the order of stay absolute after hearing the respondents It was stated in the counter affidavit that on May the Minister of External Affairs approved the impounding of the passport of persons and on May an order was passed by the Minister impounding the passports of persons out of persons that on July the authorities concerned informed the Ministry of Ex ternal Affairs that the petitioner and her husband had arrived at Bombay on the after noon of July and that information bad been received that there was likelihood of the petitioner leaving the country In the counter affidavit various allegations made in the petition were denied and it was stated that the order was perfectly justified and that the petition is without merits and should be dismissed According to the <ORG> the petitioner being the wife of <NAME> there was likelihood of the petitioner being questioned regarding some aspects of the <ORG> In the counter affidavit it was further alleged that there was good deal of evidence abroad and it would be unrealistic to over look the possibility of tampering with it or making it unavailable to the <ORG> which can be done more easily and effectively when an interested person is abroad So far as this allegation was concerned as it was not taken into account in passing the order it was given up during the hearing of the writ petition It was submitted that the petitioner was a journalist by profession and that she intended to proceed to West Germany in connection with her professional duties as a journalist and that by denying her the passport not only was her right to travel abroad denied but her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article were infringed The contention was that before an order passed under Article of the Constitution could be valid it should not only satisfy the requirements of that article namely that the order should be according to the procedure established by law but also should not in any way infringe on her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article It was contended that the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article particularly the right of freedom of speech and the right to practise profession was available to Indian citizens not only within the territory of India but also beyond the Indian territory and by preventing the petitioner from travelling abroad her right to freedom of speech and right to practise profession outside the country were also infringed The plea is that the fundamental rights guaranteed under article are available not only within territory of India but outside the territory of India as well The question that arises for consideration is whether the Fundamental Rights conferred under Part III and particularly the rights conferred under Article are available beyond the territory of India the rights conferred under Article a and are a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peacebly and without arms to form associations or unions to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business The rights conferred under Article and being limited in its operation to the territory of India the question of their extraterritorial application does not arise In order to decide this question I may consider the various provisions of the Constitution which throw some light on this point By the article India is constituted as a Democratic republic and its citizens secured certain rights Article of the Constitution defines the State as including the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the <ORG> of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of <ORG> Before that Article may be noticed which provides that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights The word law in the Article is defined as a law includes any Ordinance order bye law rule regulation notification custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law and laws in force includes laws passed or made by a <ORG> or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas In distributing the legislative powers between the <ORG> and the <ORG>s Article provides that <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the <ORG> of a <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the <ORG> Article provides that no law made by parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extra territorial operation The <ORG> has undoubted power to enact law having extra territorial application provides It is hereby declared and enacted that <ORG> has full power to make laws having extraterritorial operation But in determining whether the provisions of a Constitution or a statute have extra territorial application certain principles are laid down In <NAME> <ORG> <ORG> in dealing with the jurisdiction of <ORG> observed that English legislation is primarily territorial and it is no departure from that principle to say that a foreigner coming to this country and trading here and here committing an act of bankruptcy is subject to our laws and to all the incidents which those laws enact in such a case while he is here while he is trading even if not actually domiciled he is liable to be made a bank rupt like a native citizen Dealing with the extra territorial application of the provisions of the Income tax Act <ORG> in Governor General in Council <ORG> after finding that there was no territorial operation of the Act observed that if there was any extra territorial operation it is within the legislative powers given to <ORG> by the Constitution Act and holding that <ORG> powers for extra territorial legislation is not limited to the cases specified in clauses a to of sub section of section of the Government of India Act concluded by stating that the extent if any of extra territorial operation which is to be found in the impugned provisions is within the legislative powers given to <ORG> by the Constitution Act It was held that section of <ORG> Act conferred jurisdiction on the courtmartial to try non British subjects for offences committed by them beyond British India Repelling the contention that there was a presumption against construing even general words in an Act of <ORG> as intended to have extra territorial effect or authorising extra territorial legislation the <ORG> observed The passages relied on in this connection from Maxwell Interpretation of Statutes do not go the length necessary for the appeIlant case Whatever may be the rule of International Law as regards the ordinary citizen we have not been referred to any rule of International Law or principle of the comity of nations which is inconsistent with a <ORG> exercising dis ciplinary control over its own armed forces when those forces are operating outside its territorial limits Articles and can have only territorial application prima focie are applicable only to the territory of India At any rate there is no intention in these Articles indicating extra territorial application So also articles and which deal with cultural and educational rights are applicable only within the territory of India While it is possible that this right may have extra territorial application it is not likely that the framers of the Constitution intended the right to assemble peaceably and without arms or to form associations or unions or to acquire hold and dispose of property or to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business to have any extra territorial application for such rights could not be enforced by the <ORG> outside the Indian territory a and cannot be enforced by the <ORG> and in the circumstances there is a presumption that the Constitution makers would have intended to guarantee any right which the <ORG> cannot enforce and would have made a provision guaranteeing the rights and securing them by recourse to <ORG> and <ORG> The restriction of the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the right to reside and stay in any part of the territory of India is strongly relied upon as indicating that in the absence of such restrictions the other rights are not confined to the territory of India and i the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India have historical significance The intention was to avoid any restriction being placed by the <ORG>s hampering free movement In the two clauses and the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India the territory of India is mentioned with the purpose of preventing the States from imposing any restraint So also regarding the rights conferred under Articles and i to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business would not have been intended to be applicable outside India It was submitted that when the Constitution was framed the founding fathers were influenced by <ORG> Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was made in December and they thought it fit to make the Fundamental Rights available to the Indian citizens throughout the world Even in the American Constitution there is no mention of right to freedom of speech or expression as being available outside America While there is no restriction on the citizen to return to his own country <ORG> does place certain restrictions for leaving the country such as obtaining of the passports etc A passport is a request by the Government which grants it to a foreign Government that the bearer of the passport may pass safely and freely The First Amendment therefore provides that the people have the right to assemble peaceably and petition the government for redress of grievances to impose restrictions on the exercise of right of freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably without arms etc In the Penal Code under sections and the Act is made specifically applicable to crimes that are committed outside India by citizen of India Hence the question whether the State could impose such restraint does not arise in this case outside the country was infringed it became necessary to consider whether the citizen had any such right applies to laws made under Articles and and the citizen is entitled to challenge the validity of an Act made under Art on the ground that it affects the rights secured to him under cl of Art Article provides that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence It has been decided by this Court in Gopalan case that in the case of punitive detention for offences under the Penal Code it cannot be challenged on the ground that it infringes the right specified under Art <NAME> held If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of Art <NAME> <NAME> though he dissented from the majority view regarding the application of Article to punitive detention observed follows The Indian Penal Code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely Its primary object is to punish crime and not to restrict movement But if it the Punishment consists in imprisonment there is a restriction on movement This restraint is imposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining crime and making it punishable The punishment is correlated directly With the violation of some other person right and not with the right of movement possessed by the offender himself In my opinion therefore the Indian Penal Code does not come within the ambit of the words law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely Applying the same reasoning it is contended on behalf of the state that when a person is deprived of his life or personal liberty in accordance with the procedure established by law he cannot invoke to his aid any of the rights guaranteed under Art Article confers freedoms on the citizens whereas Aft though in a negative form the right to life and personal liberty is secured and the <ORG> can deprive it only according to the procedure established by law The learned Judge observed Article gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in the various clauses the restrictions that may be placed upon them by law so that they may not conflict with the public welfare or general morality On the other hand Articles and are primarily concerned with penal enactments or other law under which personal safety or liberty of persons would be taken away in the interest of society and the set down the limits within which the <ORG> control should be exercised the right to the safety of one life and limbs and to enjoyment of personal liberty in the sense of freedom from physical re strain and coercion of any sort are the inherent birth right The essence of these rights consists in restraining others from interfering with them and hence they cannot be described in terms of freedom to do particular things The words personal liberty take their colour from the words deprivation of rifle It means liberty of the person that is freedom from personal restraint According to <NAME> The right to personal liberty as understood in England means in substance a person right not to be subjected to imprisonment arrest or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification The framers of the Constitution thought that the word liberty should be qualified by the insertion of the word personal before it for otherwise it might be construed very widely so as to include even the freedoms already dealt with under Art The word personal liberty in Article is therefore confined to freedom from restraint of person and is different from other rights enumerated in Article of the Constitution It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that after the decision of the <ORG> case and <NAME> case the view taken earlier by <ORG> that in construing whether the deprivation of personal liberty is valid or not the enquiry should only be confined to the validity of the procedure prescribed without any reference to the rights conferred under Art The decisions bearing on this question may now be examined only applied where a legislation directly hit the rights enumerated in the Article and not where the loss of rights mentioned in the Article was a result of the operation of legislation relating to punitive or preventive detention It was also stated by Justice <NAME> that a law depriving the personal liberty must be a valid law which the legislature is competent to enact within the limits of the powers assigned to it and which does not transgress any of the Fundamental Rights the Constitution lays dawn Further the moment even this regulated freedom of the individual becomes incompatible with and threatens the freedom of the community the <ORG> is given power by article to deprive the individual of his life and personal liberty in accordance with procedure established by law subject of course to the provisions of Art Reality and substance test was laid down in this case while approving of the earlier decisions when the court was considering the question whether the ban on advertisement would affect the rights conferred under Art The learned counsel referred to the passage at page A Part where it was held that the correct approach in such cases should be to enquire as to what in substance is the loss or injury caused to a citizen and not merely what manner and method has been adopted by he <ORG> in placing the restriction and therefore the right to freedom of speech cannot be taken away with the object of taking away the business activities of the citizen The above observations relied on by the learned counsel were made in a petition where the validity of Delhi Newspapers Price and Page Order which fixed the maximum number of pages that might be published by a newspaper according to the price charged was questioned This decision does not help us in resolving the point at issue in this case for the court was concerned with the question whether the right of freedom of speech was directly affected by the impugned order In <NAME> case the majority took the view that the word liberty in Art In other words the <ORG> must satisfy that petitioners fundamental rights are not infringed by showing that the law only imposes reasonable restrictions within the meaning of Art The petitioners before <ORG> who held shares in some of the named banks or had accounts current or fixed deposits in the banks challenged the validity of the enactment of the Constitution the validity of the Ordinance and the Act was questioned on various grounds are not mutually exclusive and the law providing for acquisition of property for public purpose could be tested for its validity on the ground that it imposes limitation on the right to property which were not reasonable so tested the provision of the Act transferring undertaking of the named banks and prohibiting practically from carrying banking business violates the guarantee under Art and were mutually exclusive in their operation and that substantive provisions of law relating to acquisition of property were not liable to be challenged on the ground that it imposes unreasonable restrictions on the right to hold pretty and arises out of the limitations imposed on the authority of the <ORG> must also satisfy the requirements of Article and should be by a law which is within the competence of the legislature and does not impair the guarantee of the rights in part III including those conferred under Art The important question that arises for consideration is whether the decision in the <ORG> case has over ruled the decision of <NAME> case and is an authority for the proposition and an act of the legislature relating to deprivation of life and personal liberty should also satisfy the other fundamental rights guaranteed under Art In A <NAME> case supra <NAME> stated that if the capacity to exercise the right to property was lost because of lawful compulsory acquisition of the subject of that right the owner ceased to have that right for the duration of the incapacity pre supposes that the person to whom the fundamental right is guaranteed retains his property over or with respect to which alone that right may be exercised no restriction can be placed on the exercise of the right to acquire hold or dispose it of and as clause contemplates the placing of reasonable restrictions of the exercise of those rights it must follow that the Article postulates the existence of property over which the rights are to be exercised is liable to be tested on the ground that it violates other fundamental rights and freedoms including the right to bold property guaranteed by Art in so far as it imposes substantive restrictions enunciates the right to acquire hold and dispose of property cl of Art and and thereby relate to the right to property closely inter related cannot be overlooked for that formed the basis for the conclusion Article requires that property must be acquired for a public purpose and that it must be acquired After expressing its conclusion the <ORG> proceeded to state that it is found necessary to examine the rationale of the two lines of authority and determine whether there is anything in the Constitution which just fies this apparently inconsistent development of the law While stating that in its judgment the assumption in <NAME> case that certain articles exclusively deal with specific matters and in determining whether there is infringement of the individual guaranteed rights the ob ject and the form of <ORG> action alone need be considered and effect of laws on fundamental rights of the individuals in general will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct The view taken in <NAME> case that the objection and the form of <ORG> action has to be considered was over ruled and it was laid down that it is the effect and action upon the right of the person that attracts the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to grant relief It is no doubt true that certain passing observations have been made regarding the liberty of persons such as at page We have carefully considered the weighty pronouncements of the eminent judges who gave shape to the concept that the extent of protection of important guarantees such as the liberty of person and right to property depends upon the form and object of <ORG> action and not upon its direct operation upon the individual freedom Though the liberty of person is incidentally mentioned there is no further discussion on the subject are not mutually exclusive there is no justification for holding that the case and was not strictly necessary for the purpose of giving relief to the petitioner But it is necessary to state that the decision proceeded on some erroneous assumptions being a complete code relating to preventive detention the validity of an order of detention must be determined strictly according to the terms and within the four comers of that articles <NAME> at page of the judgment said The learned Attorney General contended that article clauses to formed a complete code of constitutional safeguards in respect of preventive detention and provided only these provisions are conformed to the validity of any law relating to preventive detention could not be challenged <NAME> in referring to the Attorney General argument at page stated that article has nothing to do with preventive detention at all and that preventive detention is wholly covered by article to which by themselves constitute a complete code If the obiter dicta based on the wrong assumption is to be taken as the correct position in law it would lead to strange results He said The Indian Penal Code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely In <NAME> case it was also pointed out by the Judges that art Before proceeding to consider the test of validity of a legislation as laid down in <NAME> case following the <ORG> case the decisions which followed the <ORG> case holding on the erroneous premises that the majority in <NAME> case held that Article was a self contained Code The view taken in this case also suffers from the same infirmities referred to in Later in the case of <NAME> West Bengal a Bench of four Judges again erroneously stated that <NAME> case had taken the view that Article was a complete Code After referring to the passage in <ORG> case the learned Judge observed It seems to me that <NAME> case was merely cited in <NAME> case for illustrating a line of reasoning which was held to be incorrect in determining the validity of law for the acquisition of property solely with reference to the provisions of Art It is seen that the view taken in the <ORG> case that a law relating to deprivation of life and personal liberty falling under Art With respect I agree with the view expressed by Chief Justice <NAME> and Justice <NAME> as be then was in <NAME> case Next to Bank Nationalisation case strong reliance was placed on <NAME> case by the petitioner for the proposition that the direct effect of the legislation of the fundamental rights is the test The <ORG> held that though Article a does not mention the freedom of press it is settled view of the <ORG> that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of press and circulation On the facts of the case there was no need to apply the doctrine of pith and substance It may be noted that in <NAME> case the question whether Articles and are mutually exclusive or not did not arise for consideration and the case cannot be taken as an authority for the question under consideration in the case These tests have been applied in several cases before the decision in Bank Nationalisation case The test laid down in <NAME> case is the direct operation on the rights of the person If the provisions comply with the requirements of Article that is if they comply with the procedure established by law the validity of the Act cannot be challenged If a passport is refused according to procedure established by law the plea that his other fundamental rights are denied cannot be raised if they are not directly infringed The <ORG> held the right to travel is part of personal liberty and a person could not be deprived of it except according to the procedure laid down by law This right to travel abroad is not absolute and is liable to be restricted according to the procedure established by law The decision has made it clear that personal liberty is not one of the rights secured under Article and therefore liable to be restricted by the legislature according to the procedure established by law Our Constitution provides for restriction of the rights by procedure established by law There must be some procedure and at least it must confirm to the procedure established by law must be taken to mean as the ordinary and well established criminal procedure that is to say those settled usages and normal modes of proceedings sanctioned by the Criminal Procedure Code which is a general law of Criminal procedure in the Country But as it is accepted that procedure established by law refers to statute law and as the legislature is competent to change the procedure the procedure as envisaged in the criminal procedure cannot be insisted upon as the legislature can modify the procedure <ORG> held in <NAME> case that Regulation clause of the Police Regulation which authorises domiciliary visits when there was no law on such a regulation violated Article I will not proceed to examine the provisions of Passport Act Act of to determine whether the Provisions of the Act are in accordance with the procedure established by law It may be remembered that this Act was passed after <ORG> had held in <NAME> that the right to tavel abroad is a part of person personal liberty of which he could not be deprived except in accordance with the procedure established by law in terms of Article of the Constitution If it is brought to the notice of the passport authority that a warrant or summons for the appearance or a warrant for the arrest of the holder of the passport or travel document has been issued by a court under any law for the time being in force or if an order prohibiting the departure from India of the holder of the passport or other travel document has been made by any such court and the passport authority is satisfied that a warrant or summons has been so issued or an order has been so made Section provides for an appeal by the aggrieved person against any order passed by the passport authority under several clauses mentioned in sub section of that section It is also provided that no appeal shall lie against any order passed by <ORG> Section provided that in disposing of an appeal the appellate authority shall follow such procedure as may be prescribed and that no appeal shall be disposed of unless the appellant has been given a reasonable opportunity of representing his case Rue of the Passport Rules prescribes that the appellate authority may call for the records of the case from the authority who passed the order appealed against and after giving the appellant a reasonable opportunity of representing his case pass final orders Except against an order passed by <ORG> the aggrieved person has a right of appeal The appellate authority is required to give a reasonable opportunity to the aggrieved person of representing his case It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that on a reading of section observance of rules of natural justice namely the right to be heard is implied and as the Government had failed to give an opportunity to the petitioner to explain her case the order is unsustainable In the alternative it was submitted that if section is construed as denying the petitioner an opportunity of being heard and by the provisions of section a right of appeal against an order passed by <ORG> is denied the provisions will not be procedure as established by law under Article and the relevant sections should be held ultra vires of the powers of the legislature It was contended that the power conferred on the authority to im pound a passport in the interests of general public is very vague and in the absence of proper guidance an order by the authority impounding the passport in the interests of general public without any explanation is not valid Under Section <ORG> is authorised to impound or revoke a passport on any of the grounds specified in clauses a to of sub section Under sub clause a passport may be impounded if it is brought to the notice of <ORG> that a warrant or summons for appearance of the holder of the passport has been issued by any court or if there is an order prohibiting departure from India of the holder of the passport has been made by a court It will be noticed that when action is contemplated under any of the clauses a and it is presumed that the authority will give notice for <ORG> cannot be satisfied under sub clause a that the holder is in wrongful possession thereof or under clause that he obtained the passport by suppression of material information Similarly under clause whether a person has been convicted by a court in India for any offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years can only be ascertained after hearing the holder of the passport These rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made They do not supplant the law but supplement it If a statutory provision can be read consistently With the principles of natural justice the courts should do so But if a statutory provision either specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application of any rules of natural justice then the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory authority and read into the concerned provision the principles of natural justice So also the right to be heard cannot be presumed when in the circumstances of the case there is paramount need for secrecy or when a decision will have to be taken in emergency or when promptness of action is called for where delay would defeat the very purpose or where it is expected To a limited extent it may be necessary te rovoke or to impound a passport without notice if there is real apprehension that the holder of the passport may leave the country if he becomes aware of any intention on the part of the passport authority or the <ORG> to revoke or impound the passport But that by itself would not justify denial of an opportunity to the holder of the passport to state his case before a final order is passed When the passport authority takes action under section he is required to record in writing a brief statement of reasons and furnish a copy to the holder of the passport on demand unless he for sufficient reasons considers it not desirable to furnish a copy An order thus passed is subject to an appeal where an appellate authority is required to give a reasonable opportunity to the holder of the passport to put forward his case There is a difference between an authority revoking or modifying an order already passed in favour of a person and initially refusing to grant a licence In <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> <ORG> Lord Denning observed that If his permit alien is revoked before the time limit expires he ought I think to be given an opportunity of making representation for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the permitted time Lord Denning extended the application of the rule of audi alteram partem even in the case of a foreign alien who had no right to enter the country Section in enumerating the several grounds on which the passport authority may impound a passport has used the words like if the authority is satisfied the authority deems it necessary to do so If it does not then the principle laid down in <NAME> <ORG> where <NAME> stated A long course of decision beginning with Dr <NAME> case and ending with some very recent cases establish that although there are no positive words in the statute requiring that the party shall be heard yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature In the circumstances there is no material for coming to the conclusion that the right to be heard has been taken away expressly or by necessary implication by the statute But the Attorney General in making the concession submitted that the rule will not apply when special circumstances exist such as need for taking prompt action due to the urgency of the situation or where the grant of opportunity would defeat the very object for which the action of impounding is to be taken This position is supported by the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Knaggs wherein it was stated it must however be borne in mind that there may be special circumstances which would satisfy a Governor acting in good faith to take action even if be did not give an opportunity to the person affected to make any relevant statement or to correct or controvert any relevant statement brought forward to his prejudice I am satisfied that the petitioner claim that she has a right to be heard before a final order under is passed is made out it was submitted on behalf of the state that an order under subclause is on the subjective satisfaction of <ORG> and that as the decision is purely administrative in character it cannot be questioned in a court of law except on very limited grounds Though the courts had taken the view that the principle of natural justice is inapplicable to administrative orders there is a change in the judicial opinion subsequently The rigid view that principles of natural justice applied only to judicial and quasi judicial acts and not to administrative acts no longer holds the field The views taken by the courts on this subject are not con sistent In this connection it is useful to quote the oft repeated observations of Lord Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Duke of Norfolk The requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case the nature of the inquiry the rules under which the tribunal is acting the subject matter that is being dealt with and so forth but whatever standard is adopted one essential is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case Benaim Lord Denning held that the view that the principle of natural justice applied only to judicial proceedings and not to administrative proceedings has been over ruled in <NAME> Baldwin The guidance that was given to the <ORG> was that they should follow the principles laid down in the case of immigrants namely that they have no tight to come in but they have a right to be heard The <ORG> held in construing the words the <ORG> Shall have regard only to the matter specified the <ORG> has a duty to act fairly and it must give the applicant an opportunity of satisfying them of the matter specified in the section In cases of immigrants though they had no right to come into the country it was held that they have a right to be heard These observations apply to the present case and the plea of the petitioner that the authority should act fairly and that they must let her know what their impressions are so that if possible she can disabuse them is sound prejudicially affected he must be given an opportunity to be heard and present his case If there is prima facie evidence on which a reasonable body of persons may hold that it is in the public interest to supply energy to consumers the requirements of the statute are fulfilled It was next contended on behalf of the petitioner that the provisions of of the Act which empowers <ORG> or the <ORG> to decline furnishing the holder of the passport a brief statement of the reasons for making an order if the authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India security of India friendly relations of India with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public is unsustainable in law In view of the construction which is placed on that the holder of the passport is entitled to be heard before the passport authority deems it necessary to impound a passport it cannot be said that there is total denial of procedure The authority under is bound to record in writing a brief statement of the reasons for making an order and furnish to the holder of the passport or travel docu Sup The grounds on which the authority may refuse to furnish the reasons are the same as provided in for impounding a passport but the two powers are exercisable in totally different contexts But that could only be an exception is indicated from the fact that the aggrieved person has a right of appeal under which has to be decided after giving a reasonable opportunity of representing his case But I am unable to say that a provision which empowers the authority to decline to furnish reasons for making the order is not within the competence of the legislature and no appeal is provided against the order of the <ORG> it would virtually amount to denial of procedure established by law as contemplated under Art Though there is considerable force in this submission In such cases it should be born in mind that when the <ORG> I feel that in the circumstances there is no justification for holding that of the Act is ultra vires of the powers of the legislature We have taken note of the fact that in the present case there is no reason in declining to furnish to the petitioner the statement of reasons for impounding the passport but such a lapse by the authority would not make sec <NAME> should have an opportunity to present her views before <ORG> and according to a report received there is likelihood of Smt Referring to where it is provided that when it is brought to the notice of the
