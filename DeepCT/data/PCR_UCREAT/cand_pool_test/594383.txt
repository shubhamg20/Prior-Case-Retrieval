stipulated contributions and had agreed a not to divulge to third parties without the consent of <ORG> any confidential information received under the agreement Article cl and without the written consent of <ORG> not to assign the benefit of the agreement or grant sub licences of the patents and trade marks of <ORG> Article IV cis and and had further agreed upon the termination of the

under the agreement merely the right to draw for the purpose of carrying on its business as a manufacturer and dealer of pharmaceutical products upon the technical knowledge of <ORG> for a limited period by making that technical knowledge available <ORG> did not part with any asset of its business nor did the assessee acquire any asset or advantage of an enduring nature for the benefit of its business revenue is not always determinative of the nature of the outgoing in the hands of the person who pays it Again the view expressed by the majority of the <ORG> does not lay down any principle which may be of value in deciding this case Lord <NAME> of Avonholm held that the amount in its enitrely was received by the assessee in the course of its trading activity and Lord Denning said that he could see no distinction between the money paid for disclosing information of secret processes and money paid for other information and that it was a single payment for know how in the course of the assessee trade and was on that account income and not capital but since there was no finding that it was received in the course of the existing trade which was being taxed it was not liable to be brought to tax In two later cases decided by the <ORG> of Lords <NAME> <ORG> and <NAME> <ORG> it was observed that in <ORG> case there was a total loss of the business of the company by the communication of secret processes to <ORG> and on that account the company parted with an asset against receipt of a capital sum There was also no attempt to part with the technical knowledge absolutely in favour of the assessee The following facts which emerge from the agreement clearly show that the secret processes were not sold by <ORG> to the assessee a the licence was for a period of five years liable to be terminated in certain eventualities even before the expiry of the period the object of the agreement was to obtain the benefit of the technical assistance for running the business the licence was granted to the assessee subject to rights ac tually granted or which may be granted after the date of the agreement to other persons the assessee was expressly prohibited from divulging confidential information to third parties without the con sent of <ORG> there was no transfer of the fruits of research once for all <ORG> which was continuously carrying on research and had agreed to make it available to the assessee and the stipulated payment was recurrent dependent upon the sales and only for the period of the We agree with <ORG> that the first question was rightly answered in favour of the assessee <NAME> and <ORG> England hereinafter called <NAME> and <NAME> who were also carrying on business as pharmaceutical manufacturers in India the two contracting companies mutually agreed to grant to one another a non exclusive licence in respect of sulphathiazol products in different countries including India <ORG> alleging that the latter had infringed the Indian patents of the plaintiff it was found necessary during the progress of the suit to amend the specifications of the patents In appeal <ORG> held that in the payment made by the assessee there was no capital element and the assessee incurred the expenditure in the course of its business and for the purpose of ensuring that the patents with which it was connected were not infringed <ORG> held that the assessee company was not responsible for the payment because the liability of <ORG> had not at any time devolved upon <ORG> prior to the transfer of the business in the pharmaceutical section to the assessee and since the assessee had undertaken the liability to satisfy discharge and pay all debts and liabilities of <ORG> and of no other person the assessee was not entitled to claim the amount paid to <ORG> as an allowable deduction The <ORG> has riot expressly so found and there is no evidence in support of that view
