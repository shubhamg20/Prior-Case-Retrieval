The facts necessary for the purposes of this appeal may be stated as follows On lst November a preliminary decree in a suit brought on the basis of a mortgage was passed in the following terms It is ordered that the claim of the plaintiff for the recovery of Rs On th January the plaintiff filed an application for preparation of a final decree under Order Rule Civil This application was opposed by the defendant on the ground of limitation Thereupon the plaintiff filed another application praying that in case the Court was of opinion that the application in respect of the entire decretal amount was barred by time a final decree in respect of instalments which were within time might be prepared The learned <NAME> before whom the applications came on for hearing reached the conclusion that the application for preparation of the final decree was within time so far as the instalments which fell due within three years prior to the date of the presentation of the application were concerned and he ordered preparation of the final decree accordingly The learned Civil Judge came to the conclusion that under the terms of the decree no option was conferred upon the plaintiff and consequently the entire decretal amount fell due on th December on which date the right to make an application for preparation of the final decree accrued to the plaintiff There can be no doubt that according to the terms of the preliminary decree on default of payment of the first three instalments the plaintiff acquired a right to make an application for the preparation of a final decree and if limitation is computed from the date upon which the third instalment fell due the application which has given rise to the present appeal would be beyond time In the decree we have no words like the creditor would be entitled to or the creditor would have the power to recover and the expression that the entire decretal amount shall be payable in a lump sum is imperative and is inconsistent with any option having been given to the plaintiff There is a current of authority in support of the view that the expression when the right to apply accrues means when the right to apply first accrues and this view is reinforced by the observations of their Lordships of <ORG> made in <NAME> <NAME> A I at where their Lordships remarked that If in the Indian cases the question were when did the mortgagee cause of action arise i when did he first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think that there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decisions If the terminus a quo be the date when the cause of action arises there is no doubt that it will be the date on which the plaintiff would first become entitled to sue and if the date when the cause of action arises is to be considered the first date when one becomes entitled to sue for the relief claimed by him then the date when he becomes entitled to apply is certainly the date when the right to apply by way of enforcing the default clause accrued to the mortgagee when on the first occasion there was a default It may be that in a particular case the plaintiff may not make an application on the first occasion that he became entitled to make one but that would not prevent the limitation running against him which depends upon the time of accrual of the right to make an application Limitation Act is applicable the time runs from the date the right to apply first accrues The provision which it makes is specific as regards the period of limitation but as regards the terminus a quo it is content to state in general language and quite simply the fundamental principle that for the purposes of any particular application time is to run from the moment at which the applicant first had the right to make it Reliance was also placed on behalf of the appellant on the case in <NAME> <NAME> A I Oudh That case is distinguishable upon the ground that there the preliminary decree conferred an option on the decree holder to obtain a final decree on default of any one instalment when the entire amount unpaid became payable If there is anything in the judgment of <ORG> which may be said to be in conflict with the view that the expression when the right to apply accrued means when the right to apply first accrues we dissent from that decision whether in a case where there is no option contained in the decree the limitation under Article for an application for preparation of a final decree runs from the date when the plaintiff becomes first entitled to make an application In our judgment the order passed by the learned Civil Judge is correct and we accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs
