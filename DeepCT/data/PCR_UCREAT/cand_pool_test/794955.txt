Enquiry was held by the Station Manager to whom the Appellant objected on the ground of bias An application under A was made on June by the appellant challenging the order of dismissal The appellant objected to the maintainability of the application for approval but the <ORG> accorded approval to the action taken by the respondent and dismissed the application of the appellant under A on appeal by special leave <NAME> further that in the absence of any positive action amounting to recognition of the appellant as a protected person by the respondent and the appellant had produced no such evidence he could not be held to be a protected workman for dismissing whom previous sanction was necessary under <NAME> further that the dismissal of the appellant did not amount to victimisation <NAME> also that even if the domestic enquiry was defective provided that there is a prima facie case for dismissal and a bonafide conclusion is reached that the employee is guilty of misconduct and if <ORG> in dealing with the application under and after considering for itself the evidence adduced before it gives its approval it would relate back to when the employer came to the conclusion after the enquiry that the dismissal is a proper punishment The judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by special leave challenges the order of <ORG> West Bengal relating to the dismissal of the appellant who was in the service of the respondent company The charge sheet contained two charges of gross dereliction of duty inasmuch as the appellant The appellant objected to the inquiry being held by Station Manager on the ground that the Station Manager was biased against him on account of the evidence which he had given against the Station Manager in a customs case which was partly responsi ble for the infliction of a fine on the Station Manager The same day the respondent filed an application before <ORG> West Bengal seeking approval of the action On June the appellant made an application under A of the Industrial Disputes Act NO XIV of hereinafter referred to as the Act challenging the legality of the action taken on a large number of grounds In particular dealing with the various points raised on behalf of the appellant <ORG> held that the application under of the Act was validly made even though it had been made after the order of dismissal had been passed It further held that the case was not covered by of the Act and it was not necessary to obtain the precious permission of the tribunal before dismissing the appellant Further as to the charge that the Station Manager was biased and therefore there was violation of the principles of natural justice <ORG> was of the view that the contention of the appellant that the Station Manager was biased against him because of the evidence he had given in the customs case could not be brushed aside lightly But it went on to hold that even if there was some violation of the principles of natural justice in as much as the Station Manager was biased against the appellant the respondent had adduced all the evidence before it in support of its action and it had to decide on that evidence whether the action was justified and approval should be granted Finally it came to the conclusion that the mistakes committed by the appellant were serious involving possible accident to the aircraft and possible loss of human life It was not prepared to accept the plea of over work and other pleas raised on behalf of the appellant to mitigate the mistakes committed by him A of the Act and accorded approval to the action taken by the respondent The main point which was raised in this appeal is now concluded by the decision of this Court in <ORG> Saharanpur <NAME> that case that the proviso to contemplates the three things mentioned therein namely i dismissal or discharges ii payment of wages and iii making of an application for approval to be simultaneous and to be part of the same transaction so that the employer when he takes the action under by dismissing or discharging an employee should immediately pay him or offer to pay him wages for one month and also make an application to the tribunal for approval at the same time The respondent also made the application under to the industrial tribunal the same day Learned counsel for the appellant has further raised some points which were raised on behalf of the appellant before <ORG> Besides <ORG> has pointed out that the mere fact that a letter was written to the Manager of the respondent company by the Vice President of the union in which the name of the appellant was mentioned as a joint secretary of the union and the manager had been requested to recognise him along with others mentioned in the letter as protected workmen would not be enough The company had replied to that letter pointing out certain legal defects therein and there was no evidence to show what happened thereafter Then it is urged that after <ORG> held that the Station Manager who held the inquiry was baised and there had been violation of the principles of natural On the other hand it has been urged on behalf of the respondent that the Station Manager could not in the circumstances of this case be said to have violated the principles of natural justice because the mistakes were admitted by the appellant and the inquiry was really formal and all that the Station Manager had to do was to recommend what he considered suitable punishment for the misconduct which had taken place There is some force in these contentions on behalf of the respondent in the circumstances of the present case It is now well settled by a number of decisions of this <ORG> that it is open to the tribunal to go into the propriety of an order of dismissal itself when there is a defect in the domestic inquiry In these circumstances even if it be held that the Station Manager was biased and therefore there was some violation of the principles of natural justice inasmuch as the inquiry was field by him <ORG> would be entitled to go into the question whether the dismissal was justified on the evidence led before it and this is exactly what <ORG> did relying on the judgment of this <ORG> in Phulbari Tea Estate We however find no reason to differ from the finding of <ORG> on the question of victimisation apart from the fact that a finding of victimisation is generally a question of fact and cannot be agitated in this Court <ORG> has pointed out that the plea of victimisation on the ground that there was some delay in giving the charge sheet to the appellant cannot be sustained because the Station Manager came to know about the mistakes only a few days before the charge sheet was given though the mistakes had actually been committed in January and March and also because the appellant admitted the mistakes and there could be no doubt therefore that he had committed them In this connection reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Messrs The present is a case where the employer has held an inquiry though it was defective and has passed an order of dismissal and seeks approval of that order If the inquiry is not defective <ORG> has only to see whether there was a prima facie case for dismissal and whether the employer had come to the bona fide conclusion that the employee was guilty of misconduct If the inquiry is defective for any reason <ORG> would also have to consider for itself on the evidence adduced before it whether the dismissal was justified <ORG> case on which the appellant relies apply only to a case where the employer had neither dismissed the employee nor had come to the conclusion that a case for dismissal had been made out There is no force in this appeal and it is hereby dismissed
