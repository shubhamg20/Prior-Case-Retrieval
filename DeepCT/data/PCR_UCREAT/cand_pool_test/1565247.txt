He prayed for quashing the letter of the <ORG> respondent No dated in which the seniority of un official respondent Nos to was fixed from the date of initial time scale DOITS in He also prayed for a direction to the petitioner to refix his DOITS in counting weightage of five years from the year of vacancy Aggrieved by the same respondent No again filed <ORG> No of before the Central <ORG> praying to quash the <ORG> letter dated wherein his seniority was fixed with effect from and for quashing the tetter dated of the Secretary <ORG> which was the basis for passing the order on by respondent No rejecting the representation made by the first respondent on The learned <ORG> allowed the <ORG> in the following terms In view of what is stated above we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the applicant should be shown as having been promoted to <ORG> in the vacancies that arose for promotion from Group to Group A service in the year If the principle laid down by the <ORG> is allowed to stand whenever there is delay in constitution of <ORG> the subsequent promotions in accordance with the recommendations of <ORG> would have to be dated back which would result in violation of Articles and of the Constitution of India Though there were vacancies in the petitioners did not hold <ORG> in relation to the vacancies whiclx arose in and respondent No was only considered in and therefore the petitioners are bound to give weightage of five years and refix the DOITS five years anterior to i In the light of the rival contentions presented before us the point that arises for consideration is whether the first respondent is entitled for weightage from the date of appointment to <ORG> of Group A of <ORG> with effect from or is he entitled for such weightage anterior to the year of allotment i Between these two dates there was no officer who was given DOITS with reference to which is now claimed by respondent No Principle i states that the seniority of officers appointed to class I shall be determined on the basis of date for increment on time scale DOITS to be specifically determined in each case in accordance with the principles laid down therein Principle ii is to the effect that all such officers promoted to class I shall count their seniority from the date they commence earning increments in the regular scale as Assistant Officers subject to condition that inter se seniority of officers in each service recruited as probationers in a particular year will be regulated by their place in order of merit Principle vii in the letter dated was renumbered as principle vi and after amendment it reads as follows Principle vi In the case of Group officers permanently promoted to Group A services if two or more officers are promoted on the same date their relative seniority will be in the order of selection subject to the aforesaid provision the seniority of officers permanently promoted from Group to Group A service shall be determined by giving weightage based on a the year of service connoted by the initial pay on permanent promotion to Group A service or half the total number of years of continuous service in Group both officiating and permanent whichever is more subject to a maximum of years provided that the weightage so assigned does not exceed the total non fortuitous service rendered by the officer in Group <ORG> allowed the OA and hence the appellants carried the matter to <ORG> <NAME> case supra involved the interpretation of <ORG> Regulation of Seniority Rules and the case was decided on the facts peculiar to it and no principle or ratio was laid down therein The relevant interpretation of the regulations is as under It must therefore held that in view of the provisions contained in Regulation unless there is a good reason for not doing so <ORG> is required to meet every year for the purpose of making the selection from amongst <ORG> Civil Service Officers who fulfil the conditions regarding eligibility on the first day of the January of the year in which the <ORG> meets and fall within the zone of consideration as prescribed in clause of Regulation It was held It is true that filling up of the posts are for clear or anticipated vacancies arising in the year It is settled law that mere inclusion of one name in the list does not confer any right on him her to appointment In <NAME> <NAME> of Bihar Supp SCC ATC it was held that mere inclusion of one name in the panel does not confer on him her any indefeasible right to appointment It is further held that the purpose of making a panel was to finalise the list of eligible candidates for appointment The preparation of the panel should be the exact to the notified or anticipated vacancies However in the light of the above principles and in the light of the clear rules extracted therein before it is seen that the exercise of preparation of the panel is undertaken well in advance to fill up the clear vacancies or anticipated vacancies The preparation and finalisation of the yearly panel unless duly certified by the appointing authority that no vacancy would arise or no suitable candidate was available is a mandatory requirement If the annual panel could not be prepared for any justifiable reason year wise panel of the eligible candidates within the zone of consideration for filling up the vacancies each year should be prepared and appointment made in accordance therewith This judgment of <ORG> refers to the principles of seniority contained in letter dated of <ORG> on two earlier cases and having regard to the principles laid down in the cases of <NAME> and <NAME> supra came to the conclusion that the principle of weightage which is also proposed by <ORG> in their letters was unassailable The decisions of <ORG> in <ORG> Maharashtra Vikrikar Karmachari Sanghatan and Shanmukham cases supra cited by petitioner Counsel did not deal with the principle of weightage while fixing seniority of the promotccs and they deal with the question of consideration of period of ad hoc promotion for the purpose of reckoning seniority and therefore it is not necessary to refer to these judgments <NAME> dealing with Indian Administrative Service Cadre Rules and IAS Fixation of Cadre Strength Regulations <ORG> held that even when the vacancy exists to be filled up by promotion from non cadre service holders the <ORG> is not bound to fill up those vacancies The question then arises whether there is any such right in the petitioners to seek such creation of additional posts It is a well settled principle in service jurisprudence that even when there is a vacancy the <ORG> is not bound to fill up such vacancy nor is there any corresponding right vested in an eligible employee to demand that such post be filled up The officers may have a legitimate expectation but they cannot have any enforceable right either to compel constitution of <ORG> or to seek promotion with retrospective date for valid reasons <ORG> may be postponed ii The principle of weightage has to be applied having regard to other principles of seniority and cannot be construed or applied in a straight jacket formula iii The principle of weightage has to be applied by giving due weightage of service of five years from the date of substantive appointment and not from the year of allotment iv The principle of giving weightage of five years from the date of substantive appointment is fair and equitable procedure and cannot be held to violate Articles and of the Constitution of India The principle of giving weightage subject to condition that weightage assigned shall not exceed the total non fortuitous service rendered by the officer in the lower category and vi If the principle of giving five years of weightage in service in the promoted category is reckoned with reference to year of allotment the same would violate the principle of equity in Articles and of the Constitution of India in that even a person whose claims were rejected earlier or who was not qualified or who was not within the zone of consideration would get the benefit of weightage of five years of service which is illogical and illegal In the result for the aforesaid reasons we allow the writ petition and dismiss OA No of filed by the first respondent herein
