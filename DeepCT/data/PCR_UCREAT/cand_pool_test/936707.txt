The appeal filed by the respondent with regard to issues Nos and formed the subject matter of cross objections in Civil Appeal No of The cross objections are the same which form grounds of appeal filed by the respondent in <ORG> at Allahabad against an order of dismissal of Civil Misc There are six clauses in Article A Under the second clause the validity of any such law as is referred to in clause and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court The third clause states that where any person is appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> while an election petition referred to in Article in respect of his election to either House of Parliament or as the case may be to <ORG> is pending such election petition shall abate upon such person being appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be being chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> but such election may be called in question under any such law as is referred to in clause The fourth clause which directly concern the present appeals states that no law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in clause to either House of <ORG> and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by any court before such commencement declaring such election to be void such election to be void such election continue to be valid in all respect and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of no effect The fifth clause states that any appeal or cross appeal against any such order of any court as is referred to in clause pending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act before <ORG> shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of clause The sixth clause states that the provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution In view of the challenge by the respondent to the constitutional validity of the Amendment Act and notice was given to the Attorney General In view of the Constitutional Thirty ninth Amendment Act which came into existence on August the hearing was adjourned till August It is said that there is no rational basis for differentiation between persons holding high offices and other persons elected to <ORG> These persons were not supplied any grounds of detention or given any opportunity of making a representation against their detention The mere fact that a person may be deprived of his right to move any court to secure his release from such illegal detention by means of a Presidential order under Article does not render the detention itself either legal or constitutional There is no such provision in our Constitution it is said that the <ORG> cannot exercise powers which are to be found in the other two departments of <ORG> which are normally legislative or powers which are generally executive in their nature it is stated that under constitutional provision conferring on the <ORG> the power to determine by law before what authority and in what manner the trial of contested elections shall be conducted the <ORG> is given broad power A constitutional provisions authorising the <ORG> to provide for the mode of contesting elections in all cases not otherwise specifically provided for in the Constitution itself confers on the <ORG> adequate authority to provide for all election contests and to determine where and by what means election contests shall be conducted <NAME> the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> was referred to in order to find out as to what aspects of elections would be justiciable and not a political question The court did not decide an election dispute but as a custodian of judicial power judged whether the <ORG> was acting within its power Provision is made in each case for constituting a rota from whom these judges are selected Reliance was placed on the decisions in <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> King Emperor that an amendment is supportable to invalidate a judgment <ORG> did not accept the contention on the ground that in India the <ORG> has enacted laws providing that suits which had been dismissed on a particular view of the law must be restored and retried If a competent court has found that a particular tax or levy has been imposed by a law which is void because the <ORG> passing the law was not competent to pass the law then the competent <ORG> has validated the tax or levy by a validation Act involving a re enactment of the invalid law One of the objects of that ordinance was to enact a presumption in the ordinance itself in favour of detention orders to preclude their being questioned in courts of law and to take away or limit the power of <ORG> to make orders under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code The third object of the ordinance was challenged on the ground that Section of the ordinance which provided that if at the commencement there is pending in any court any proceeding by which the validity of an order having effect by virtue of Section as if it had been made under this ordinance is called in question that proceeding is hereby discharged Section of the ordinance was challenged on the ground that this was in abrogation of judicial power by legislative authority The court held that there was no distinction between a disqualification decreed by the <ORG> on racial grounds and one alleged to violate the right of free speech In our Constitution there is separation of powers in a broad sense There is therefore no question of any separation of powers being involved in matters concerning elections and election petitions When the constituent power exercises powers the constituent power comprises legislative executive and judicial powers But in doing so the <ORG> takes into account factors relevant to individual properties There is no doubt that the constituent power is not the same as legislative power There is liberty to <ORG> to classify to establish equality Secondly it has deprived the right to raise a dispute about the validity of the election by not having provided another forum Third there is no judgment to deal with and no right or dispute to adjudicate upon If the election petition itself did not have any existence in law there was no petition which could be looked into by the constituent power If there was no petition to look into it is difficult to comprehend as to what norms were applied to the election dispute In the present case the constitutent power did not have any law to apply to the case because the previous law did not apply and no other law was applied by clause There is no discrimination if classification on rational basis is made for determination of disputes relating to persons holding the office of Prime Minister or the Speaker The changes effected by the Amendment Act and apply to all and there is no discrimination The constituent power can exercise judicial power but it has to apply law Clause in Article A states that an appeal against any order of any court referred to in Clause pending before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act before <ORG> shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of Clause None of the members of <ORG> were either supplied any grounds of detention or given any opportunity to make any representation against their detention The right of the detained members of <ORG> to move any court for the enforcement of their fundamental right under Article of the Constitution was taken away by the executive or The mere fact that a person who is under unconstitutional and illegal detention may be deprived of his right to move a court to secure his release from such illegal detention by means of a Parliament Order under Article is said by the respondent not to render the detention of a person either legal or constitutional and therefore such a detenu must be provided an opportunity to participate in the proceedings of the <ORG> <NAME> then brought an action against the Sergeant in order to obtain a declaration that the order of the <ORG> was beyond the power and jurisdiction of the <ORG> and void and an order restraining <NAME> from preventing <NAME> by force from entering the <ORG> When under Article the President during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency by order declares that the right to move any court for the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III shall remain suspended and persons who are members of <ORG> are in detention under orders made under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act the detention cannot be challenged by collateral attack on the ground of deprivation of their participation in the parliamentary proceedings No duty of informing the Speaker arises in the case of a person who while in prison under sentence of a court is elected as a member of <ORG> The <ORG> raised a preliminary objection that the petitions were incompetent in view of the order issued by the President under Article suspending the rights of any person to move any court for the enforcement of rights conferred by Articles and Articles and were considered in <NAME> case Supra in relation to rights of members of <ORG> and it was held that the totality of rights cannot claim the status of fundamental rights and freedom of speech on which reliance was placed is a part of the privileges falling under Article In Section A of the Indian Penal Code there was a proviso to the effect that candidate would mean a person who holds himself out as a prospective candidate provided he is subsequently nominated as a candidate Relying on the provisions introduced by the Amendment Act it is contended on behalf of the appellant that she will be regarded as a candidate only from February namely the date when she has been duly nominated as a candidate at her election and therefore the finding of <ORG> cannot be sustained It is also contended by the appellant that the finding of <ORG> that <NAME> delivered election speeches on January and January under instructions of the appellant cannot be supported because the appellant was not a candidate either on January or on January The Explanation is as follows For the purposes of clause notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the publication in the Official Gazette of the appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service of a person in the service of <ORG> including a person serving in connection with the administration of a Union territory or of a State Government shall be conclusive proof i of such appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service as the case may be and ii where the date of taking effect of such appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service as the case may be is stated in such publication also of the fact that such person was appointed with effect from the said date or in the case of resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service such person ceased to be in such service with effect from the said date The third finding by <ORG> that the appellant and her election agent <NAME> procured and obtained the assistance of the officers of <ORG> particularly the District Magistrate the Superintendent of Police the Executive Engineer <NAME> and the Engineer to <ORG> for construction of rostrums and arrangement for supply of power for construction of rostrums and arrangement for supply of power for loudspeakers and for their assistance for furtherance of the prospects of the election of the appellant has to be tested in the light of the provisions contained in Section of the Act The proviso is as follows Provided that where any person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of the classes aforesaid in the discharge or purported discharge of his official duty makes any arrangements or provides any facilities or does any other act or thing for to or in relation to any candidate or his agent or any other person acting with the consent of the candidate or his election agent whether by reason of the office held by the candidate or for other reason such arrangements facilities or act or thing shall not be deemed to be assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election The respondent has challenged the constitutional validity of these Acts on account payments made to the drivers of the vehicles <NAME> thereafter wrote a note to <NAME> and requested that the letter be sent to the District Election Officer to that effect By the Amendment Act a proviso has been added to Section of the Act to the effect that arrangements made or facilities provided or any act done by a government servant belonging to the class mentioned there in the discharge of official duty shall not be deemed to be assistance for furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election There is no pleading in the election petition that the appellant authorised incurring expenditure by a political party There is no pleading that any amount has been paid by the political party There is no complaint in the petition about the sum of Rs There is no evidence to identify any of these payments with the election of the appellant Explanation which was inserted at the end of Section of the Act by Amendment Act is that any expenditure incurred or authorised in connection with the election of a candidate by a political party or by any other association or body of persons or by an individual other than the candidate or his election agent shall not be deemed to be and shall not ever be deemed to have been expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorised by the candidate or by his election agent The proviso stated that nothing contained in the Explanation shall effect a any Judgment order or decision of <ORG> whereby the election of a candidate to <ORG> or to <ORG> State has been declared void or set aside before the commencement of the Representation of the People Amendment Ordinance any Judgment order or decision of <ORG> whereby the election of any such candidate has been declared void or set aside before the commencement of the said Ordinance if no appeal has been preferred to <ORG> against such judgment order or decision of the High court before such commencement and the period of limitation for filing such appeal has expired before such commencement Explanation which was added to Section of the act by the Amendment Act is as follows For the purposes of Explanation political party shall have the same meaning as in the Election Symbols Reservation and Allotment order as for the time being in force There are no findings by <ORG> in the present appeals that any expenses by a political party were authorised by the appellant There is also no finding in the present appeals that any expenses incurred by a political party can be identified with the election of the appellant There was no allegation to that effect in the petition This Court found that assuming the expenditure was incurred by the Maharaja and the Rajmata of Gwalior for the purpose of canvassing votes in the absence of any evidence to show that the Maharaja and the Rajmata acted as election agents or that the expenditure was authorised by the respondent it was not liable to be included in the election expenses On the behalf of the respondent it was said relying on the decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra that if the candidate takes advantage of expenditure incurred by the political party in connection with the election of the candidate or participates in the programme of activity or fails to disavow the expenditure the candidate cannot escape the rigour of the ceiling by saying that he has not incurred the expenditure but his political party has done so Expenditure incurred by a political party in connection with the election of the candidates of the party is not a part of the election expenses of the candidate A candidate is not required to disavow or denounce the expenditure incurred or authorised by the political party because the expenditure is neither incurred nor authorised by the candidate In <NAME> case there is an observation that expenses incurred by a political party to advance to the prospects of the candidates put up by it without more do not fall within Section of the Act The words something more were constructed by Counsel for the respondent to mean that if a candidate takes advantage of the expenditure incurred or authorised Third any provision in the legislative measures which has the effect of bringing about unfairness between different rival candidates in the matter of election is discriminatory and it not only contravene Article but also violates the implied limitation on legislative power relating to Section a of the Amendment Act which adds a proviso to Section of the Act to the effect that no symbol allotted under this Act to a candidate shall be deemed to be a religious symbol or a national symbol for the purposes of this clause is attacked as legalising religious symbols and thus offending secularism Section of the Amendment Act which enacts that the amendments shall have retrospective effect is challenged as retrospectively legalising a void election State of A The power of the <ORG> to pass a law includes a power to pass it retrospectively One of the views expressed in that case is that Article recognises the power of <ORG> to declare by law that the holder of the office shall not be disqualified for being chosen as a member Power is reserved to <ORG> to make the declaration There is nothing in the Article to indicate that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect It has been held in England that a candidate may be unseated for bribery of treating committed months or even years before the vacancy or election <NAME> <NAME> Sections A to I of the Indian Penal Code and the provisions contained in Sections to of the Act follow the pattern of English Act namely Statutes Victoria Chapter CII Statutes Victoria Chapter LXXXVII and Statutes Victoria Chapter LI In these sections dealing with the acts of persons other than candidates and voters no time is mentioned The word incur means to undertake the liability even if the actual payments may not be made immediately The contention on behalf of the respondent is that the Amendment Act of and fall within the vice of delegated legislation because there are no guiding principles with regard to official duty or nature of expenditure in Explanation to Section of the Act and in the proviso to Section of the Act Where a power is conferred or a duty imposed by statute or otherwise and there is nothing said expressly inhibiting the exercise of the power or the performance of the duty by any limitations or restrictions it is reasonable to hold that it carries with it the power of doing all such acts or employing such means as are reasonably necessary for such execution because it is a rule that when the law commands a thing to be done it authorises the performance of whatever may be necessary for executing its command There is no vice of delegation in the statutes This Court unanimously upheld the validity of the Twenty ninth Amendment Act Six Judges took the view that the Twenty ninth Amendment Act is valid and further that Article has been held by this Court to be independent of Article A and that Article protects scheduled Acts and Regulations and none of the scheduled Acts and Regulations is deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground of contravention of any fundamental rights Rule of the Rules aforesaid states that at an election in a parliamentary or assembly constituency where a poll becomes necessary the returning officer shall consider the choice of symbols expressed by the contesting candidates in their nomination papers and shall subject to any general or special direction issued in this behalf by <ORG> allot a different symbol to each contesting candidate in conformi With regard to the symbol of cow and calf being a religious symbol it was said on behalf of the respondent that <ORG> asked for cow calf and milkmaid symbol and were refused <ORG> on the evidence adduced by the respondent rightly came to the conclusion that there was no evidence to prove that the cow and calf is a religious symbol The date on the which <NAME> submitted his resignation and the same became effective is how The appellant held herself out as a prospective candidate from the Rae Bareli constituency immediately after the dissolution of <ORG> on December and for furtherance of her election prospects she obtained and procured the assistance of <NAME> who was at that time holding the post of Officer on Special Duty The appellant thus committed corrupt practice under Section of the Act The appellant thereby committed corrupt practice under Section of the Act The appellant and her election agent obtained the assistance of a number of gazetted officers and members of the police force for the furtherance of her election prospects inasmuch as the services of the District Magistrate Superintendent of Police <NAME> and the Home Secretary Uttar Pradesh Government were utilised for the purposes of the construction of rostrums and installation of loudspeakers at various places within the constituency where the appellant addressed her election meetings as also for the purpose of making arrangement of barricading and posting of police personnel on the routes by which the appellant was to travel in her constituency and at the places where she was to address meetings in order to give publicity to her visits and thus attract large crowds <NAME> election agent of the appellant and her other agents with the consent of <NAME> freely distributed quilts blankets dhotis and liquor among the voters to induce them to vote for her and thereby the appellant committed corrupt practice of bribery under Section of the Act During the period he was a gazetted officer in <ORG> he did not do any work in furtherance of the appellant election prospects Notwithstanding any judgment order or decision of any court to the contrary any expenditure incurred or authorised in connection with the election of a candidate by a political party or by any other association or body of persons or by any individual other than the candidate or his election agent shall not be deemed to be and shall not ever be deemed to have been expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorised by the candidate or by his election agent for the purposes of this sub section Provided Explanation The respondent filed writ petition challenging the validity of the amending Act On issue No the finding of <ORG> was that the total amount of expenditure incurred or authorised by the appellant or her election together with the expenditure proved to have been incurred by the party or by <ORG> in connection with the appellant election amounted to Rs As the respondent was found to have failed to prove that the expenses of the appellant or her election agent together with the expenses found to have been incurred by the political party and <ORG> in connection with the appellant election exceeded the prescribed limit <ORG> held that no ground had been made out for in The appellant was further found guilty of having committed another corrupt practice under Section of the Act by having obtained the assistance of <NAME> a gazetted officer in <ORG> holding the post of officer on the Special Duty in Prime Minister Secretariats for the furtherance of her election prospects An appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition is pending before <ORG> Section of the Amending Act substituted a new section for Section A in the Act According to the new section the case of every person found guilty of a corrupt practice by an order under Section shall be submitted as soon as may be after such order takes effect to the President for determination of the question as to whether such person shall be disqualified and if so for what period not exceeding six years The President shall then give his decision on such petition after obtaining the opinion In Section of the principal Act a in clause the following proviso shall be inserted at the end namely Provided that no symbol allotted under this Act to a candidate shall be deemed to be a religious symbol or a national symbol for the purposes of this clause in clause the following proviso shall be inserted at the end namely Provided that where any person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of the classes aforesaid in the discharge or purported discharge of his official duty makes any arrangements or provides any facilities or does any other act or thing for to or in relation to any candidate or his agent or any other person acting with the consent of the candidate or his election agent whether by reason of the office held by the candidate or for any other reason such arrangements facilities or act or thing shall not be deemed to be assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election in the Explanation at the end the following shall be added namely For the purposes of clauses notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the publication in <ORG> of the appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service of a person in the service of <ORG> including a person serving in connection with the administration of a Union territory or a state Government shall be conclusive proof i of such appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service as the case may be and ii whether the date of taking effect of such appointment resignation termination of service as the case may be is stated in such publication also of the case may be is stated in such publication also of the fact that such person was appointed with effect from the said date or in the case of resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service such person ceased to be in such service with effect from the said date The amendments made by Sections and of this Act in the principal Act shall also have retrospective operation so as to apply to and in relation to any election held before the commencement of this Act to either <ORG> of parliament or to either <ORG> or the <ORG> of the Legislature of a State i in respect of which any election petition may be presented after the commencement of this Act or ii in respect of which any election petition is pending in any High Court immediately before such commencement or iii in respect of which any election petition has been decided by <ORG> before such commencement but no appeal has been preferred to <ORG> against the decision of <ORG> before such commencement and the period of limitation for filing such appeal has not expired before such commencement or iv in respect of which appeal from any order of <ORG> made in any election petition under Section or section of the principal Act is pending before <ORG> immediately before such commencement It is submitted by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondent that the amendments made in the Act have an impact upon five out of the seven grounds which were set up by the respondent to assail the election of the appellant Subject to the provisions of Chapter II of Part Except sub clause of clause of Article no election a to either House of Parliament of a person who holds the office of Prime Minister at the time of such election or is appointed as Prime minister after such election to <ORG> of a person who holds the office of speaker of that <ORG> at the time of such election or who is chosen as the Speaker for that <ORG> after such election shall be called in question except before such authority not being any such authority as is referred to in clause of Article or body and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by parliament and any such law may provide for all other matters relating to doubts and disputes in relation to such election include the grounds on which such election may be questioned The validity of any such law as is referred to in clause and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court Where any person is appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> while an election petition referred to in clause of Article in respect of his election to either House of <ORG> or as the case may be to <ORG> is pending such election petition shall abate upon such person being appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be being chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> but such election may be called in question under any such law as is referred to in clause No law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in clause to either House of <ORG> and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void or has before such commencement been declared to be void under any such commencement been declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by any court before such commencement declaring such election to be void such election shall continue to be valid in all respects and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of no effect Any appeal or cross appeal against any such order of any court as is referred to in clause pending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act before <ORG> shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of clause The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution At the hearing of the appeal Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant has relied upon clause of the new Article A and has contended that that clause clearly applies to the present case It is urged that in view of that clause no law made by <ORG> before the coming into force of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act i before August in so far as it relates to the election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election to <ORG> of the appellant who being Prime Minister is one of the persons referred to in clause of that article The validity of the above constitutional amendment has been challenged by Mr <NAME> on the following two grounds The above constitutional amendment affects the basic structure or framework of the Constitution and is therefore beyond the amending power under Article It is made clear that the authority before which such election shall be called in question would not be the one as is referred to in clause of Article The law to be made by <ORG> under clause may provide for all other matters relating to doubts and disputes in relation to such election including the grounds on which such election may be questioned The fact that those measures were passed by the requisite majority has not been questioned by the learned Counsel but he submits that if the above mentioned members had not been detained and not been prevented from attending the sitting of <ORG> they could have influenced the other members and as such it is possible that the impugned Constitution Amendment Act and the Amending Act might not have been passed There is in my opinion no force in the above submission The proposition that a member of <ORG> cannot claim immunity from being detained under a law relating to preventive detention does not now admit of much doubt They challenged the validity of the orders of detention inter alia on the ground that Rule was invalid because a legislator cannot be detained so as to prevent him from exercising his constitutional rights as legislator while the legislative chamber to which he belongs is in session This Court rejected that contention and held that the true constitutional position is that so far as a valid order of detention is concerned a member of <ORG> can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and that he is as much liable to be arrested as detained under it as any other citizen Question as to whether a member of <ORG> has been validly detained under a law relating to preventive detention can in my opinion be appropriately gone into in proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus In deciding a case before it the court should decide matters which arise directly in the case No law contemplated by clause has been made by the <ORG> in India and as such we have to find out the powers privileges and immunities of the <ORG> of Commons in United Kingdom at the relevant time In the case of <NAME> <NAME> the plaintiff having been returned as member for the borough of Northampton required the speaker of the <ORG> of Commons to call him to the table for the purpose of taking oath It may be pertinent in this context to refer to the position in the United States where it was laid down in the case of <ORG> <NAME> as under The signing by the Speaker of <ORG> and by the President of the <ORG> in open session of an enrolled bill is an official attestation by the two houses that such bill has passed by <ORG> and when the bill thus attested receives the approval of the President and is deposited in the public archives its authentication as a bill that has passed <ORG> is complete and unimpeachable In the case of a constitutional amendment which requires ratification by the States the position was stated by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> as follows The proclamation by the Secretary certified that from official documents on file in <ORG> it appeared that the proposed Amendment was ratified by <ORG> six States and that it has become valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution of the United States As the Legislatures of Tennessee and West Virginia had power to adopt the resolutions of ratification official notice to the Secretary duly authenticated that they had done so was conclusive upon him and being certified to by his proclamation is conclusive upon the courts I am therefore of the view that the constitutional validity of the Constitution Amendment Act and the Act amendment the Representation of the People Act cannot be assailed on the ground that some members of <ORG> were prevented because of their detention from attending and participating in the proceedings of the respective Houses of <ORG> I therefore express no opinion about the validity of the other clauses of Article A Clause consists of four parts i No law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to the election petitions of matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in clause to either House of <ORG> ii and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void or has before such commencement been declared to be void under any such law iii and notwithstanding any order made by any court before such commencement declaring such election to be void such election shall continue to be valid in all respects iv and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of no effect In so far as part i is concerned I find that it relates to a matter which can be the subject of an ordinary legislation or a constitutional amendment According to this part no law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to the election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply and shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in clause to either House of <ORG> The power of a <ORG> to make a law with retrospective effect is not curtailed or circumscribed by the fact that th If the previous law in so far as it relates to the election petitions and matters connected therewith was not to apply to the election of the Prime Minister and the Speaker it would necessarily follow that the election of the appellant who was the Prime Minister would not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground on which such election could be declared to be void or has before such commencement been declared to be void under any such law If the previous law in so far as it relates to the election petitions and matters connected therewith was not to apply to the election of the appellant <ORG> shall be deemed to have had no jurisdiction to decide the election petition challenging the election of the appellant The effect of part i of clause is that <ORG> was divested of the jurisdiction to decide the dispute relating to the election of the appellant with a retrospective effect A declaration that an order made by a court of law is void is normally part of the judicial function and is not a legislative function The <ORG> is not only prohibited from reopening cases previously decided by the courts but is also forbidden to affect the inherent attributes of a judgment It is worthy of notice however that there are cases in which judgments requiring acts to be done in the future may validly be affected by subsequent legislation making illegal that which the judgment found to be legal or making legal that which the judgment found to be illegal Although normally a declaration that the judgment of a court is void can be made either in separate proceedings or in proceedings before the higher court there is according to this view no bar to the constituent authority making a declaration in the constitutional law that such an order would be void especially when it relates to a matter of public importance like the dispute relating to the election of a person holding the office of Prime Minister According to Article without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained There was speculation during the argument as to what the position would be if <ORG> sought to procure such a result by first amending the Constitution by a two thirds majority It was open to the constituent authority to fill that vacuum by prescribing a law which was to govern the dispute arising out of the petition filed by the respondent to challenge the election of the appellant There is nothing in clause to indicate that the constituent authority applied any law in declaring the election of the appellant to be valid and if so what was that law The difficulty in accepting this argument is that in part i of clause the constituent authority expressly stated that the previous law namely the Act as amended in so far as it related to election petitions and matters connected therewith was not to apply so far as the challenge to the election of the appellant was concerned It is also difficult to agree that the constituent authority took into account some other unspecified law or norm in declaring the election of the appellant to be valid As mentioned earlier there is nothing in clause to indicate that the constituent authority took into account some other law or norm and if so what that law or norms was It is further plain that if the validity of the election of a candidate is challenged on some grounds the said election can be declared to be valid only if we provide a forum for going into those grounds and prescribe a law for adjudicating upon those grounds The further vice from which the said clause suffers is that it not merely divests the previous authority namely <ORG> of its jurisdiction to decide the dispute relating to the election of the appellant it confers no jurisdiction on some other authority to decide that dispute To confer an absolute validity upon the election of one particular candidate and to prescribe that the validity of that election shall not be questioned before any forum or under any law would necessarily have the effect of saying that howsoever gross may be the improprieties which might have vitiated that election howsoever flagrant may be the malpractices which might have been committed on behalf of the returned candidate during the course of the election and howsoever foul and violative of the principles of free and fair elections may be the means which might have been employed for securing success in that election the said election would be nonetheless valid and it would not be permissible to complain of those improprieties malpractices and unfair means before any forum or under any law with a view to assail the validity of that election It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the grounds on account of which the election of the appellant has been held to be void by <ORG> were of a technical nature I cannot accede to the submission that in construing clause we should take into account the facts of the appellant case Another argument advanced in support of the validity of the amendment is that we should take it that the constituent authority constituted itself to be the forum for deciding the dispute relating to the validity of the election of the appellant and after considering the facts of the case declared the election of the appellant to be valid There is however nothing before us as to indicate that the constituent authority went into the material which had been adduced before <ORG> relating to the validity of the election of the appellant and after considering that material held the election of the appellant to be valid Indeed the statement of objects and reasons appended to the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Bill makes no mention of this thing In any case the vice of clause would still lie in the fact that the election of the appellant was declared to be valid on the basis that it was not to be governed by any law for settlement of election disputes There are many countries like France Japan and the United States of America where consistently with the democratic set up the determination of such controversies is by <ORG> or by authorities other than the courts that there is ample provision for the determination of such disputes after the poll As it is what we find is that so far as the dispute relating to the election of the appellant is concerned neither the previous law governing the election of persons holding the office of the Prime Minister is to apply to it nor the future law to be framed under clause of Article A governing the election of persons holding the office of Prime Minister is to apply to this dispute The argument has a seeming plausibility about it but a deeper reflection would show that it is vitiated by a basic fallacy It may apply to all the persons or class of persons or even individuals of a particular description According to <NAME> law as distinguished from laws is the system of authoritative materials for grounding or guiding judicial and administrative action recognized or established in a politically organized society be decided is that if the impugned amendment of the Constitution violates a principle which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution can it enjoy immunity from an attack on its validity because of the fact that for the future the basic structure of the Constitution remains unaffected If so it would be an impermissible amendment and it would make no difference whether it relates to one case or a large number of cases As a result of the above I strike down clause of Article A on the ground that it violates the principle of free and fair elections which is an essential postulate of democracy and which in its turn is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution inasmuch as it abolishes the forum without providing for another forum for going into the dispute relating to the validity of the election of the appellant and further prescribes that the said dispute shall not be governed by any election law and the validity of the said election shall be absolute and not consequently be liable to be assailed and it extinguishes both the right and the remedy to challenge the validity of the aforesaid election So far as this appeal is concerned it has been argued by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant that the grounds on which the election of the appellant has been declared by <ORG> to be void no longer hold good in view of the amendment in the Act by Act of One of the question which actually arose for determination before <ORG> was as to what was the date on which the appellant held herself out as a candidate According to the written statement filed on behalf of the appellant she held herself out as a candidate from the Rae Bareli constituency on February when she filed her nomination paper The question as to when a person holds himself out as candidate therefore loses its importance in the context of the new definition According to clause of Section of the Act the following act shall constitute corrupt practice under that clause The obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent any assistance other than the giving of vote for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election from any person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of the following classes namely a gazetted officers stipendiary judges and magistrates members of the armed forces of the union members of the police forces excise officers revenue officer other than village revenue officers known as Lambardars Malguzars Deshmukhs or by any other name whose duty is to collect land revenue and who are remunerated by a share of or commission on the amount of land revenue collected by them but who do not discharge any police function and such other class of persons in the service of the Government as may be prescribed In this section the expression agent includes an election agent polling agent and any person who is held to have acted as an agent in connection with the consent of the candidate Perusal of the above clause shows that what constitutes corrupt practice under the above clause is the obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure by a candidate or his agent or by any person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent any assistance other than giving of vote for the furtherance of the prospects of the candidate election from any person in the person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of the classes specified therein Mr <NAME> has invited our attention to clause of Section of the Act wherein it is stated that subject to the provisions of sub section of the section if <ORG> is of the opinion that any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by any other person with the consent of a returned candidate or his election agent <ORG> shall declare the election of the returned candidate to be void These observations have been made in the context of the statutory provisions in the United Kingdom This is indeed clear from letter dated November from <ORG> <ORG> to all State Governments wherein there is reference to rule of the Rules and Instructions for the Protection of the Prime Minister and it is state As the security of the Prime Minister is the concern of the <ORG> all arrangements for putting up the rostrums the barricades etc Assuming that the finding of fact recorded by <ORG> in this respect is correct the appellant can still be not guilty of the commission of corrupt practice under Section of the Act in view of the new proviso which has been inserted at the end of clause of the Section and which reads as under Provided that where any person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of classes aforesaid in the discharge or purported discharge of his official duty makes any arrangements or provides any facilities or does any other act or thing for to or in relation to any candidate or his agent or any other person acting with the consent of the candidate or his election agent whether by reason of the office held by the candidate or for any other reason such arrangements facilities or act or thing shall not be deemed to be assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election The above proviso has also a direct bearing on the allegation of the respondent that the appellant committed corrupt practice under Section of the Act inasmuch as she or her election agent procured the assistance of members of armed forces of the <ORG> for furtherance of her election prospects because of the fact that the members of the armed forces arranged planes and helicopters of <ORG> for her flights to enable her to address meetings in her constituency It has been argued by Mr <NAME> that the words in the discharge or purported discharge of his official duty in the above mentioned proviso have reference only to statutory duty and not to other duty performance of which takes place in pursuance of administrative instructions I find it difficult to accede to the above submission as there is nothing in the above proviso to confine the words official duty to duty imposed by statute We may also before dealing with the validity of Act of refer to one other change brought about by that Act which has a bearing upon the present case In assailing the validity of Act of Mr <NAME> has referred to Section of that Act according to which the amendments made by Sections and of the Act in the Act shall have retrospective operation so as to apply to any election held before the commencement of the Act in respect of which an election petition is pending or in respect of which appeal from any order of <ORG> is pending immediately before the commencement of Act of I have given the matter my earnest consideration and am of the opinion that there is no substance in the above contention A <ORG> has except in a matter for which there is prohibition like the one contained in Article of the Constitution the power to make laws which are prospective in operation as well as laws which have retrospective operation There is no limitation on the power of the <ORG> in this respect The respondent who was defeated at the elections filed a writ petition before the High court challenging the elections The State took the view that the judgment affected not merely the Cuttack Municipality but other municipalities also Accordingly the Governor promulgated an Ordinance validating the elections to the Cuttack Municipality and validating the electoral rolls prepared in respect of various munici The Cuttack municipal elections had been set aside by <ORG> and if the governor thought that in the public interest having regard to the factors enumerated in the preamble to the Ordinance it was necessarily follow that the Ordinance suffers from the vice of contravening Article It was further observed Therefore if the infirmity in the electoral rolls on which the decision of the High court in the earlier writ petition was based had not been applicable to the electoral rolls in regard to other municipalities in the State of Orissa then it may have been open to the Governor to issue an ordinance only in respect of the Cuttack municipal elections and if on account of special circumstances or reasons applicable to the Cuttack municipal elections a law was passed in respect of the said elections alone it could not have been challenged as unconstitutional under Article The appellant then came up in appeal to this Court All the five Judges constituting <ORG> were however unanimous on the point that the Act of had removed the disqualification of the appellant retrospectively The article says that a person shall be disqualified if he holds an office of profit under <ORG> or <ORG> unless that office is declared by the legislature not to disqualify the holder There is nothing in the words of the article to indicate that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect It seems to us that there is no force in this contention It has been held in numerous cases by this Court that the State Legislatures and <ORG> can legislate retrospectively subject to the provisions of the Constitution We notice that the British <ORG> in one case validate the election Erskine May Treatise on the Law Privileges Proceedings Usage of <ORG> Seventeenth Edition After the general election of it was found that the persons elected for the Coatbridge Division of Lanark and the Springbourn Division of Glassgow were disqualified at the time of their election because they were members of tribunals appointed by the Minister under the Rent of Furnished Houses Control Scotland Act which entitled them to a small fee in respect of attendance at a tribunal We have also noticed two earlier instances of retrospective legislation the House of Commons Disqualification Act Halsburry Statutes of England and Section of the Re election of Ministers Act ibid Great stress was laid on the word declare in Article a but we are unable to imply any limitation on the powers of the <ORG> from this world In any case the proposition of law laid down in the case of <NAME> supra is binding upon us and I do not find any reason to detract either from the soundness of the view expressed therein or its binding effect <ORG> also upheld in the case of <NAME> <NAME> an Order in Council giving retrospective effect to an election law in Ceylon An order in <ORG> made provision as to <ORG> in Ceylon but reserved to His Majesty power to revoke alter or amend the Order The appellant as common informer brought an action to recover penalties under the Order from the respondent who he alleged had sat and voted after his seat had become vacant under its provisions by reason of his having pecuniary interest in a contract with the Government There is no necessity to give instances to prove that they have frequently done so even going so far as to restore the heritable quality to blood which had been deprived of its virtue by acts of attainder The said provisions of Act of are general in terms and would apply to all election disputes which may be pending either in <ORG> or in appeal before <ORG> or which may arise in future This Court held that the above provision was also applicable to appeals which were pending at the commencement of that Act as an ap It is true that it gave an advantage to those who stand when the disqualification was not so removed as against those who may have kept themselves back because the disability was not removed That might raise questions of the propriety of such retrospective legislation but not of the capacity to make such laws Likewise <NAME> expressly rejected the contention that retrospective amendment in election law was bad because it was not a healthy practice and because such a course was liable to be abused in the following words The apprehension that it may not be a healthy practice and this power might be abused in a particular case are again no grounds for limiting the powers of <ORG> The proper course in such an event would be to strike down the action taken under the amended law and not the law itself Nor is it necessary to express opinion on the point as to whether it is permissible to make a law which has the effect of creating a corrupt practice or disqualification retrospectively and thus unseating a returned candidate as such a question does not arise in this case The fact that as a result of the above change we have to take into account only the prejudicial activity of the candidate or his election agent from the date of nomination of the candidate and not from the date he holds himself out as a candidate does not affect the process of free and fair elections In taking action under the above provision it must be borne in mind as stated on page of Free Elections by <NAME> that in the last resort In spite of some difficulty which may arise in borderline cases this distinction must be borne in mind If however because of doing something conceived in public interest as in the present case the security arrangement for the person holding the office of the Prime Minister some advantage may also possibly accrue to a candidate it will have to be regarded as incidental and would not detract from action taken under the above provision being in public interest As against that any action taken with a view to further the personal interest of a candidate should not be allowed to be camouflaged as an action taken in public interest Argument has also been advanced that validity of Act of cannot be assailed on the ground that it strikes at the basis structure of the Constitution iii Payments made to the drivers of vehicles specified in para Payments made to the workers engaged for the purpose of election propaganda In appeal before us Mr <NAME> has assailed the finding of <ORG> in so far as <ORG> has not accepted the case of the respondent that the appellant incurred expenses on the cost of hiring petrol petrol and the salary of the drivers for vehicles Section of the Act provides inter alia that if it appears to <ORG> that in connection with an election held within the State any vehicle is needed or is likely to be needed for the purpose of transport of ballot boxes to or from any polling station or transport of members of the police force for maintaining order during the conduct of such election or transport of any officer or other person for performance of any duties in connection with such election the Government may be order in writing requisition such vehicle provided that no vehicle which is being lawfully used by a candidate or his agent for any purpose connected with the election of such candidate shall be requisitioned until the completion of the poll at such election <ORG> in not accepting the case of the respondent in respect of the vehicles observed that there was nothing to show that the above mentioned vehicles had been obtained on hire or were obtained gratis There is no cogent evidence to show that the vehicles in question were used for the election of the appellant iii Equal attention was paid to all the three costituecies and there was proportionate use of the vehicles for the three constituencies If so it was in my opinion essential for the respondent to lead some evidence regarding the use of the vehicles There was also as mentioned earlier no other cogent evidence to show that those vehicles or any them were used for the appellant election in the Rae Bareli constituency and if so to what extent The fact that <NAME> was not examined as a witness on behalf of the appellant would not warrant the filling in of the gaps and lacunae in the evidence adduced by the respondent by a process akin to guess work Question arose as to whether the expense incurred in connection with that jeep could be included in the election expenses of the returned candidate Reference has also been made during the course of arguments by Mr <NAME> to some entries in a register of <ORG> Our attention has been invited by Mr <NAME> to a report in issue dated January of <ORG> wherein there was a reference to the Personal Secretary of the Prime Minister having reached Rae Bareli with a caravan of motor vehicles The other difficulty which I find in accepting the submission of Mr <NAME> in respect of vehicles is that there is no evidence to show that any payment was made for the use of the above mentioned vehicles There is also nothing to show that those vehicles were engaged on hire Mr <NAME> has next assailed the finding of <ORG> in so far as it has held that the respondent has failed to prove that the appellant incurred an expense of Rs I however find no infirmity in the finding of <ORG> in this respect as there is no cogent evidence whatsoever that any expense was incurred for engaging workers for the election work of the appellant There was no reference to the said amount of Rs There is also no reference to the amount of Rs I find no cogent reason to interfere with that finding Nor is it necessary to express an opinion about the view taken in <NAME> <NAME> in view of the fact that even after applying the rule laid down in that case the total election expense of the appellant has not been shown to exceed the prescribed limit There was a controversy during the course of arguments on the point as to whether I have laid down in my judgment in <NAME> case supra that fundamental rights are not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution I also did not agree with the view taken in the case of <NAME> that the I am further of the opinion that amendment of the Constitution necessarily contemplates that the Constitution has not to be abrogated but only changes have to be made in it The word amendment postulates that the old Constitution survives without loss of identity despite the change and continues even though it has been subjected to alterations No serious objection is taken to repeal addition or alteration of provisions of the Constitution other than those in Part III under the power of amendment conferred by Article It would be impermissible to differentiate between scope and width of power of amendment when it deals with fundamental rights and the scope and width of that power when it deals with provisions not concerned with fundamental rights It would appear from the above that no distinction was made by me so far as the ambit and scope of the power of amendment is concerned between a provision relating to fundamental rights and provisions dealing with matters other than fundamental rights This was further made clear by the following observations on page <ORG> para Subject to the retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution I have no doubt that the power of amendment is plenary and would include within itself the power to add alter or repeal the various articles including those relating to fundamental rights Proposition vii of the summary of my conclusions on page of the judgment also bears it out and the same reads as under SCC para vii The power of amendment under Article does not include power to abrogate the Constitution nor does it include the power to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution Subject to the retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution the power of amendment is plenary and includes within itself the power to amend the various articles of the Constitution including those relating to fundamental rights as well as those which may be said to relate to essential features The power of amendment would also include within itself the power to add alter or repeal the various articles I also dealt with the matter at length to show that the right to property was not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution These immediate interests exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure <ORG> It therefore became essential to rid the case of all the embellishments resulting from the political overtones and to bring it to a level which is strictly judicial so that the various constitutional and legal aspects of the matter may be examined That all constitutional interpretations have political consequences should not obliterate the fact that the decision has to be arrived at in the calm and dispassionate atmosphere of the court room that judges in order to give legitimacy to their decision have to keep aloof from the din and controversy of politics and that the fluctuating fortunes of rival political parties can have for them only academic interest Looking to all the circumstances more particularly the fact that the election petition filed by the respondent is being dismissed because of changes made in law during the pendency of the appeal the parties are directed to bear their own costs throughout During the pendency of these appeals the <ORG> passed the Election Laws Amendment Act on August by which certain amendments were made in the provisions of the Representation of the People Act and the Indian Penal Code By clause of the article it was provided that all doubts or Vice President shall be inquired into and decided by such authority or body in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law referred to in clause Clause stated that the validity of any such law referred to in clause and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court The validity of any such law as is referred to in clause and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court Where any person is appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> while an election petition referred to in clause of Article in respect of his election petition referred to in clause of Article in respect of his election to either House of Parliament or as the case may be to <ORG> is pending such election petition shall abate upon such person being appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be being chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> but such election may be called in question under any such law as is referred to in clause No law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in clause to either House of <ORG> and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become or has before such commencement been declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by any court before such commencement declaring such election to be void such election shall continue to be valid in all respects and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of not effect Any appeal or cross appeal against any such order of any court as is referred to in clause pending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act before <ORG> shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of clause The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution The argument was that although the amending body could declare that the election of the appellant shall not be deemed to be void and the judgment of <ORG> to be void on the basis that no law relating to election petition and matters connected therewith would apply to the election yet the amending body could not have held the election to be valid as it did not ascertain the facts relating to the election and apply the relevant law to them On the other hand it might be possible to view the first part of clause as an exercise of judicial power for the reason that even assuming that by virtue of the retrospective repeal of the law relating to election petition there was no jurisdiction in <ORG> to entertain or try the election petition and pass the judgment a repeal simpliciter did not render the judgment ipso facto void and therefore in making the declaration that the judgment was void the amending body was And before an election machinery can be brought into operation there are three requisites which require to be attended to namely there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made there should be an executive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections and there should be a judicial tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections And when a dispute is raised as regards the validity of the election of a particular candidate the authority entrusted with the task of resolving the dispute must necessarily exercise a judicial function for the process consists of ascertaining the facts relating to the election and applying the law to the facts so ascertained It was contended for the appellant that in England it was <ORG> which originally decided election disputes concerning its members that it was only in that the function was delegated to committees and therefore <ORG> is the proper forum for deciding election disputes of its was framed the decision of an election dispute had ceased to be a privilege of <ORG> in England and therefore under Article it could not be a privilege of <ORG> in this country Provisions is made in each case for constituting a rota from whom these judges are selected But it does not follow from the public character of the controversy that there is no lis between the parties to the election contest and that the lis can be resolved otherwise than by ascertaining the facts relating to the election and applying the relevant law A judicial inquiry investigates declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power <ORG> had occasion to consider this question in <ORG> <NAME> According to the historic analysis the essence of the distinction between legislative power and judicial power is that the <ORG> makes new law which becomes binding on all persons over whom the <ORG> exercises legislative power the <ORG> applies already existing law in the resolution of disputes between particular parties and judges may not deviate from this duty If it is made clear that sovereign is not a mortal God and can express himself or itself only in the manner and form prescribed by law and can be sovereign only when in the manner and form prescribed by law and can be sovereign only when he or it acts in a certain way also prescribed by law then perhaps the use of the expression will have no harmful consequence But there is not doubt that law does not consist of general norms only In his view there was not distinction between creation and application of law a view I find difficult to accept in the light of clear distinction made by the decisions of this <ORG> between legislative and judicial functions On March the Criminal Law Special Provisions Act was passed and it was given retrospective effect from January <ORG> said in the course of their judgment that the pith and substance of the law enactments was a legislative plan ex post facto to secure the conviction that although legislation ad hominem which is directed to the course of particular proceedings may not always amount to an interference with the functions of the <ORG> but in the present case they had no doubt that there was such interference that it was not only the likely but the intended effect of the impugned enactments and that it was fatal to their validity They further said that the true nature and purpose of these enactments were revealed by their conjoint impact on the specific proceedings in respect of which they were designed and they took their colour in particular from the alterations they purported to make as to their ultimate objective the punishment of those convicted and that these alterations constituted a grave and deliberate incursion into the judicial sphere and then they quoted with approval the observation At the time when the amendment was passed the appeal filed by the appellant and the cross appeal of the respondent were pending before <ORG> If the amending body really exercised judicial power that power was exercised in violation of the principles of natural justice of <ORG> Even if a power is given to a body without specifying that the rules of natural justice should be observed in exercising it the nature of the power would call for its observance The Solicitor General contended that the amending body in declaring that the election was valid was exercising its constituent legislative power that legislative power does not adjudicate but only creates validity even retrospectively by enacting a law with that effect that validation is law making that it alters the legal position by making new law and that validation may take place before or after a judgment He said that by the repeal of the provisions of the Representation of the People Act the amending body had wiped out not only the election petition but also the judgment of <ORG> and had deprived the respondent of the right to raise any dispute as regards the validity of the election of the appellant and therefore there was no dispute to be adjudicated upon by the amending body He also said I think in the alternative that although the law relating to election petitions and other matters connected therewith was dispensed with in respect of the appellant the amending It is difficult to understand when the amending body expressly excluded the operation of all laws relating to election petition and matters connected therewith by the first part of clause what ideal norms of free and fair election it had in view in adjudging the validity of the election of the appellant Quite apart from it there is nothing on the face of the amendment to show that the amending body ascertained the facts of the case or applied any norms for determining the validity of the election There is also nothing to show that the amending body validated the election with reference to any change of the law which formed the foundation of the judgment The cases cited by the Solicitor General to show that a competent <ORG> has power to validate an invalid election do not indicate that there can be a validation without changing the law which invalidated the election Nor do I think that a contested election can be validated without an authority applying the new law to the facts as ascertained by judicial process If the court which ascertained the facts and applied the law was rendered coram non judice the facts ascertained by it have ceased to be facts There are no absolute or immediately evident facts There is no fact in itself If clause was an exercise in legislative validation without changing the law which made the election invalid when there ought to have been an exercise of judicial power of ascertaining the adjudicative facts and applying the law the clause would damage the democratic structure of the Constitution as the Constitution visualizes the resolution of an election dispute by a petition presented to an authority exercising judicial power The contention that there was no election dispute as clause by repealing the law relating to election petition had rendered the petition filed by the respondent non est if allowed will toll the death knell of the democratic structure of the Constitution In <NAME> <NAME> the facts were An order in council of made provision as to <ORG> in Ceylon but reserved to His Majesty power to revoke alter or amend the order The appellant as common informer brought an action to recover penalties under the Order from the respondent who he alleged had sat and voted after his seat had become vacant under its provisions by reason of his having a pecuniary interest in a contract with the Government The direction to dismiss must be understood in the light of an earlier provision in the same Order in Council which amended the law on which the proceeding was founded the dismissal was thus the result of the change in the law and all that the later clause showed was that the change was to have retrospective effect and govern the rights of parties even in pending proceedings The decision in <NAME> King Emperor concerned the validation of a sentence imposed by a special criminal court which was held to have no jurisdiction to try the case by an order of a court It was held that there was no exercise of any judicial power by the legislating authority It was held that Act of had removed the disqualification retrospectively that <ORG> and <ORG> can legislate retrospectively subject to the provisions of the Constitution that no limitation on the powers of the <ORG> to make a declaration validating an election could be put and that by enacting the im The State took the view that the judgment affected not merely the Cuttack municipality but other municipalities also Accordingly the Governor promulgated an Ordinance validating the elections to the Cuttack municipality and validating the electoral rolls prepared in respect of other municipalities This Court held that Section of the Ordinance effectively removed the defects in the electoral rolls found by <ORG> by its judgment and that it successfully cured the invalidity of the electoral roll and of the elections to the Cuttack municipality The Solicitor General also cited other decisions to show that a <ORG> can validate proceedings rendered invalid by judgment of court Counsel for the appellant also brought to the notice of the <ORG> certain election validation Acts passed by <ORG> in England Nor can these instances of legislative removal of disqualification furnish any assistance to this <ORG> for the reason that in England there is no theory of basic structure operating as a fetter on the power of <ORG> It was argued for the respondent that if the amending body exercised judicial power and held the election of the appellant valid its act was unconstitutional also on the ground it damaged another basic structure of the Constitution namely the doctrine of separation of powers It may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely judgment There is no liberty he said if the judicial power to be separated from the legislative and executive But this doctrine which is directed against the concentration of these powers in the same hand has no application as such when the question is whether an amending body can exercise judicial power And if the amending body exercised judicial power in adjudging the validity of the election it cannot be said that by that act it has damaged a basic structure of the Constitution embodied in the doctrine of separation of powers Even so the question will remain whether it could exercise judicial power without passing a law enabling it to do so In other words even though a sovereign can act only by making law the law he so makes may vest the authority to exercise judicial power in himself without such law he cannot exercise judicial power The amending body though possessed of judicial power had not competence to exercise it unless it passed a constitutional law enabling it to do so The Solicitor General submitted that the majority in <NAME> case supra did not hold that Article pertains to the basic structure that apart from Article there is no principle of equality which is a basic structure of the Constitution and that it is not a chameleon like concept which changes its colour with the nature of the subject matter to which it is applied Democracy proceeds on two basic assumptions popular sovereignty in the sense that the country should be governed by the representatives of the people that all power came from them at their pleasure and under their watchful supervision it must be held and that there should be equality among the citizens in arriving at the decisions affecting them and there is no other principle of equality which is an essential feature of our democratic polity Nor did it have such a meaning for <NAME> If it is contrary to the rule of law that discretionary authority should be given to government departments or public officers then there is no rule of law in any modern State What previously announced rules guide them in laying down the new precedents A court of law decides a case of first impression no statute governs no precedent is applicable All these would show that it is impossible to enunciate the rule of law which has as its basis that no decision can be made unless there is a certain rule to govern the decision Leaving aside these extravagant versions of rule of law there is a genuine concept of rule of law and that concept implies equality before the law or equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law Even if I assume that rule of law is a basic structure it seems to me that the meaning and the constituent elements of the concept must be gathered from the enacting provisions of the Constitution Clause to of Article A are severable but I express no opinion on their validity as it is not necessary for deciding this case Counsel for the respondent submitted that if by a constitutional amendment the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be destroyed or damaged it would be illogical to assume that an ordinary law passed under a power conferred by that instrument can do so and since these Acts damage the concept of free and fair election the Acts were bad I think the inhibition to destroy or damage the basic structure by an amendment of the Constitution flows from the limitation on the power of amendment under Article read into it by the majority in <NAME> case supra because of their assumption that there are certain fundamental features in the Constitution which its makers intended to remain there in perpetuity But I do not find any such inhibition so far as the power of <ORG> or <ORG> to pass laws is concerned Article and give the power and also provide the limitation upon the power of these organs to pass laws The essential features of the great concepts set out in the preamble are delineated in the various provisions of the Con To <NAME> justice is an irrational ideal and regarded from the point of rational cognition he thinks there are only interests and hence conflict of interest They mean different things to different people The enacting provisions in the body of the Constitution alone give concrete shape to these ideas and it is on the basis of these provisions that the validity of or As I said like other laws made by <ORG> or <ORG> the laws made under Articles and are liable to be tested by Part III of the Constitution or any other provision of the Constitution but it is difficult to see how these laws could be challenged on the ground that they do not conform to some ideal notions of free and fai The courts are not at liberty to declare an Act void because in their opinion it is opposed to the spirit of democracy or republicanism supposed to pervade the Constitution but not expressed in words When the fundamental law has not limited either in terms or by necessary implication the general powers conferred upon the <ORG> we cannot declare a limitation under the notion of having discovered some ideal norm of free and fair election It is rather strange that an Act which is put in the Ninth Schedule with a view to obtain immunity from attack on the ground that the provisions thereof violate the fundamental rights should suddenly become vulnerable on the score that they damage or destroy a basic structure of the Constitution resulting not from the taking away or abridgment of the fundamental rights but for some other reason There is no support from the majority in <NAME> case supra for the proposition advanced by Counsel that an ordinary law if it damages or destroys basic structure should be held bad or for the proposition that a constitutional amendment putting an Act in the Ninth Schedule would make the provisions of the Act vulnerable for the reason that they damage or destroy a basic structure constituted not by the fundamental rights taken away or abridged but some other basic structure And in principle I see no reason for accepting the correctness of the proposition The utmost that can be said is as I indicated that even after putting them in the Ninth Schedule their provisions would be open to challenge on the ground that they took away or abrogated all or any of the fundamental rights and therefore damaged or destroyed a basic structure if the fundamental rights or right taken away or abrogated constitute or constitutes a basic structure Counsel for the respondent then contended that retrospective operation has been given to the provisions of these Acts and that that would destroy or damage an essential feature of democracy viz free and fair elections This is inevitable but that is no reason to deny to the <ORG> the power to enact retrospective law In the case of a law which has retrospective effect the theory is that the law was actually in operation in the past and if the provisions of the Acts are general in their operation there can be no challenge to them on the ground of discrimination or unfairness merely because of their retrospective effect In other words if an Act cannot be challenged on the ground that its provisions are discriminatory or unreasonable if it is prospective in operation those provisions cannot be attacked on these grounds merely because the provisions were given retrospective effect unless there are special circumstances The argument was that a number of members of the two Houses of <ORG> were illegally detained by executive orders before the summoning of the two Houses and that was made possible by the President the authority to summon the two Houses making an order under Article of the Constitution on June which precluded these members from moving the court and obtaining release from illegal detention and attending the session The question which fell for consideration in that case was whether when a member of <ORG> was convicted for a criminal offence and was undergoing a sentence in pursuance thereof he has an unconditional right to attend a Session of <ORG> This Court held that he had no privilege which obliged the court to release him from custody in order to enable him to attend the session In England a member of <ORG> who is convicted of a criminal offence and is undergoing sentence in pursuance to his conviction has no right or privilege to be released from custody for attending parliament The very same principle will apply in the case of a detention under an emergency regulation There is no foundation for it It has since been said that parliamentary roll is not conclusive that when the jurisdiction of a court is invoked it has power to determine whether everything necessary has been done for the production of a valid statute that rule of law requires that the court should determine legal questions raised before it and if its jurisdiction is properly invoked it has to answer the question whether the document is a statute duly enacted by a <ORG> there is a distinction between rules which govern on the one hand a the composition and the procedure and on the other hand the area of power of a Sovereign <ORG> the courts have jurisdiction to question the validity of an alleged Act of Parliament on grounds a and but not on ground It can only be sovereign when acting in a certain way prescribed by law If this is so it is open to the court to see whether a <ORG> has been properly summoned in order to decide the question whether a measure passed by it answers the description of a statute or an Act and that parliamentary roll if such a thing exists is not conclusive Article provides that the validity of any proceedings in <ORG> shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure So even if there is any irregularity in the procedure in the passing of the statute it is not open to a court to question its validity Article provides that the President shall from time to time summon <ORG> to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session If a statutory authority passes an illegal order of detention and thus prevents a member of <ORG> from attending the <ORG> how can the proceedings of <ORG> become illegal for that reason It is the privilege of <ORG> to secure the attendance of persons illegally detained If a situation arose which authorized the President to issue a proclamation under Article he could also suspend under Article the remedy to move the court to enforce the fundamental rights Clause of the Election Laws Amendment Act substituted the present definition in Section which reads candidate means a person who has been or claims to have been duly nominated as a candidate at an election He argued that if in Section the word returned candidate is used not with the idea of indicating that a person should have committed corrupt practice after he became a returned candidate there is no reason to think that the word candidate in Section has been used to show that the corrupt practice therein mentioned should have been committed after a person has become a candidate in order that the election of the candidate might be set aside But there is no such compulsion to read the word candidate in Section in the same manner It is the context that gives colour to a word When it is seen that a line or point there must be and there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely the decision of the <ORG> or its delegate must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of the reasonable mark I agree with his conclusion on the point The learned chief Justice has also dealt with the contention urged by Counsel for respondent that Section of the Election Laws amendment Act suffers from the vice of excessive delegation and is arbitrary I agree with his reasoning for repelling the same For the reasons given by <NAME> <NAME> in his judgment I hold that the finding of <ORG> on this issue was correct It was submitted by the learned Counsel for the original respondent in his opening address that Section of the Thirty ninth Amendment adding clause to Article A of the Constitution meant that <ORG> itself acting in its constituent capacity had taken the case in hand and had after applying its own standards decided it in favour of the original respondent so that the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to go into the merits of the case was ousted by clause read with clauses and sought to be added to Article A of the Constitution The constantly recurring and vehemently pressed theme of the arguments of the learned counsel for the election petitioner was that the context and the contents of the Acts of and and after that of Section of the Thirty ninth Amendment clearly indicated that the whole object of the Acts of and and of the constitutional amendment was an oblique one to deprive the election petitioner of the remedies he had under the law against an election vitiated by corrupt practices and of the benefits of a decision of <ORG> in his favour by taking away its grounds and then the jurisdiction of courts which existed at the time of the Thirty ninth Amendment to deal with the case so that this case may not in any event terminate in favour of the election petitioner In the circumstances indicated above it seemed to me to be absolutely essential for us to call upon the parties defending or assailing the Thirty ninth Amendment and the Acts of and to take us inter alia into the merits of the cases of the two sides and the findings given by the trying Judge so as to enable us to see how far these findings were justifiable under the law as it stood even before the amendments by the Acts of and how they were affected by these amendments and how they were related to the validity of Section of the Thirty ninth Amendment Speaking for myself I clearly indicated to learned Counsel for the parties that I regard the nature and merits of the case decided to be of crucial importance not only in considering the validity of the Thirty ninth amendment and of the Acts of and but also in the wider interests of justice which are bound to be served by the vindication of the case of the party which should on merits win Issues raised before us relating to the validity of the Thirty ninth amendment and the Acts of and were What are the constitutional purposes and ambit of the constituent power found in Article of our Constitution Were they in any way exceeded by the constituent authorities in making the Thirty ninth amendment in an unauthorised manner or for objects which however laudable were outside the scope of Article Was there any procedural irregularity in the composition of <ORG> which could enable this Court to hold that there was a basic defect in the enactment of either the Act or of the Thirty ninth amendment We do not when such a case comes up before us concern ourselves with the validity of provisions other than those which affect the case before us Therefore parties had to and did address us on the broad features of the findings given by the learned trial Judge and the nature of the evidence given to support them so that we may be able to decide inter alia whether any validation of the original respondent election which was the evident purpose of clause of Article A sought to be added by Section of the Thirty ninth amendment was at all necessary As to the legal effect of such a stay order there is no doubt in my mind that considering the clear words of Section A of the Act it deprived the order of <ORG> of any operative force whatsoever during th In a case where the bona fides of legislation and even of a constitutional amendment is questioned on the ground of a suggested frightfulness in the facts of the case which <ORG> and the ratifying State Legislatures are to be supposed if we are to accept the suggestion to have been acting in concert to prevent this Court from examining on merits it was I think the duty of Counsel making any such suggestion to invite our attention to any fact not fully disclosed or discussed in the judgment under appeal at least when he was asked as I repeatedly asked him in the course of his arguments extending over a period of about fifteen days out of a total period of hearing of the case for thirty two days how <ORG> conclusions on the two matters forming the subject matter of Appeal No of of the original respondent could possibly be justified As is not unusual the defeated candidate filed an election petition under the Act making all kinds of allegations including some quite extravagant ones which formed the subject matter of the first set of eleven issues framed on August Thereafter three additional issues were framed on April when the question whether an amendment of the petition sought after the period of limitation for filing a petition to challenge the election had expired should be permitted had been finally decided by this Court in favour of <NAME> He was of opinion that <NAME> a <ORG> servant and a gazetted officer of the rank of an Under Secretary deputed to serve in the Prime Minister Secretariat as an Officer on Special Duty had held his post until January when his resignation tendered on January was accepted by the President of India with effect from January by means of a notification published on February Section as it has stood unamended enumerates as the last of the classes of corrupt practice as follows Section the obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent any assistance other than the giving of vote for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election from any person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of the following classes namely a gazetted officers stipendiary judges and magistrates members of the armed forces of the Union members of the police forces excise officers Explanation In this section the expression agent includes an election agent a polling agent and any person who is held to have acted as an agent in connection with the election with the consent of the candidate The question of obtaining assistance through an agent or other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent could only arise where such a case of obtaining assistance indirectly through others is set up but not otherwise The law must lay down a duty to prevent by taking some steps which are not taken before a person is held liable for an omission And there is a difference between omission to prevent the doing of something and actual consent to the doing of it I do not find in the petition any case of a liability from omissions to do something set up obviously because the law does not impose upon the candidate the duty to prevent the giving of voluntary assistance by others whether officials or not It was a case of a direction given by the Prime Minister herself to Shri <NAME> who it had to be presumed for the purposes of such a case would not have given the aid if the direction or order was not there The definition given above in Section meant on an ordinary and natural interpretation of words used that the corrupt practice defined there could not be committed by any person before there was a candidate for an election Before however I deal with that question it is necessary to examine what obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting meant in the light of the law laid down repeatedly by this Court in cases of alleged corrupt practices Indeed any natural and ordinary interpretation on the words obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting must carry with it the imperative requirement that the candidate concerned or his agent must have intentionally done an act which has the effect contemplated by Section But Section requires actual intended acts of obtaining or procuring or attempting or abetting As regards both issues Nos and the learned Judge seemed to think that Section creates what is called an absolute statutory liability which does not require a mens rea although in dealing with issue No he had himself after citing the necessary authorities taken the view that a mens rea was also essential The learned Judge said Learned Counsel for the respondent then urged that even accepting that Shri <NAME> delivered a speech at Munshiganj on January and that he canvassed support for the respondent in that speech he was not an election agent on that date and there is no evidence of the fact that he had been instructed to do so by the respondent No Learned Counsel stressed that consequently it should not be held on that basis that the respondent No obtained or procured the assistance of Shri <NAME> for the furtherance of her election prospects I have given my careful consideration to this argument as well but I regret my inability to accept the same On January Shri <NAME> visited Rae Bareli and on the own admission of respondent No he did so with previous notice to the respondent No The ground for holding that <NAME> must be deposing falsely appears to me to be every unfair both to <NAME> and Shri <NAME> a <ORG>man who was suspected without the slightest foundation in evidence of having induced <NAME> to give perjured evidence simply because <NAME> who did not even appear as a witness was a member of the <ORG> party and was once connected with the school in which <NAME> served The learned Judge said It is quite likely that once <NAME> had conceded in cross examination that <NAME> had accompanied him to the Shaheed Mela pressure was brought to bear on <NAME> RW by <NAME> in order to make him appear as a witness in the case and give evidence to contradict the testimony of <NAME> Together with it there is also the fact that <NAME> another important worker of the respondent No happened to be the Adhyaksha of <ORG> during the period the witness was examined in the case It is a matter of common knowledge that the Adhyaksha of <ORG> during the period the witness was examined in the case Let us for the sake of argument assume that <NAME> had been overpowered by such a desire to exhibit an excessive zeal which got the better of his prudence that he believing that a publicly made gesture of his loyalty was needed on this particular occasion cast all caution to the winds and while paying the tribute he was called upon to pay to the memory of the martyrs suddenly decided to jump into the electoral fray by making an appeal at the martyrs mela to support Smt What is the position that emerges from a consideration of the circumstances found and detailed by the learned Judge himself It was held that <NAME> was occupying a position of trust and confidence with the original respondent for quite a long time In the passage from the judgment quoted above the learned Judge draws an inference of a previous instruction from the Prime Minister to <NAME> to say what he is alleged to have said in a speech because inter alia <NAME> met the Prime Minister on his return from Rae Bareli Again the necessary inference of a previous intimation by <NAME> to the Prime Minister of his intention to visit Rae Bareli could not be that there was any authority or direction given by the Prime Minister to <NAME> to do or to say anything on her behalf He also said that he had from time to time He had earlier said that this decision was taken with a view to do work for the public in general and the <ORG> party in particular as he wanted to enter public life It is unfortunate that the learned Judge thought that there was something almost sinister in <NAME> taking such interest in the election or in hoping to enter political life through absolutely legitimate means There is not the slightest reason for anyone who fairly examines the evidence of <NAME> supported by that of the Prime Minister and <NAME> to doubt the motives or the veracity of <NAME> on this point There was no plea anywhere and there is no express finding on it that the President notification itself which made the resignation effective from January was invalid to the extent that in purported to give any retrospective effect to the resignation in the sense that it made it effective from a date prior to its actual acceptance The fact that it is made effective from January shows that the letter must have reached the President Secretariat with the request that He also referred to an American case <ORG> United States to the effect that only the appointing could have accepted the resignation of an occupant of a public office and that under the special provisions of the law the holder of such an office could be subjected to a penalty for a wrongful refusal to perform the duties of his office In that case there was a dispute between the government servant and <ORG> on the question whether the government servant concerned could withdraw his resignation after it was accepted Hence there is no difficulty at all in accepting the correctness of a resignation effective from the date which both parties to the contract on patent facts had agreed by such an acceptance of the resignation from the date immediately after the date on which Shri <NAME> had tendered his resignation It is inconceivable that the law should thrust For the purposes of clause notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the publication in the Official Gazette of the appointment termination of service dismissal or removal from service of a person in the service of the Central <ORG> including a person serving in connection with the administration of a Union territory or of a State <ORG> shall be conclusive proof i of such appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service as the case may be and ii where the date of taking effect of such appointment resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service as the case may be is stated in such publication also of the fact that such person was appointed with effect from the said date or in the case of resignation termination of service dismissal or removal from service such person ceased to be in such service with effect from the said date If such powers are ever exercised in a mala fide manner it is the particular exercise of the power that can be questioned and struck down He is said to have either led or to have joined a procession of cars taken out on January in the town of Rae Bareli as a part of the election campaign for the original respondent although <NAME> PW an advocate who was a staunch worker produced on behalf of the election petitioner clearly stated that he had not seen <NAME> in that procession which he watched but he had seen him only on February <NAME> PW admittedly a highly partisan witness who was believed because of a question put to him in cross examination suggesting that there was uproar when <NAME> started speaking so that nobody could hear what he said There is no evidence whatsoever from any source that <NAME> did so on any of these three occasions either after having been requested by the original respondent to do so or with her knowledge or consent or approval There is no evidence whatsoever that <NAME> was constructed a sort of general de facto agent of the Prime Minister even before he became her election agent on January Therefore there is no finding on it by the learned Judge Of this there is not only no evidence whatsoever on record but the evidence is to The corrupt practices committed by the first three classes of persons are covered by Section while those committed by persons falling in the fourth class are provided against in Section ii The uncontroverted evidence is that after resigning <NAME> went to Rae Bareli voluntarily without any request or suggestion made to him by the original respondent or by anybody else to go to Rae Bareli and work for her election And with regard to the two earlier periods beginning with January I am unable to see for the reasons given above how any corrupt practice could be committed by the original respondent vicariously due to anything done by <NAME> even if one were to apply the law as it existed before the amendments of the Act In my opinion there is no basis for this assumption It has been repeatedly laid down in decided cases on the point that what is relevant is not what other people think or sa If such a question had been asked there is little doubt that she could have explained the statement by the context in which it was made just as she had given the precise meaning of her statement of December in the context in which it was made It seems to me that the learned Judge had given an exaggerated importance to what were either not strictly relevant or insignificant matters in preference to what could be and was decisive and unequivocal There is a gap between intent and action which has to be filled by proof of either statements or of conduct which amount to unequivocal declarations made to voters in the constituency in order to amount to a holding out to them It seems to me that the learned Judge was overlooking the context the probabilities the natural course of events in such a case the legal and logical relevance and effect of what he thought was decisive and finally the importance of the statement of the Prime Minister herself on this question supported by complete absence of any evidence to show that she had herself made any clear and decisive statement in any speech or conversation which could shake her stand that her final decision and unequivocal act was the filing of a In <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> relying upon the following observations of this Court in <NAME> case supra held that a holding out within the meaning of section must be by declaration of the candidate to an elector or to the electorate in a particular constituency and not to others It may be that the holding out which is contemplated by that section is to the constituency but if it is <ORG> that has to decide who shall be adopted for election from the concerned constituency any declaration made to the Committee is in effect addressed to the constituency through its accredited representative The view of the learned Judge appears to me to run counter to the weight of authorities cited above Learned Counsel for the election petitioner contended that this amendment read with Section of the Act of would retrospectively alter the rules of the game and would be destructive of the concept of free and fair elections if it means that a person is only a candidate after he has been duly nominated and that he can indulge in any amount of corrupt practices until the day previous to his nomination Corrupt practices of a candidate cannot go unpunished whether they are committed before or after he becomes a candidate when they amount to acts which come within the purview of electoral offences dealt with by Chapter Sections A or Chapter A of the Indian Penal Code It is as futile to complain of such a distinction made as it is to complain that a candidate possesses certain advantages at an election because of the personal services rendered to the country distinctions achieved by the candidate Again there are advantages which attach themselves to a candidate because of that candidate personal qualities qualification capacities or background The word has not been used in the sub section in the sense of a mere passive receipt of assistance without the candidate even being conscious of the fact that the assistance has been rendered In order to bring the case under sub section it must be shown that the candidate did make some efforts or perform some purposeful act in order to get the assistance If however there was any doubt or uncertainty on the matter the view taken by the learned Judge had at any rate directed the attention of <ORG> to the need for a clarification of the law which became necessary <ORG> could certainly set right a defect in law which may have come to its notice as a result of the learned Judge interpretation of Section In order to clarify the law Section of the Act of inserted a proviso at the end of Section which runs as follows Provided that where any person in the service of the Government and belonging to any of the classes aforesaid in the discharge or purported discharge of his official duty makes any arrangements or provides any facilities or does any other act or thing for to or in relation to any candidate or his agent or any other person acting with the consent of the candidate of his election agent whether by reason of the office held by the candidate or for any other reason such arrangements facilities or act or thing shall not be deemed to be assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate election Such a concession incidentally means that whatever facilities were given to the Prime Minister by the construction of rostrums or provision of power for the loudspeakers for which the party was also billed at least to the extent of one fourth of the expenses of the rostrums and wholly as regards the expenses of loudspeakers were given by the officers concerned in the performance of their official duties It appears to me that this amendment is merely clarificatory of the state of law as it really was even before the amendment On the view I take there is no question here of altering the rules of the game to the disadvantage of the election petitioner There is no attack on the validity of Section of the Act as it existed before the amendment Before I proceed further I may mention that I have dealt with the findings of the learned Judge assailed by the original respondent Appeal No of perhaps in greater length and depth after going through the evidence in the case than I had set out to do Secondly if the amendments were made necessary for reasons brought out fully only by dealing with facts and findings in this case they could not give rise to any grounds to suggest that there was anything wrong in making amendments to remove such reasons It appears to me as already indicated by me that the learned Judge was perhaps unduly conscious of the fact that he was dealing with the case of the Prime Minister of this country Nevertheless when it came to appraising evidence it seems to me that as I have already pointed out he applied unequal standards in assessing its worth so as to largely relieve the election petitioner of the very heavy onus of proof that lies on a party which challenges the verdict of the electors by allegations of corrupt practices In addition Section of the Act of has made the position on this point also very clear by providing that in Section of the Act in clause the following proviso shall be inserted at the end Provided that no symbol allotted under this Act to a candidate shall be deemed to be a religious symbol or a national symbol for the purposes of this clause It has been repeatedly laid down by this Court that the possibility of misuse of a power given by a statue cannot invalidate the provision conferring the power The only question argued with some seriousness in the election petitioner appeal was that the election expenses which form the subject matter of issue No had exceeded the limit of authorised expenditure imposed by Section of the Act read with Rule On this issue the learned Judge had considered every allegedly omitted item of expense very thoroughly and had reached the conclusion that the following items totaling upto Rs had to be added to the return of election expenses of the original respondent which mentioned items totaling upto Rs In the case before us two main questions and one subsidiary question each of which is a mixed question of fact and law which deserve consideration by the <ORG> on this issue have been raised before us I will deal with these questions briefly seriatim The first question is If the party which a candidate represents spends or others also spend some money on his or her election is this expenditure one which can be or should be properly included in the statement of election expenses submitted by the candidate Arguments before us have proceeded on the assumption made by both sides that some expenditure was incurred by <ORG> party and some expenditure must also have been incurred by those who either voluntarily helped or even thrust their supposed assistance whether it was helpful or not upon those managing the original respondent election which was not shown as part of her election expenses It may be contended that this would considerably inhibit the electoral campaign of political parties but we do not think so It is not necessary to quote further from the judgment which suggested taking of steps for reform of electoral machinery so as to ensure choice of candidates by popular participation in the process of nomination because that would take us into a territory beyond mere interpretation of the law as it exists It is enough to observe that the passages quoted above rest on the assumption that where there are special circumstances in a case which constitute a political party an implied agent of the candidate himself the candidate will be responsible Nevertheless unless and until there is a plea that something was spent by the <ORG> party either as an express or implied agent of the original respondent this loophole left in the petition would not suffice Section of the Act contains the mandatory provisions that the petition shall set forth full particulars of any corrupt practice that the petitioner alleges including as full a statement as possible of the names of parties alleged to have committed such corrupt practice and the date and place of the commission of each such practice Hence it appears to me that the amendment made by Act of by adding the explanation to Section of the Act could be justified as merely an attempt to restore the law as it had been understood to be previous to decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra Notwithstanding any judgment order or decision of any court to the contrary any expenditure incurred or authorised in connection with the election of a candidate by a political party or by any other association or body of persons or by any individual other than the candidate or his election agent shall not be deemed to be and shall not ever be deemed to have been expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorized by the candidate or by his election agent for the purposes of this sub section Provided that nothing contained in this Explanation shall effect a any judgment order or decision of <ORG> whereby the election of a candidate to <ORG> or to <ORG> has been declared void or set aside before the commencement of the Representation of the People Amendment Ordinance any judgment order or decision of <ORG> whereby the election of any such candidate has been declared void or set aside before the commencement of the said Ordinance if no appeal has been preferred to <ORG> against such judgment order or decision of <ORG> before such commencement and the period of limitation for filing such appeal has expired before such commencement It appears to me that both parties to the case now before us were under the impression that the expenses incurred by a political party over its candidate election was outside the prescribed limit which operated only against expenditure by a candidate himself In the written statement filed on behalf on the original respondent it was very frankly admitted that some expenditure incurred by the local <ORG> party itself had not been shown as election expenses of the candidate herself The second question which arises for consideration is if some expenses are shown or admitted to have been incurred by the candidate party or third persons over the election of the successful candidate is it possible to separate it from a total expenditure on more than one constituency by some process of estimation and apportionment Of course this question can only arise if it is first proved that whatever expenditure was incurred by candidate party or by some other person who may be a friend a relation or a sympathiser was incurred in circumstances from which it can be inferred that the successful candidate would reimburse the party or person who incurred it An attempt was then made to pass the responsibility on to the original respondent for the expenses of at least vehicles whose numbers are mentioned in a letter dated February written by <NAME> who was then the original respondent election agent and sent to the District Officer <NAME> stating as follows Sir I beg to say that <ORG> Rae Bareli has taken the following cars for election purposes in the three parliamentary constituencies Rae Bareli Amethi and Ram Sanehi Ghat On this evidence the learned Judge came to the conclusion that it was not possible to say which constituency Of that there is no evidence However as I have already held there is no case or evidence before us that the <ORG> party was the agent express or implied of the original respondent or acting as the channel through which any money whatsoever was spent by the original respondent I may now very shortly deal with the objection that as a number of members of <ORG> belonging to the opposition parties were in detention under the preventive detention laws which could not be questioned before courts of law because of the declaration of the emergency by the President there was a procedural defect in making the amendments of the Act of and the Thirty ninth Constitutional Amendment The validity of any proceedings in <ORG> shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure There is no provision of the Constitution which has been pointed out to us providing for any notice to us providing for any notice to each member of <ORG> I will now turn to the validity of clause of Article A sought to be added by Section of the Thirty ninth Amendment The validity of any such law as is referred to in clause and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court Where any person is appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> while an election petition referred to in clause of Article in respect of his election to either House of <ORG> or as the case may be to <ORG> is pending such election petition shall abate upon such person being appointed as Prime Minister or as the case may be being chosen to the office of the Speaker of <ORG> but such election may be called in question under any such law as is referred to in clause No law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith as it relates to election petition and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in clause to either House of <ORG> and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void or has before such commencement been declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by any court before such commencement declaring such election to be void such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of no effect Any appeal or cross appeal against any such order of any court as referred to in clause pending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act before <ORG> shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of clause The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution It was contended that the newly added Article A of the Constitution far from constituting a constitutional law which alone could be made under Article did not even satisfy the tests of a law inasmuch as it did not lay down any general rule applicable to all cases of a particular class but was really designed to decide one particular election case which is now before us for hearing in a particular way The essence of judicial or quasi judicial function is the application of a law which is already given by the law making authority to the judicial or quasi judicial authority to apply Could this be the ambit of constituent power in our Constitution Would such a view not defeat the whole purpose of a Constitution Does the whole Constitution so crumble and melt in the crucible of constituent power that its part cannot be made out Before we could accept a view which carries such drastic implications with it we will have to overrule the majority view in <NAME> case supra If constituent power by itself is so transcendental and exceptional as to be above the provisions of the Constitution itself it should not logically speaking be bound even by the procedure of amendment prescribed by Article I have not found any opinion expressed so far by any learned Judge of this Court to show that the constituent power is not bound by the need to follow the procedure laid down in Article of the Constitution Justice <NAME> once said Theory is the most important part of the dogma of law as the architect is the most important man who takes part in the building of a house It seems to me that the words sovereignty and sovereign power used repeatedly learned Counsel defending the Thirty ninth Amendment to describe the constituent power should for several good reasons be avoided so far as possible by lawyers who seek that clarity of thought for which precision in language is the first requirement The principle that Might was Right was recognised as the unquestioned legally operative principle at least in the field of their constitutional laws In later stages of Roman law Roman jurists also saturated with Greek notions of an ethically superior law of nature said that the institution of slavery which gave the owner of a slave theoretically absolute powers of life and death over the slave just like the powers of a pater familia over his children was contrary to just natural although it was recognised by jus gentium the laws of then civilised world They had the force of law or Lex which could be roughly equated with our statutory law After the break up of the Roman empire there were attempts in medieval Europe both by the <ORG> and the Kings to develop spiritual and temporal means for checking wrong and oppression Another theory however was than the messenger of God had given the sovereign will of God Almighty which governed all matters and this could not be departed from by any human authority or ruler There is an account of how the Caliph <NAME> being a defendant in a claim brought by a Jew for some money borrowed by him for purposes of <ORG> appeared in person in the Court of his own <NAME> But even according to <NAME> although the sovereign was free from the trammels of positive law as he was above it yet he was bound by divine law and the law of nature as well as by the common law of nations which embodies principles distinct from these See <NAME> History of Political Theories Ancient Medieval <NAME> said It is to this auguster thing not to such supreme power as English lawyers held to be vested in Parliament and King that <NAME> account of the sovereign is really applicable He also said at Where democracy exists there is still need to safeguard individuals and minorities against tyranny both because tyranny is undesirable in itself and because it is likely to lead to breaches of order A lamentable example of what took place in the course of English constitutional history when <ORG> composed of very intelligent and learned people one of whom <NAME> subsequently became a distinguished Chief Justice of England took upon itself to sit in judgment on a decision of two Judges of <ORG> one of whom was suspected of being a partisan of Royal prerogative and power at a time when a struggle for supremacy between the competing legal claims of the King as the titular sovereign and those of <ORG> as representing the people was still going on Let me go back a little further to the time when another English Chief Justice Sir <NAME> who on being summoned with his brother Judges by King <NAME> to answer why the King could not himself decide cases which had to go before his own courts of justice asserted no king after the conquest assumed to himself to give any judgment in any cause whatsoever which concerned the administration of justice within this realm but these were solely determined in the courts of justice When the King said that he thought the law was founded on reason and that he and others had reason as well as the Judges <NAME> answered True it was that God had endowed his Majesty with excellent science and great endowments of nature but his Majesty was not learned in the laws of his realm of England and causes which concern the life or inheritance or goods or fortunes of his subjects are not to be decided by natural reason but by the artificial reason and judgment of the law which law is an act which requires long study and experience before that a man can attain to the recognizance of it and that the law was the golden metwand and measure to try the causes of the subjects and which protected his Majesty in safety and peace It is a matter of legal and constitutional history that English judges finally rejected claims based upon vague philosophical concepts or upon a law of nature or appeals to the Yet auguster thing pitted against statutory law exception so far as certain rules of natural justice and reason could impliedly be read into Acts of <ORG> due to absence of statutory prohibition and the need to observe them having regard to the character of the function required by a statute to be performed This dictum of <ORG> announced in Dr <NAME> case was soon repudiated in England but the doctrine announced in <ORG> dictum found fertile soil in the United States and sprouted into such a vigorous growth that it was applied by <ORG> in the decision of cases coming before it and it has been said that the doctrine of the supremacy of <ORG> is the logical conclusion of <ORG> doctrine of control of the courts over legislation It seems to me that judicial review of all law making whether it appertains to the sphere of fundamental law or of ordinary law is traceable to the doctrine of judicial control by reference to certain basic principles contained in a Constitution and considered too inviolable to be easily alterable In America there was some doubt whether the doctrine of judicial review of all legislation naturally flowed out of the vesting of judicial power by Section of Article of their Constitution which says The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one <ORG> and in such inferior Courts as the <ORG> may from time to time ordain and establish There is no article there like Article of our Constitution which declared any kind of legislation abridging or taking away fundamental rights to be void The Constitution as the basic or fundamental law of the land was to operate there as the touchstone of the validity of ordinary laws just as the validity of laws made by British colonial legislatures was tested by reference to the parental Act of the British Parliament Article of the Constitution gives a wide power to <ORG> to issue directions or orders or writs which is larger than that of the British courts issuing prerogative writs although it is confined to the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III dealings with fundamental rights The term sovereign is only used in the preamble of our Constitution which says We the people of India having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens In our <ORG> this twenty sixth day of November do hereby adopt enact and give to ourselves this Constitution We have to presume that the Constitution was actually made by the people of India by virtue of their political sovereignty which enabled them to create a legally Sovereign Democratic Republic to which they consigned or entrusted through the Constitution the use of sovereign power to be exercised in its different forms by the three different organs of Government each acting on behalf of the whole people so as to serve the objects stated in the Preamble It has been pointed out in <NAME> case supra that the preamble of our Constitution did not like that of the American Constitution walk before the Constitution but was adopted after the rest of the Constitution was passed so that it is really a part of the Constitution itself Nevertheless the Constitution of the guarantees to citizens not merely fundamental rights including the right to work but has a special department of the Procurator General to enforce due observance of legality according to the law of the Constitution by all the functionaries of <ORG> Although Article of the Constitution of the speaks of the Sovereignty and Sovereign Rights of the Union Republic yet it is made clear that these republic function subject to the supremacy of the Constitution Moving within that circle and deciding upon those questions sovereignty will only make legal pronouncements is not a capricious power of doing anything in any way it is a legal power of settling finally legal questions in a legal way Indeed there are judicial dicta to the effect that God Himself considered Himself bound by those elementary principles of justice whose love was planted in man by Him The laws of <NAME> and man both give the party an opportunity to make his defence if he has any Adam says <NAME> where art thou Has thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat And the same question was put to Eve also That seems to me to be the essence of a Constitution and the rationale of its existence If there is a part of our Constitution which deserves greater devotion than any other part of it it is certainly the preamble to our Constitution It is no doubt true that the Constitution itself can be amended by the <ORG> but that is possible because Article of the Constitution can be validly made only by following the procedure prescribed by the said article Though this division of functions is not based on the doctrine of separation of powers as in the United <ORG>s yet there is a broad division of functions between the appropriate authorities so that for example the <ORG> will not be entitled to arrogate to itself the judicial function of adjudication After all the discussion that had taken place then came the Twenty fourth Amendment There are scattered dicta in the judgments of this Court speaking of the sovereignty of the people which in my opinion can only be related to the political sovereignty of the people recognised by the preamble to our Constitution where the people are described as the Constitution makers who gave the Constitution unto themselves Any order issued by such a ruler has the force of law and did govern the rights of the parties affected thereby It is evident from the quotation relied upon by the Solicitor General that this Court was not deciding whether the firman was even a law in the sense of a general norm which had to be applied to the decision of cases It was held that whatever be its juristic character it had the force of law inasmuch as the ruler of Udaipur was an absolute ruler who combined in his person the legislative the judicial and executive authority of the <ORG> I is true that in the exercise of the law making constituent power brought in by Section of the Indian Independence Act the <ORG> could be armed with judicial powers as well if appropriate laws were made to that effect I do not see how clause of Article A if it contained certain provisions on the assumption that such a judicial power was already there in <ORG> could be valid as a piece of mere law making For instance if the statute in question enumerates the matters over which a court has jurisdiction no other matters may be included It is interesting to note that in the Australian Constitution where there is Article using language very similar to that of Article of our Constitution there is also a separate but differently cast Article of the Australian Constitution corresponding to Article of our Constitution Moreover Article contained a temporary provision until other provision was made by <ORG> in that behalf It would be idle to contend that these provisions suddenly lapsed or ceased to exist as soon as <ORG> took up consideration of the issues and the grounds of the decision on them by <ORG> to which reference is made in Article A could only be a law making power and not any other power which could conceivably fall under Article Sub Article For a time there was a marked improvement in the decision of controverted elections The decision of the judge who has power to reserve his judgment until he has consulted the Common Pleas division of <ORG> in which these proceedings are instituted is final to all intents and purposes <ORG> being bound to give the necessary directions for confirming or altering the returns or for issuing a writ for a new election or carrying such determination into execution as circumstances may require And <ORG> had certainly the King in Parliment with the possible exception of the power to punish for its contempts I use the qualifying word possible because the more correct view of it today may be that this power is also as it is consid after citing the opinions of judges to whom a reference was made by <ORG> in <NAME> case that Lex Parliamenti seemed something as strange and peculiar as foreign law is for common law courts it was explained at page These views belonged to a time when the distinction between the judicial and legislative function of <ORG> was undrawn or only beginning to be drawn and when the separation of the Lords from the <ORG> was much less complete than it was in the seventeenth century Views about the High Court of <ORG> and its power which were becoming antiquated in the time of <NAME> continued to be repeated far into the eighteenth century although after the Restoration principles began to be laid down which were more in accord with the facts of the modern Constitution The confusions mentioned above misled some people in this country due to the provisions of Article of our Constitution on the question whether <ORG> had not only the power to punish a citizen for contempt but also to exercise what is really a judicial power to interpret and to determine the ambit of its own jurisdiction He pointed out that the only exception to this rule was the power to punish for its own contempt which since the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> could be thought of as a power of <ORG> even acquired as a kind of inheritance from the powers once possessed by the High <ORG> I do not think that <ORG> was itself ever a court One of the submissions of the learned Counsel for the election petitioner however was that inasmuch as the Constitution lays down the norms to which ordinary legislation must conform its proper sphere of operation is different from that ordinary legislation which takes place under the provisions of Articles to of the Constitution The majority view in <NAME> Case that Article prevails over Article was on the basis that there was no distinction between constituent and legislative power and an amendment of the Constitution was law and that such law attracted the opening words of Article which in its turn attracted the provisions of Article So long as this distinction is kept in mind <ORG> will have the power under Article to amend the Constitution It could be and has been argued not without force that there are no legal limitations upon the subject matter which may be considered fit for inclusion or incorporation in a Constitution I had said in <NAME> case supra after dealing with amending power in Article on the assumption that it was an exercise of a sovereign power at No doubt the judicial organ has to decide the question of the limits of a sovereign authority as well as that of other authorities in cases of dispute It said No law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be Similar provision is proposed to be made in the case of the election to either <ORG> or as the case may be to the House of the people of a person holding the office of Prime Minister or the Speaker This was that the whole procedure adopted and needed being a law making procedure and nothing more there was no need to look for norms or for law applied as no judicial or quasi judicial proceeding was involved As already indicated there is no provision anywhere for the exercise of overriding judicial or quasi judicial powers by <ORG> If Article A constituted only a piece of purported law making the next question which deserves very serious consideration by us is whether such purported law making is not fully covered by the undoubted law making power of <ORG> to make law prospectively as well as retrospectively inter alia to get rid of the legal effect or result of a judgment considered erroneous by it or to retrospectively validate an election it considers valid whatever may be its reasons for reaching this conclusion I will answer this question after considering the relevant case law cited on the subject Cases were also cited where rights having been altered during the pendency of proceedings courts had to give effect to the rights as altered and judgments already given on the strength of the previous law had ceased to have a binding force as res judicata between parties or had to be set aside where appeals against them were pending While in the main leaving our <ORG> and the State <ORG> supreme in their respective legislative fields our Constitution has by some of the articles pur upon the legislature certain specified limitations Our Constitution unlike the English Constitution recognises the court supremacy over the legislative authority but such supremacy is a very limited one for it is confined to the field where the legislative power is circumscribed by limitations put upon it by the Constitution itself <NAME> statement of law in the United States of America showing that retroactive legislation which does not impair vested or substantial rights or constitutional prohibitions is permissible and his conclusion relying on <NAME> Constitutional Limitations was also quoted The <ORG> does or may prescribe the rules under which the judicial power is exercised by the courts and in doing so it may dispense with any of those formalities which are not essential to the jurisdiction of the court and whatever it may dispense with by statute anterior to the proceedings we believe it may also dispense with by statute after the proceedings have been taken if the court has failed to observe any of those formalities But it would not be competent for the <ORG> to authorize a court to proceed and adjudicate upon the rights of parties without giving them an opportunity to be heard before it and for the same reason it would be incompetent for it by retrospective legislation to make valid any proceedings which had been had in the courts but which were void for want of jurisdiction over the parties But this <ORG> repelled this argument relying on principles laid down in <NAME> <NAME> supra If what has been done in Legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited in which category would of course be included any Act of the Imperial Parliament at variance with it it is not for any court of justice to inquire further or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions In this case decided by five Judges of this Court there was unanimity not he conclusion that <ORG> had power to retrospectively remove the disqualification of a candidate It seems to us that there is no force in this contention It has been held in numerous cases by this Court that the State Legislatures and <ORG> can legislate retrospectively subject to the provisions of the Constitution After the general election of it was found that the persons elected for the Coatbridge Division of Lanark and the Springbourn Division of Glasgow were disqualified at the time of their election because they were members of tribunals appointed by the Minister under the Rent of Furnished Houses Control Scotland Act which entitled them to a small fee in respect of attendance at a Tribunal Great stress was laid on the word declared in Article a but we are unable to imply any limitation on the powers of the <ORG> from this word The apprehension that it may not be a healthy practice and this power might be abused in a particular case are again no grounds for limiting the powers of <ORG> a petition complaining of no return shall be deemed to be a parliamentary election petition and <ORG> may make such order thereon as they think expedient for compelling a return to be made or may allow the petition to be heard by an election court as provided with respect to ordinary election petitions A statute attempting to do so has been held unconstitutional as an attempt on the part of the <ORG> is not only prohibited from reopening cases previously decided by the courts but is also forbidden to affect the inherent attributes of a judgment On the other hand learned Counsel supporting the validity of Article A relied on the following passage It is worthy of notice however that there are cases in which judgments requiring acts to be done in the future may validly be affected by subsequent legislation making illegal that which the judgment found to be legal or making legal that which the judgment found to be illegal They also pointed out With respect to legislative interference with a judgment a distinction has been made between public and private rights under which distinction a statute may be valid even though it renders ineffective a judgment concerning a public right No one it was urged could be herd to say that he had any vested or inherent right to challenge and election But as it is well established that it is the Constitution and not the constituent power which is supreme here in the sense that the constitutionality of the Constitution cannot be called in question before us but exercise of the constituent power can be we have to judge the validity of exercise of constituent power by testing it on the anvil of constitutional provision But we have to decide legal questions even if they have as many legal issues have political consequences and repercussions which we cannot entirely ignore Perhaps we have to go back to <NAME> <NAME> supra were Chief Justice <NAME> said at The very essence of civil liberty consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws whenever he receives an injury In all other cases he says it is a general and indisputable rule that where there is a legal right there is also a legal remedy by suit or action at law whenever that right is invaded I have dealt with the merits of the case to show that from the legal aspect ection petitioner grievances could have any real legal foundations I think that this is a basic consideration which must compel us in the light of the principles laid down by us in <NAME> case supra to hold that we must look into his grievances and determine for ourselves where his case stood on the law before it was amended The question which arises now is Was clause of Article A read with clauses and really meant to bar our jurisdiction to consider the grievances of the petitioner and to decide them or can they be so interpreted as to preserve this <ORG> jurisdiction Broadly speaking the election petitioner has two heads of grievance firstly that the election of the original respondent is vitiated by corrupt practices which as I have indicated after considering the case set up by him and the evidence tendered and the law applicable could not possibly succeed even under the law as it stood before the amendment and secondly that our very jurisdiction to go into these grievances is sought to be debarred by clauses and of Article A with the political object of stifling opposition and therefore according to the election petitioner we must declare clause and the connected clauses and of Article A to be invalid Indeed so far as the original respondent is concerned the effect of clauses and of Article A would be if we were to hold that they bar our jurisdiction to go into the merits of the appeals under Section A of the Act that her grievance against the judgment under appeal also could not be gone into or dealt with In other words the original respondent would also be denied an opportunity of asserting her rights under the Act and of vindicating her stand in the case by showing that there was really no sustainable ground for the findings given by the learned Judge of <ORG> against her We would therefore be prevented from doing justice to her case as well if we were to accept the contention that the Thirty ninth Amendment bars our jurisdiction to hear the appeals under Section A of the Act on merits Undoubtedly clause of Article A could be said to have a political objective in the context in which it was introduced and we could perhaps take judicial notice of this context It is a well established canon of interpretation that out of two possible interpretations of a provision one which prevents it from becoming unconstitutional should be preferred if this is possible ut res magis valeat quam pereat It is true that the deeming provision seems to stand in the way of our examination of the merits of the case even though there is no direct provision taking away our jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeals before us The some view has been expressed by this Court in other cases I <NAME> I <ORG> Mad In Ex parte <NAME> In Re <NAME> <NAME> When a statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been done which in fact and in truth was not done then the court is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purposes and between what persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted to In other words we have to examine the context and the purpose of the legal fiction and confine its effects to these I have come to the conclusion as indicated above that Appeal No must be allowed and the Cross Appeal No of must fail <ORG> held that the successful candidate was guilty of having committed two corrupt practices within the meaning of Section of the Representation of the People Act firstly she obtained the assistance of the gazetted officers of <ORG> for furthering her election prospects and secondly she obtained the assistance of <NAME> a gazetted officer in <ORG> holding the post of Officer on Special Duty in the Prime Minister Secretariat for furthering the same purpose The Representation of the People Amendment Ordinance providing that Notwithstanding any judgment order or decision of any court to the contrary any expenditure incurred or authorized in connection with the election of a candidate by a political party or by any other association or body of persons or by any individual other than the candidate or his election agent shall not be deemed to be and shall not ever be deemed to have been expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorized by the candidate or by his election incurred or authorized by the candidate or by his election agent In view of his finding that the total amount of expenditure incurred or authorized by the successful candidate or her election agent together with the amount proved to have been incurred by the political party or <ORG> in concussion with her election did not exceed the prescribed limit the learned Judge thought it unnecessary to inquire into the constitutionality of the ordinance and the Act of An appeal was filed to <ORG> of <ORG> from the aforesaid order but by consent of parties this Court decided to hear the points involved in the writ petition and in the appeal therefrom It also takes care of a considerable gamut of the appeal filed in this Court by the defeated candidate The amendments brought about by Act of and Act of have an incisive impact on the cross appeals but their edge was blunted by the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act which came into force on August The new Article which replaces its precursor empowers the <ORG> to pass laws regulating the elections of the President and the Vice President including the making of provision for the decision of disputes relating to their election Article A has six clauses out of which the first three deal with the future election to the <ORG> of persons holding the office of Prime Minister of Speaker at the time of the election or who are appointed to these Under the majority judgment <ORG> alone called by virtue of a law to be passed under entry of List I could abridge or take away the fundamental rights The eleven judgments delivered in that case are reported in <NAME> State of Keral commonly known as the Fundamental Rights case accepted the contention of the petitioners that though Article conferred the power to amend the Constitution and therefore Article did not confer power to amend the Constitution so as to damage or destroy the essential elements or basic features of the Constitution could not therefore be abrogated or emasculated in the exercise of the power conferred by Article though a reasonable abridgment of those rights could be effected in the public interest On that question the arguments of Mr <NAME> who appears for <NAME> may be summed up thus i The Thirty ninth Amendment affects the basic structure or framework or the institutional pattern adopted by the <ORG>tion and is therefore beyond the amending power conferred by Article For example the power to appoint or dismiss a government servant or the power to declare war which are executive powers cannot be exercised by <ORG> <NAME> did not dispute the contention that the appeals before us must be disposed of on the basis of the law laid down by the majority in the Fundamental Rights case It will serve no useful purpose to take up each one of the points for separate consideration and indeed many an argument is interrelated This Court has strictly adhered to the view that in constitutional matters one must decide no more than is strictly necessary for an effective adjudication of the points arising in any case Clause of Article A which is the real focus of controversy may conveniently be split up as follows for understanding its true nature and effect i The laws made by <ORG> prior to August in so far as they relate to election petitions and matters connected therewith cease to apply to the parliamentary election of Smt <NAME> which took place in Whether this contention is sound is another matter but I do not see the force of the argument of the Attorney General that in view of the decisions in <NAME> case supra <NAME> case supra and the Fundamental Rights case supra the contention is not open to be taken There was some discussion at the <ORG> as to which features of the Constitution form the basic structure of the Constitution according to the majority decision in the Fundamental Rights case I consider it beyond the pale of reasonable controversy that if there be any unamendable features of the Constitution on the score that they form a part of the basic structure of the Constitution they are that i India is a sovereign democratic republic ii Equality of status and opportunity shall be secured to all its citizens iii The State shall have no religion of its own and all persons shall be equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practice and propagate religion and that iv the nation shall be governed by a Government of laws not of men Judicial review according to <NAME> is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and since the Thirty ninth Amendment by Article A and deprives the courts including <ORG> of their power to adjudicate upon the disputed election the amendment is unconstitutional Article expressly took away the power of <ORG> to grant special leave to appeal from the decisions of any court or tribunal constituted by a law relating to the armed forces The provision contained in Article is decisive on the question under consideration In fact until the passing of the Representation of the People Amendment Act of by which <ORG> were given jurisdiction to try election petitions that jurisdiction was vested first in a tribunal consisting of three members and later in a tribunal consisting of a single member who was to be a sitting District Judge Thus in England the election <ORG> is constituted by a special method it exercises a jurisdiction out of the ordinary jurisdiction which is normally exercised a jurisdiction out of the Equally there is no substance in the contention that the relevant clauses of the Thirty ninth Amendment are in total derogation of political justice and are accordingly unconstitutional And <NAME> defined <ORG>y as the rule of the poor simply because they formed always and necessarily the more numerous class But the word is commonly used in the sense of the rule of the majority of the community as a whole including classes and masses Very often as said by Sir <NAME> If there is any real danger it is of the alarmist own making The preamble to our Constitution by which the people of Indira resolved solemnly to secure to all its citizens equality of status and opportunity finds its realization in an ampler measure in Article which guarantees equality before the law and the equal protection of laws to all persons citizens and non citizens alike The election of the Prime Minister could not be declared void as there was no law to apply to that election the judgment of <ORG> declaring the election void is itself void and the election continues to be valid as it was before <ORG> pronounced its judgment It is true that the right though expressed in an absolute form is hedged in by a judge made restriction so that the same law will not apply to all persons alike or different laws may govern the rights and obligations of different persons falling within distinct classes This <ORG> at least since the days of <NAME> case has consistently taken the view that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differential which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those who are left out and that the differential must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the particular <ORG> therefore pursued the policy of pick and choose to see what suited the genius of the nation best If it records findings it does so without a pleading and without framing any issues The argument regarding the invalidity of the Representation of the People Amendment Act of and of the Election Laws Amendment Act has however no substance Ordinary laws have to answer two tests for their validity The law must be within the legislative competence of the <ORG> as defined and specified in Chapter I Part XI of the Constitution and it must not offend against the provisions of Article and of the constitution No objection can accordingly be taken to the constitutional validity of the two impugned Acts on the ground that they damage or destroy the basic structure Finally there is no merit in the contention that the constitutional amendment is bad because it was passed when some members of the <ORG> were in detention
