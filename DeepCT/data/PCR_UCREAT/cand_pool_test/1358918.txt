There is no collusion between the parties There is no proof of connubial intercourse after the adultery which would be a prima facie evidence of condonation The petitioner has not slumbered in sufficient comfort and there is no unreasonable delay in presenting the petition There is a letter of the husband to the wife in the present case Ext There is no other letter There is no other item of the conduct of the husband which is admitted and which is consistent with the contents of the said letter There is an old legal maxim in Scotland which runs as follows Solus cum sole in suspecto loco non presumitur dicere pater noster which being translated means that when a man and a woman are found together under suspicious circumstances it cannot be presumed that they are saying their prayers The evidence in the present case satisfies the above tests I am not unmindful of the general notions that the proceeding under Section of the Act has no exact parallel in other countries that the petition for divorce is not of the nature of an undefended civil suit that such cases are not to be decided on ground of sympathy and that it is also not enough for one of the parties to come forward and say exactly following the terms of the Act but it seems to me repugnant that <ORG> should be so little in accord with the common notions of mankind that it should require the evidence to displace fantastic suggestions Reluctant as I am as a matter of general principle to dissolve a union unless it becomes impossible to allow it to continue and there are compelling circumstances in favour of dissolution in all the circumstances of this case I think I should be going far beyond any other authorities and should be ignoring altogether the paramount consideration applicable to such cases viz I find that there is sufficient legal evidence to support the decree
