PETITIONER STATE OF Vs RESPONDENT RAM CHANDRA TRIVEDI DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> JASWANT BENCH <NAME> JASWANT KHANNA HANS RAJ SARKARIA RANJIT <NAME> CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO RF SC SC SC RF SC SC SC SC SC ACT Pracctice Duty of <ORG> when there is conflict between decisions of <ORG> Upsetting concurrent findings of fact in second appeal Propriety The Executive Engineer obtained explanations from both the clerks and reported the matter to the Superintending Engineer who brought the matter to the notice of the ChiefEngineer The respondent filed a suit challenging the order on the ground that the termination was one passed by way of punishment and therefore attracted Art of the constitution But the <ORG> went through the official correspondence preceding the passing of the impugned order and observing that a close scrutiny of the facts on record showed that the order was passed by way of punishment on the basis of the enquiry proceeding and as a result of the recommendation by the Executive Engineer followed by the direction issued by Chief Engineer allowed the second appeal An examination of the deci sions of this <ORG> shows that there is no real conflict in their ratio decidendi Even if there is a conflict the proper course for a <ORG> is to find out and follow the opinion expressed by larger benches of this <ORG> in preference to those expressed by smaller benches of this <ORG> Before it is held that an order terminating the services of a <ORG> servant amounts to punishment the <ORG> must hold that either of the two tests namely a that the servant had a right to the post or that he had been visited with evil consequences such as forfeiture of pay etc Therefore an order terminating the services of a temporary servant or probationer under the Rules of employment and without anything more will not attract Art Even though misconduct negli gence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive for the order of termination if a right exists under the contract or the rules to terminate his services then Art Where there are no express words in the impugned order itself which throw a stigma on the <ORG> servant the <ORG> would not delve into secretariat files to discover whether some kind of stigma could be inferred on such research Under the contract of service and the service rules applicable to him the <ORG> had the right to terminate his services by giving him one month notice The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and decree dated January of <ORG> at Allahabad setting aside the judgment and decree dated July of the Second Additional Civil Judge Jhansi whereby the latter affirmed the judg ment and decree of the trial Court dismissing the respond ent suit for declaration that order dated November passed by <ORG> Jhansi terminating the services of the respondent was void and ineffective in law and he was entitled to recover a sum of Rs The facts leading to this appeal are The respondent herein was appointed as a temporary clerk in Gur Sarain Canal Division Jhansi The Superintending Engineer thereafter issued orders terminating the services of both the clerks The suit was resisted by the appellant on the ground that the respondent was only a temporary hand that under the contract of service as also the rules applicable to tempo rary Government servants the respondent was liable to be discharged any time even though an enquiry in respect of a charge of misconduct might have been insti tuted against him and that the impugned order not having been passed a measure of punishment but being a simple order of termination of the respondent services without casting any stigma on him or visiting him with evil conse quences was valid both under the aforesaid rules and the contract of service The grounds of attack made against the impugned order did not find favour with the trial Court which dismissed the suit Dissatisfied with these judgments the respondent preferred a second appeal to <ORG> which as already stated was allowed by a learned Single Judge of that Court While oversetting the concurrent findings of fact ar rived at by the courts below and decreeing the respondent aforesaid suit the learned single Judge went through the official correspondence preceding the passing of the im pugned order and observed that a close scrutiny of the facts on record showed that the order was passed by way of punish ment on the basis of the enquire proceedings and as a result of the recommendation made by the Executive Engineer fol lowed by the direction issued by the Chief Engineer that the respondent should be suitably punished It is against this judgment and decree that the present appeal has been pre ferred by the State of Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has urged that <ORG> acted illegally in reversing the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the courts below and quashing the impugned order which was a simple order of termination of the respondent services and had been validly passed in accordance with the rules relat ing to temporary <ORG> servants and the contract of service He has further contended that the learned Single Judge could not probe into the departmental files to support his finding that the impugned order was passed against the respondent by way of punishment It would in our opinion be appropriate at the outset to refer to the I decisions of this Court which have an important bearing on the instant that the termination of service by compulsory retirement in terms of specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to the infliction of punishment and does not attract Article But if the servant has no right to the post as where he is appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an officiating basis and whose temporary service has not ripened into a quasi permanent service as defined in the Temporary Service Rules the termination of his employment does not deprive him of any right and cannot therefore by itself be a punishment One test for determining whether the termination of the service of a <ORG> servant is by way of punishment is to ascertain whether the servant but for such termination had the right to hold the post If he had a right to the post as in the three cases hereinbefore mentioned the termination of his service will by itself be a punishment and he will be entitled to the protection of Article To put it in another way if the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to terminate the employment at any time then such termination in the manner provided by the contract or the rules is prima facie and per se not a punishment and does not attract the provi sions of Art service of a <ORG> servant who has no right to his post where he was appointed to a post temporary or permanent either on probation or on an officiating basis and had not acquired a quasi permanent status the termina tion cannot in any circumstance be dismissal or removal from service by way of punishment Cases may arise where the <ORG> may find a servant unsuitable for the post on account of misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification If such a servant was appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an offciating basis then the very transitory character of the employment implies that the employment was terminable at any time on reasonable notice given by the <ORG> In both cases the <ORG> may proceed to take action against the servant in exercise of its powers under the terms of the contract of employment express or implied or under the rules regulating the conditions of service if any be applicable and ordinarily in such a situation the <ORG> will take this course has been such that he deserves a punishment entailing penal consequences In such a case the <ORG> may choose to proceed against the servant on the basis of his misconduct negligence inefficiency or the like and inflict on him the punishment of dismissal removal or reduction carrying with it the penal consequences In such a case the servant will be entitled to the protection of Art The position may therefore be summed up as follows Any and every termination of service is not a dismissal removal or reduction in rank Likewise the termination of service by compulsory retire ment in terms of a specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to the infliction of a punish ment and does not attract Art In short if the termination of service is founded on the right flowing from contract of the service rules then prima facie the termination is not a punishment and carries with it no evil consequences and so Art But even if the <ORG> has by contract or under the rules the right to terminate the employment without going through the procedure prescribed for inflicting the punish ment of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank the <ORG> may nevertheless choose to punish the servant and if the termination of service is sought to be founded on misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification then it is a punishment and the requirements of Art As already stated if the Servant has got a right to continue in the post then unless the contract of employment or the rules provide to the contrary his services cannot be termi nated otherwise than for misconduct negligence ineffi ciency or other good and sufficient cause for it operates a forfeiture of his right and he is visited with the evil consequences of loss of pay and allowances It puts an indelible stigma on the officer affecting his future career If the <ORG> servant has a right to a particular rank then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty for he will then lose the emoluments and privi leges of that rank If however he has no right to the particular rank his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his substantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment But the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a tower post or rank cannot in any circum stances be a punishment The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences Thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the <ORG> had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules in truth and reality the <ORG> has terminated the employment as and by way A I Bom The use of the expression terminate or discharge is not conclusive In spite of the use of such innocuous expressions the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to If the case satisfied either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as which give protection to Government servant have not been complied with the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the constitutional right of the servant In <NAME> Union of India it was held by this Court that if the Government proceeded against the probationer in the direct way without casting any aspersion on his honesty or competence his discharge would not have the effect of removal by way of punishment but if instead of taking the easy course the Government chose the more difficult one of holding an enquiry into his alleged miscon duct and branded him as a dishonest and incompetent officer it would attract Article of the Constitution It was fur ther held in that case that it is only when the Government decides to hold a regular departmental enquiry for the purpose of inflicting one of the three major punishment that the Government servant gets the protection of Article The services of a temporary servant or a probationer can be terminated under the rules of his employment and such termination without any thing more would not attract the operation of Art The circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination of service have to be examined in each case the motive behind it being immaterial If the order visits the public servant with any evil consequences or casts an aspersion against his character or integrity it must be considered to be one by way of punishment no matter whether he was a mere probationer or a temporary servant An order of termination of service in unex ceptionable form preceded by an enquiry launched by the superior authorities only to ascertain whether the public servant should be retained in service does not attract the operation of Art i an Enquiry Officer is appointed a charge sheet submitted explanation called for and considered and order of termina tion of service made thereafter will attract the operation of the said Article where it was laid down that the test for attracting Article of the Constitution is whether the misconduct or negligence is a mere motive for the order of reversion or termination of service or whether it is the very foundation of the order of termination of service of the temporary employee The entirety of circumstances preceding or attendant on the impugned order must be examined by the court and the over riding test will always be whether the misconduct is a mere motive or is the very foundation of the order In <NAME> <ORG> to which one of us brother <NAME> was a party it was made clear in unambiguous terms that it may be taken to be well settled that even though misconduct negligence ineffi ciency or other disqualifications may be the motive or the inducing factor which influence the Government to take action under the express or implied terms of the contract of employment or under the statutory rule nevertheless if a right exists under <NAME> the contract or the rules to terminate the services the motive operating on the mind of the Governments is wholly immaterial An order terminating the services of a temporary servant or probationer under the Rules of Employment and without anything more will not attract Article It would also be seen that in that case on a representation being made by the respondent to the then Chief Minister of the <ORG> the latter after consideration of the matter had ordered that in view of the respondent previous good record he did not deserve the punishment of termination of service only on account of a few bad reports and that the respondent should continue in service and his case should be reviewed after he earned another report from <ORG> for the year The following observations made in <NAME> case supra should suffice to clear the doubts that may still be lurking in some quarters as to the ratio decidendi of <NAME> case supra We think that the principles involved in applying Article having been sufficiently explained in <NAME> case supra it should no longer be possible to urge that <NAME> case supra could give rise to some misapprehension of the law Indeed we do not think that the principles of law declared and applied so often have really changed have come up to this Court could create the impres sion sometimes that there is some conflict between different decisions of this Court It is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and cir cumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar One addition al or different fact can make a world of differ ence between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to simi lar facts This Court judgment in <NAME> case supra shows that it was only following the law on Article of the Constitution as laid down repeatedly earlier by this Court Thus on a conspectus of the decisions of this <ORG> referred to above it is obvious that there is no real conflict in their ratio decidendi and it is no longer open to any one to urge with any show of force that the consti tutional position emerging from the decisions of this <ORG> in regard to cases of the present nature is not clear It is also to be borne in mind that even in cases where <ORG> finds any conflict between the views expressed by larger and smaller benches of this <ORG> it cannot disregard or skirt the views expressed by the larger bench es It is also not denied that both under the contract of service and the service rules governing the respondent the <ORG> had a right to terminate his services by giving him one month notice We also find ourselves in agreement with the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> failed to appreciate the true legal and constitutional position and upset the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the <ORG> below that the impugned order was not by way of punishment ignoring the well settled principle of law that a second appeal cannot be In the result we allow the appeal set aside the judg ment and decree of <ORG> restore the judgments and decrees of the <ORG> below and dismiss the respond ent suit
