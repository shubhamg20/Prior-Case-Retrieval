In appeal to this Court it was contended that the award was liable to be set aside because the contracts of sale were misconstrued and the error appeared on the face of the award several documents bearing on the scope of the sales were not considered the umpire went beyond his jurisdiction when he awarded compensation to the respondent because the appellant removed certain vehicles that the umpire acted as a conciliator deciding matters on conjecture that the umpire fixed ground rent payable by the appellants without any evidence and that the costs awarded were totally disproportionate Therefore even when an arbitrator commits a mistake either in law or in fact in determining the matters referred to him explanations given by various officers of the respondent formed part of the contract and were binding on the respondent and both the questions having been referred to arbitration the umpires findings on them would bind the parties unless he laid down any legal proposition such as a construction which is made the basis of the award and is on the face of the award erroneous The award showed that the umpire had considered besides the sale notes the oral and documentary evidence led by the parties as also the contentions urged by counsel If there was an error in such a case it could not be said to an error appearent on the face of the award entitling the court to consider the various documents placed before the umpire but not incorporated in the award so as to form part of it and then to make a search if they had been misconstrued by him without going into details it could not be said that he bad acted without evidence or that he behaved in the matter as a conciliator or gave findings on conjuncture and surmises especially when the appellant withheld relevant evidence which was in its possession the appellant was bound to pay to the respondent ground rent and other charges which the respondent in its turn was liable to pay the owners and since it was not the appellant case that the respondent had claimed a higher amount there was no sub stance in the contention that the arbitrator fixed the ground rent without any evidence The Judgment of the Court has delivered by <NAME> By this appeal under special leave the appellantcompany challenges the correctness of the judgment of <ORG> dated February refusing to set aside an umpire award dated March Declining however to set aside the award he remitted it for reconsideration of the aforesaid items and also for readjustment of the amount of costs in the evert of enhanced compensation being awarded to the company in respect of its claim No a Dissatisfied with the judgment of the court the company filed an appeal before <ORG> Before we proceed to consider these propositions it is necessary to ascertain the scope of of the Arbitration Act and the principles underlying that section The principle is that the <ORG> while examining an award will look at documents accompanying and forming part of the award On an application to set aside the award <ORG> held that inasmuch as the umpire had referred to the contract and the terms thereof it was justified in looking at the contract and having done so found that he had based his decision entirely upon the terms of the contract see <NAME> <ORG> I In an illuminating analysis of a large number of earlier decisions including Landauer and <ORG> <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> recorded his conclusion thus It seems to me therefore that on the cases there is none which compels us to hold that a mere reference to the contract in the award entitles us to look at the contract award or in a document appended to or incorporated in it so as to form part of it the award will neither be remitted nor set aside notwithstanding the mistake In the light of the principle above stated the first question calling for determination is is there an error apparent on the award in the sense that the umpire misconstrued the contracts of sale inasmuch as though those contracts were contained in sale notes as well as in several letters he considered the sale notes only as containing the contracts of sale disregarding the corres pondence which had taken place between the company and the Director General Disposals and his officers Such a question would undoubtedly be one of law There were in all three separate sales to the appellant company which according to the respondents were incorporated in sale notes Nos with the following words Pending detailed record of terms tomorrow the following are the broad heads of agreement which will form the basis of sale of surplus vehicles It however appears from the judgment of <ORG> para that on receipt of sale note the company wrote a letter on July in which it contended that We have purchased the entire vehicle depot of <ORG> I have given the whole matter my most serious and earnest consideration and my view is that apart from the language of the two saledeeds being against such a contention the evidence too considered as a whole does not support it These passages clearly show that the umpire had considered besides the sale notes the oral and documentary evidence led by the parties as also the contentions urged on and as regards them by counsel for the company But questions both of fact and law were referred to the umpire and prima facie his findings on them would bind the parties unless as explained earlier the umpire has laid down any legal proposition such as a construction which is made the basis of the award and is on the face of the award an error It is clearly a case falling in the category of cases like <NAME> <ORG> wherein deciding the questions referred to him the umpire has to decide a point of law account the entire evidence including the documents relied on by counsel and then only came to the conclusion that it did not assist the company in its contention as to the scope of the sales There is no dispute that out of these vehicles the company removed vehicles alleging that the delivery of the balance of vehicles was withheld The argument in connection with this part of the award was firstly that the findings of the umpire were vitiated as there was total lack of evidence on which they could be based and secondly that in any event the umpire had no jurisdiction to award compensation to the Government in respect of counterclaim No VI The first part of the argument need not detain us as the finding that these vehicles formed part of reciprocal aid articles the ownership in which vested in <ORG> and were therefore not A was based on the agreement between the two Governments and the inventories produced before the umpire from which he could hold that they belonged to <ORG> from the date when the installations in which they were incorporated were relinquished by the forces and that therefore they could not form the subject matter of sale note which related only to <ORG> If in determining that question he came to the conclusion that they did not the obvious conclusion would be that the company was not entitled to take away vehicles admittedly removed by it from the <ORG> Counsel argued that this part of the award was vague and without any evidence to support it and therefore the umpire behaved in this respect more like aconcilliator than as an arbitrator Even though as the judgment of <ORG> discloses para there was evidence both oral and documentary that the company had collected a number of vehicles lying at places outside the <ORG> and the vehicles so collected were recorded by the company yet the company had withheld the production of those records There is hardly any substance in this contention The <ORG> had a statutory obligation therefore to pay to the owners of those sites compensation as provided by those Rules In our view none of the six contentions urged by counsel can be upheld
