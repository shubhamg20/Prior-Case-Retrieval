HEADNOTE During the pendency of two connected suits for recovery of money filed by the appellant in <ORG> one of the respondents died and his sons daughters and grand daughters were joined in the suits as his legal representatives as holding different pieces of his property under a deed of settlement and a registered will executed by him The respondents contended inter alia that they did not submit to the jurisdiction of <ORG> as it had no jurisdiction over them and the foreign judgments of that Court were not binding on them Under of the Code of Civil Procedure the clause a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person must include legatees under wills and that Estate cannot necessarily mean the whole of the estate The Judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR This appeal has been brought to this <ORG> with a certificate issued by <ORG> under Art Thereupon the appellant joined the present respondents to in those two suits as legal representatives of <NAME> on the ground that they were in possession of different pieces of his properties under a settlement deed of and a registered will executed by him on August Ex In both the suits the appellant obtained decrees with costs on October The said decrees directed respondent to pay the whole of the amount claimed by the appellant against him and respondents to to pay Rs Whilst the suits were pending the goods pledged in Suit No were auctioned and the sale proceeds realised which amounted to Rs Respondent for himself and as guardian of his minor sons resisted the appellant claim and contended that the Hyderabad <ORG>s had no jurisdiction over them and therefore the decrees passed by <ORG> was without jurisdiction They also alleged that they had not been served with notice of suit and had not submitted to the jurisdiction of <ORG> Respondent did not resist the suit but his sons did He held that <ORG> of Hyderabad had jurisdiction to try the suits and that the contesting respondents were bound by the decrees passed in the said suits The other issues framed by the trial court in respect of the other contentions raised by the respondents were also found against them In the result a decree was passed in favour of the appellant for the amounts respectively claimed by it against respondent and against the assets of <NAME> in the hands of respondents to with interest at per cent It was urged by the two sets of respondents in their two appeals that the trial court was in error in holding that <ORG> was a Court of competent jurisdiction and that the decrees passed by it were valid It was also urged that the decrees in question were contrary to natural justice and that respondents to were in fact not the legal representatives of <NAME> and so <ORG> acted illegally in passing the said decrees against them <ORG> has upheld the first contention raised by the respondents and has held that <ORG> of Hyderabad which passed the decrees was not competent to try the suits and so the decrees cannot be enforced by a suit under a of the Code of Civil Procedure It is against this decision that the appellant has come to this Court with a certificate issued by <ORG> The first question which falls to be considered in the present appeal is whether <ORG> at Hyderabad was a Court of competent jurisdiction when it pronounced the judgments in the two suits filed by the appellant in that Court It has been thus enunciated by <NAME> in rule When the defendant in an action in personam is at the time of the service of the writ not in England the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain the action In this connection it has been urged before us by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant that in considering the effect of the rule of private international law on which the High <ORG> has relied it may be relevant to remember that the recent judicial decisions disclose a healthily tendency to relex the rigour of the said rule In fact Mr <NAME> has invited our attention to Exception which Dicey has stated as one of the exceptions to the rule Under this Exception whenever any person out of England is a necessary or a proper party to an action properly brought against some other person duly served with a writ in England the <ORG> may assume jurisdiction to entertain an action against such first mentioned person as a co defendant in the action Pp In support of this argument Mr <NAME> has also invited our attention to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> The husband remarriage however proved unsuccessful and so in he obtained a decree for divorce on the ground that the Australian decree was invalid because at the time it was granted neither husband nor wife was domiciled in New South Wales and the wife by remarrying had been guilty of adultery Causes Act No of and the English <ORG>s by of the Matrimonial Causes Act claimed the same jurisdiction and it would be contrary to principle and inconsistent with comity if the <ORG>s of this Country refused to recognise a jurisdiction which mutates mutandis they claimed for themselves and that even if while in desertion the husband had reverted to his English domicile of origin <ORG> would not be deprived of jurisdiction We ought however to add that on two subsequent occasions the principle enunciated in the case of <NAME> it has been said should be confined to the special facts and features of that case In support of his argument Mr <NAME> has also invited our attention to the obiter observations made by <ORG> in In Re Dulles Settlement No it is at the commencement or the initiation of the suit that the rule has to be applied and if that is so there is no doubt that the two suits in <ORG> at Hyderabad were competent when they were brought and <ORG> at Hyderabad which tried them had jurisdiction to try them In form the claim made by the appellant against respondents to in <ORG> was in the nature of a personal claim but in substance the appellant would be entitled to execute its decree only against the assets of the deceased <NAME> in the hands of respondents to If the suits originally brought by the appellant in Hyderabad were competent how could it be said that they ceased to be competent merely because one of the defendants died <ORG> had jurisdiction to try the suits when they were filed and there is nothing in the rule of private international law to suggest that the said jurisdiction automatically came to an end as soon as one of the defendants died leaving as his legal representatives persons who were nonresident foreigners To hold otherwise would lead to this result that the suits against <NAME> would abate on his death though the cause of Action survives and the decree passed against his assets in the hands of his legal representatives can be effectively executed <ORG> terminated on the death of <NAME> so far as the appellant claim against him was concerned land the same cannot avail against his legal representatvies and it has observed that there is judicial authority in I support of this conclusion It is necessary to refer to the relevant facts in that case in order to appreciate the point which was decided by the Full Bench Similarly in the same context and while rejecting the said argument <NAME> observed that as soon as a man dies he disappears from the record and there is no party over whom the <ORG> can exercise jurisdiction and it loses jurisdiction in one of its essentials It would be noticed that these observations on which the High <ORG> has relied must be read in the context of the facts before the <ORG> in that case and their effect must be appreciated in the light of the argument which was rejected have to be taken or not and it has held that when a judgment debtor dies no action can be taken against his estate unless his legal representative is brought on the record and orders are then passed against the assets of the deceased in his hands In our opinion therefore the observations made in that case cannot pressed into service when we are dealing with a very different problem It is thus clear that the problem posed before <ORG> in that case was very much different from the problem with which we are concerned in the present appeal and so the observations made in that case cannot be of any assistance to the respondents in support of their contention that <ORG> ceased to have jurisdiction over the suit because on the death of <NAME> his legal representatives were non resident foreigners Going back to the narrow point which calls for our decision in the present appeal we are inclined to hold that there is no scope for the application of the rule of private international law to a case where the suit as initially filed was competent and the <ORG> before which it was filed had jurisdiction to try it That takes us to the other argument raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondents Section provides inter alia that a legal representative means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased <NAME> examined the several judicial decisions bearing on the point and observed from this review of the authorities it will appear that judicial decisions have extended the sense of the term legal representative beyond that of its ordinarily meaning of administrator executor and heir and though such extension has been attended with doubt and has in some cases been the subject of conflicting decision it appears to me to be too late now to endeavour however convenient it might be to secure for the term that which is perhaps its strict and legitimate sense I agree there fore in holding that the term is not limited to administrators executors and heirs and am of opinion that it must now be held to include any person who in law represents the estate of a deceased judgment debtor The whole object of widening the scope of the expression legal representative which the present definition is intended to achieve would be frustrated if it is held that legatees of different portions of the estate of a deceased do not fall within its purview In regard to the intermeddlers they are said to represent the estate even though they are in possession of parcels of the estate of the deceased and so there should be no difficulty in holding that the clause a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person must include different lega tees under the will There is no justification for holding that the Estate in the context must mean the whole of the estate We have also held that respondents to are the legal representatives of the deceased <NAME> and so it follows that the estate of the deceased <NAME> was sufficiently represented by them when the said judgments were pronounced In the result the appeal must be allowed the decrees passed by <ORG> in the two appeal Nos and of must be reversed and the decree of the trial court passed in Civil Suit No of restored with costs throughout
