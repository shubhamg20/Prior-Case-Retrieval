The Bombay <ORG> paid up their share of this excess expenditure in accordance with the bills submitted to them by the plaintiffs has remained unpaid and the plaintiffs are seeking to recover this amount together with interest from the Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council The plaintiffs have since filed a suit in this Court claiming certain amounts in respect of short payments made during such subsequent years The defendant filed his written statement on June The defendant further pleaded that the plaintiffs had not spent the money for the expansion of primary education as was contemplated in their scheme and that assuming that there was a contract the defendant was not bound to carry out his part of the contract as the plaintiffs have committed a breach of it In that sense the previous clause denying that there was any contract would be mere repetition of the denial contained in paragraphs and of the original written statement and the second clause would be a statement which would serve no useful purpose from the point of view of the defendant The language of paragraph a of the amended written statement is perhaps not as artistic as Mr <NAME> would have wished it to be but the paragraph taken as a whole seems to me to be clear as to the meaning to be given to it It is clear from the judgment that the plaintiffs counsel then understood this proposed amendment to mean that assuming there was a contract it was not enforceable in a municipal Court of law But even if there is a contract we say it is not enforceable by the Court In paragraph the defendant sets out certain further breaches of the alleged contract on the part of the plaintiffs and contends that the plaintiffs having committed breaches of the alleged contract are not entitled to any relief in respect of it No application was made to me at the end of <NAME> reply for any oral evidence to be taken on this point It seems to be covered by issue No in the case and as it is an issue of law there would be no hardship in my opinion on the plaintiffs if it were to be allowed to remain The correspondence on which reliance has been placed on behalf of the plaintiffs is annexed to the plaint and has been put in as Exh The letter of the President refers to the previous correspondence which had taken place on the subject between the <ORG> and <ORG> ending with the <ORG> letter to <ORG> dated January He has called attention to the provisions of Section of the City of Bombay Municipal Act by which it is made incumbent on the corporation to make adequate provision by any means or measures which it is lawfully competent to them to use or to take for maintaining aiding and suitably accommodating schools for primary education subject always to the grant of building grants by <ORG> in accordance with the <ORG> Grant in aid Code for the time being in force The Advocate General contends therefore that there was no consideration for the offer made by <ORG> The letter of <ORG> as I read it seems to me to amount to more than a voluntary offer made out of charitable motives as the Advocate General contends The proposal made by the <ORG> to <ORG> at this date was to share to the extent of one third the extra expenses which the <ORG> was proposing to incur under a scheme spread over ten years at the end of which free and compulsory education would become feasible It cannot be said in my opinion as the Advocate General has contended that because there was no personal advantage to the members of <ORG> in making this offer therefore there was no consideration the consideration in my opinion being an advantage to be gained by a section of <ORG> subjects viz In my opinion there is no force in this contention Another contenti advanced by the learned Advocate General is that the letter does not show that the parties were ad idem and therefore there was no agreement It was only after the first three years bills had been paid that a point was raised on their behalf that the amount of contribution by <ORG> should be limited with reference to the original scheme which was presented by the Municipality As I read Clause of this letter it does not seem to me to form part of the offer which was made The suggestion does not seem to me to be in the nature of a counterproposal By this letter <ORG> replied that they were unable to accept the suggestion made on behalf of the <ORG> that the arrangement should be incorporated in Section when amended as proposed as it would be tantamount to a preferential treatment of the Bombay <ORG> as compared with the District Municipalities Apart from certain considerations which arise from the plaintiffs being a statutory corporation governed by the City of Bombay Municipal Act in respect of their contracts and the defendant being a corporation solely governed by the Government of India Act in respect of his contracts it would seem that an agreement was arrived at between the President of <ORG> professing to act on plaintiffs behalf and the Secretary to <ORG> in the Educational Department professing to act on behalf of <ORG> who in their turn seemed to be acting on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council which would have the effect of binding the parties as a concluded contract if those who professed to act respectively on behalf of the parties were vested in law with the power to bind their respective principals by the acts they purported to do on behalf of their respective principals It is pointed out by the Advocate General that the alleged contract contravenes also the provisions of Section and Section of the City of Bombay Municipal Act No such grounds are here pleaded against the defendant but it is argued on general principles that voidable contracts should not be restricted to those contracts only which are set out in the Indian Contract Act but a contract of the nature now before the <ORG> should also be regarded as a voidable contract coming under the definition of that term given in Section i of the Indian Contract Act where it is stated An executed consideration is some act performed or some value given at the time of making the promise and in return for the promise then made as where goods are delivered or services rendered upon credit that is upon a promise to pay for them at a future time or where money is paid in advance for a promise given out of which the defendants had paid Rs The Advocate General relying for this purpose on section of the Indian Contract Act has asked us to hold that there was no contract at all under which the plaintiff Municipality can claim Apart from the fact that this is travelling outside the pleadings of the parties we think there is another reason why we cannot give effect to the contention Notwithstanding section of the Indian Contract Act we see no reason for not adopting the same view of the law here For we think when regard is had to the principle on which <ORG> have proceeded it is clear we do not run contrary to any provision of section of the Contract Act in holding that in this country too as in England where there is an executed consideration a suit will lie even in the absence of a sealed contract The facts of that case lay down that a corporation can sue on a contract which should have been under seal in spite of the omission of that formality where there is executed consideration These are questions which will require consideration when a proper case arises With great respect it seems to me that Mr Justice <NAME> was right sitting in <ORG> as he did to throw doubt on the validity of the observations made by the learned Chief Justice in <NAME> Trimbak Municipality <ORG> in confirming the judgment of <ORG> held that whatever defects of form there might be in relation to the compromise agreement as a transfer of the equity of redemption were cured by the conduct of the parties in continuously acting upon it and that the right to redeem the mortgages was extinguished Their Lordships do not think that there is anything either in the law of India or of England inconsistent with it but upon the contrary that these laws follow the same rule In a suit said Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> founded on such part performance and the part performance referred to was that of a parol contract concerning land the defendant is really charged upon the equities resulting from the acts done in execution of the contract and not within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds upon the contract itself On the contrary it follows them It was stated in <NAME> <NAME> that the equitable doctrine of part performance did not rest upon the view that equity will relieve against a public statute in cases which fall within it but as Lord <NAME> expressed it the Statute of Frauds only contemplates the case of a person being charged upon the contract only it has not in view the case of a person being charged upon the contract coupled with acts done in pursuance of the contract In the latter case the decision rested entirely on the fact that a valid contract had been made and was enforceable by the appellant Mr <NAME> has relied also on the case of <ORG> <NAME> I A Bom where it was held that the contract sued upon having been executed on the part of the corporation and the defendants in that suit having received full consideration they were bound by the contract and the plaintiffs were entitled to sue on the contract although the contract was not executed under seal as required by a statutory provision That case may be distinguished from the present case on the ground that there the consideration given by the corporation was executed and not executory The objection taken on the ground of want of mutuality is in my opinion fatal to the plaintiffs case and should be allowed I will next consider whether apart from the initial defect that the contract relied on has not been properly executed on behalf of the plaintiffs inasmuch as the party who has purported to act on behalf of the Municipality was the President of the Municipality and not the Commissioner as required by the Municipal Act the contract can be said to be properly executed on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council who is sought to be made liable For a contract made on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council to be binding on him it is necessary to show that it conforms to the provisions of the Government of India Act Geo It will be observed that a paramount condition laid down in this section for such a contract is that the contract should be on behalf and in the name of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> He contends that an instrument is nothing more than a writing and as long as the contract with the Secretary of <ORG> is evidenced by a writing it is immaterial whether there is a single writing or numerous writings which have to be read together to ascertain the contract between the parties Mr <NAME> has relied on the case of The Queen <NAME> where <ORG> in construing Section of the Forgery Act Vic In pursuance of Section Sub section of the <ORG> of India Act the Governor General in <ORG> has by resolution directed and authorised certain officers of <ORG> holding such capacity to execute contracts on behalf and in the name of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> The resolution which was in force at the date of the contract relied on is to be found in the Supplement to the Gazette of India for at and is made in the exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the East India Contracts Act Vic The correspondence on which reliance is placed in this case was carried on by the Secretary to <ORG> in <ORG> Bombay According to that Act the term managers is said to include all persons who have the management of any elementary schools whether the legal interest in the school house is or is not vested in them Under Section of the same Act a statutory duty is cast upon the <ORG> to appoint a <ORG> of sixteen members for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions regarding primary education The defendant not having paid his subscription a suit was brought against him by the plaintiff on behalf of himself and all the other Commissioners who had rendered them selves liable to the contractor It was held that the suit would lie as there was a contract for good consideration If there were no contract with the contractor or if no liability had been incurred and nothing substantial had been done on the faith of the defendant promise the promise to pay the subscription would have been without consideration and therefore void There was no condition as in <ORG> case that should the Bombay <ORG> feel any ill effects against which any immunity was guaranteed the they would become entitled to a specific reward From these authorities it would appear that apart from commercial transactions of the Secretary of <ORG> there are only three exceptions in respect of which he could be made liable although the acts may be acts of <ORG> The Advocate General has contended that the present suit will not come under any of these three exceptions and that there was no obligation on <ORG> to expend any part of its revenue on primary education in Bombay Under these circumstances the Court held that the <ORG> undertaking was not enforceable in a Court of law it not being within the competence of the <ORG> to make a contract which would have the effect of limiting its power of executive action in the future The Advocate General has contended that all administrative acts of <ORG> including contracts with its subjects if they do not relate to a commercial transaction would amount to acts of <ORG> over which the municipal Courts can have no jurisdiction No doubt there is no statutory obligation on him to promote primary education in the city of Bombay beyond providing the <ORG> with a grant in aid for the purpose of buildings where primary education is conducted by the <ORG> but the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> is as such interested in the well being of the citizens of Bombay as much as the <ORG> It was the desire of <ORG> in that primary education in Bombay should be substantially increased and in consideration of the Bombay <ORG> agreeing to expend a larger sum of money than it was hitherto doing for that purpose <ORG> undertook to defray one half the excess expenditure The Advocate General has pointed out that neither the plaintiffs nor <ORG> considered at the time that they were entering into a binding contract No suggestion was made on their behalf that the Commissioner of the Municipality and the Director of Public Instruction should meet and execute a formal agreement which would be under the seal of the <ORG> and would conform to the formalities which are necessary for a contract on behalf and in the name of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> in their reply to the suggestion made on behalf of the plaintiffs declined to amend Section of the City of Bombay Municipal Act on the lines which were suggested and stated that in their opinion the administrative undertaking which they had given should be considered sufficient The Advocate General has argued that even if there was a binding contract it has since become impossible of performance and therefore void He calls attention to Section A Clause of the <ORG> of India Amendment Act by which it is competent to <ORG> by rules to transfer from among the provincial subjects to the administration of the Governor acting with ministers appointed under this Act and for the allocation of revenues or moneys for the purpose of such administration In pursuance of a rule made in that behalf by <ORG> Notification dated December appearing in <ORG> of that date at education was made a transferred subject from January From January the <ORG> of Bombay having lost control over revenues which can be expended for educational purposes it is contended that the contract if there was one has become impossible of performance Reference may be made in this connection to the Devolution Rules appearing at of the Bombay Legislative <ORG> Manual and to the <ORG> of India Act Sections A and It would be presumed in such cases that the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> would make all necessary arrangement to see that the successors of the <ORG> who originally foisted liability upon him have taken over the burden from their predecessors There is no evidence before me to show that the Bombay <ORG> have made any effort to include the amount which the Bombay Municipality was claiming as <ORG> contribution towards the expenditure for primary education in their budgets for the years in dispute In my opinion the objection taken on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> on the ground of impossibility of performance is unsustainable The Advocate General has stated that although from the correspondence it might appear that <ORG> have not treated the <ORG> fairly in this matter there is evidence available to <ORG> to show that the <ORG> have behaved unreasonably towards <ORG> in three matters viz It was unfortunate for the plaintiffs that they came to <ORG> without properly considering their legal position in respect of this contract and it was still more unfortunate for them that the written statement which was originally filed on behalf of <ORG> gave no indication that the Secretary of <ORG> was relying on any technical defences which he was entitled to take The result is that the suit is dismissed with costs
