On the said petition the Collector passed orders suspending the Resolutions Aggrieved by <ORG> order appellate preferred the present appeal by special leave It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the scheme of financing the project was not as a matter of policy open and permissible to a Governmental authority that the <ORG> authority could have put up the construc tion itself departmentally or awarded the execution of the whole project to a building contractor that the method of financing and the execution of the project are beyond the powers of the <ORG> authority under the Act that the terms of the agreement with the developer that the latter be at liberty to dispose of the occupancy rights in the commer cial complex in such manner and on such terms as it may choose would amount to an impermissible delegation of the statutory functions of <ORG> under Section of the Maharashtra <ORG>ities Act that the project in effect amounted to disposal of <ORG> property by way of a long term lease with rights of sub letting in favour of the developer and hence violative of Section of the Act and that the scheme was arbitrary unreasonable and viola tive of Article of the Constitution On behalf of the Respondent it was contended that the increasing revenue expenditure and other financial commit ments rendered it impossible for <ORG> to set apart the financial inputs required for the project that in the management of the transaction regarding disposal of occupancy rights and prompt mobilisation of funds the deficiencies and limitations of the bureaucratic machinery should not be ignored in assessing the value and utility of the alternatives that all the said Resolutions in regard to the Project were passed unanimously which lend credance to the propriety and wisdom of the measure and its reasonable ness that the estimates and calculations on which the scheme was worked out by <ORG> would show that the developer had no opportunity of making any run away profits or exploitative gains The question is not whether it is un conventional by the standard of the extant practices but whether there was something in the law rendering it impermissible No doubt there is a degree of public accountability in all governmental enterprises the field of trade and commerce and of the range of economic and commercial enterprises of government and its instrumentali ties there is an increasing dimension to governmental con cern for stimulating efficiency keeping costs down im proved management methods prevention of time and cost over runs in projects balancing of costs against time scales quality control cost benefit ratios There are essentially matters of economic policy with lack adjudicative disposition unless they violate constitutional or legal limits on power or have demonstrable pejorative environmental implications or if they amount to clear abuse of power The project is not ultra vires of the powers of <ORG> and hence there is no justification for quashing the Resolution of <ORG> In the instant case it is possible to fit the power exercised by the Municipal authority into Section of the Maharashtra Municipalities Act and hence there is no reason why the provision be interpreted unduly restrictively to exclude such enterprise A Some phrases which pass from one branch of law to another as did the expression void and voidable from private law areas to public law situations carry over with them meanings that may be inapposite in the changed context Some such thing has happened to the words Reasonable Reasonableness etc While it is true that principles of judicial review apply to the exercise by a government body of its contractu al powers the inherent limitations on the scope of the inquiry are themselves a part of those principles There is no merit in the contention that the Project Scheme was tailored to suit Respondent No alone or that the project as put to tender did not admit of tenders on fixed comparable parameters The tenders were such that the tenderer could identify the terms which form the basis of comparative evaluation
