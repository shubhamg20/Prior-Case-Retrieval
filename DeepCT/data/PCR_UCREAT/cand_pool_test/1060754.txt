HEADNOTE accused were tried for offences under section and read with Section of I for the murder of two persons named <NAME> and <NAME> and injuries to others named <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The trial court relying on the evidence of Ws and who were the main eye witnesses convicted all the accused under section I read with Section I and awarded them life imprisonment Consequently the matter was referred to a third judge A The maxim that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt is a rule of caution laid down by <ORG> in respect of assessing the evidence in criminal cases Section places burden of proof on the accused in the first part and in the second part there is a presumption which the <ORG> can draw regarding the absence of the cir cumstances which presumption is always rebuttable But where the accused introduces material to displace the presumption which may affect the prosecution case or create a reasonable doubt about the existence of one or other ingredients of the offence and then it would amount to a case where prosecution failed to prove its own case beyond reasonable doubt More so when there are circumstances on the record gathered from the prosecution evidence chief and cross examinations probabilities and circumstances if any introduced by the accused either by adducing evidence or otherwise creating a reasonable doubt about the existence of the ingredients of the offence A The presumption regarding the absence of existence of circumstances regarding the exception can be rebutted by the accused by intro ducing evidence In that way the benefit of a reasonable doubt which arises from the legal and factual considerations even under Section of the Evidence Act should necessarily go to the accused A The Evidence Act while adopting the requirement of the prudent man as an appropriate concrete standard by which to measure proof at the same time contemplates of giving full effect to be given to circumstances or condition of proba bility or improbability Even in respect of the cases covered by Section the prosecution is not absolved of its duty of discharging the burden The matter came up before a third Judge <NAME> He took the view that only such of those accused to whom specific overt acts were attributed could be convicted and the other should be given benefit of doubt It is contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the occur rence has taken place in broad day light and merely because the witnesses are interested their evidence cannot be re jected and that the view taken by Justice <NAME> is incorrect and the view taken by the trial court as well as by Justice <NAME> has to be accepted On the other hand the counsel appearing for the accused submitted that witnesses who were partisans and were highly interested have made omnibus allegations and it is highly dangerous to accept their evidence because there is every likelihood of innocent persons having been falsely implicated It is also their further submission that the prosecution has not come forward with the whole truth and that the origin of the occurrence has been suppressed in as much as injuries to some of the accused persons have not been explained and consequently it must be held that occurrence did not take place in the manner alleged by the prosecution and that under these circumstances the truth from falsehood cannot be separated and therefore none of the accused could be convicted another Doctor who conducted postmortem on deceased No <NAME> found two gun shots wounds on the cranial cavity He also admitted that he examined accused No and he found five tiny abrasions in the area of cm cm on outer surface of right thigh just above knee joint and the injured was refer red to the radiologist Before the trial court as well as before <ORG> firstly it was contended on behalf of the accused that the eye witnesses are highly interested and therefore their evidence cannot be accepted and even otherwise they have not come out with the whole truth and the injuries found on two of the accused would go to show that the accused So far as the plea of self defence is concerned the trial court held that the plea taken by accused No was to be rejected mainly on the ground that there was no material to show that at the pond the fishing operations were going on Regarding the presence of the alleged gun shots injuries on accused No he pointed out that the medical evidence is inconclusive on the point whether those injuries were caused at the time when this incident took place In the appeal before <ORG> Justice <NAME> took the view that the theory that the injuries on accused Nos and were self inflicted cannot be accepted and that the plea taken by accused No appears to be probable in view of the fact that the bullet found in the dead body of deceased No was fired by a Bore gun and that as admitted by the Investigating Officer it was accused No only in that area who had a licence for Bore gun which was deposited by him in the police station after the occurrence Coming to the injuries found on accused Nos and Justice <NAME> took the view that they received injuries during the course of the same occurrence and that the three eye witnesses have not fur nished any explanation regarding those injuries and that these witnesses have falsely implicated some of the accused due to enmity and therefore their evidence cannot be relied upon and accordingly ordered total acquittal The learned Judge took this view because he was doubtful that those pallets could have entered the body through the external injuries which are described as tiny abrasions Therefore there is no basis whatsoever to presume that the pallets under the flesh must have been there al ready even before this occurrence took place As a matter of fact accused No <NAME> was referred to the Doctor since there was an injury having examined him found that there were radio opaque round shadows underneath the injury and it was only for that reason he referred the injured to the radiologist and the radiologist after taking the ray concluded that under neath the injury pallets discharged from a fire arm were embedded in the flesh It is suggested by the prosecution that this could have been a self inflicted one but again there is no basis for such presumption Now the question is whether the prosecution has ex plained these injuries and if there is no such explanation what would be its effect We are not prepared to agree with the learned counsel for the defence that in each and every case where prosecution fails to explain the injuries found on some of the accused the prosecution case should automat ically be rejected without any further probe He placed considerable reliance on some of the judgments of this Court In our judgment the failure of the prosecu tion to offer any explanation in that regard shows that evidence of the prosecution witnesses relating to the inci dent is not true or at any rate not wholly true Further those injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants It was further observed that In a murder case the non explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of the occur rence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance from which the court can draw the following inferences that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and the origin of the occurrence and has thus not presented the true version that the witnesses who have denied the presence of the injuries on the person of the accused are lying on a most material point and therefore their evidence is unreliable that in case there is a defence version which explains the injuries on the person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution one Relying on these two cases the learned counsel for the defence contended that in the instant case the prosecution has failed to explain the injuries on the two accused and the genesis and the origin of the occurrence have been suppressed and a true version has not been presented before the Court and consequently the truth from falsehood cannot be separated and consequently the entire prosecution case must be rejected In <NAME> case it is made clear that failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation regarding the injuries found on the accused may show that the evidence related to the incident is not true or at any rate not wholly true But such a non explanation may assume greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution But where the evidence is clear cogent and creditworthy and where the Court can distinguish the truth from falsehood the mere fact that the injuries are not explained by the prosecution cannot by itself be a sole basis to reject such evidence and consequently the whole case Much depends on the facts and circumstances of each case From this alone it cannot be said that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and the origin of the occurrence and has not presented a true ver sion As discussed above we are satisfied in this case that nonexplanation of injuries on these two accused persons does not affect the prosecution case as a whole but in a case of this nature what all that the defence can contend on the basis of non explanation of injuries found on these two accused is that the accused could have had a right of pri vate defence or at any rate a reasonable doubt arises in this regard It is also their submission that a careful exami nation of the provisions of Sections and I would show that on a reasonable apprehension of grievous hurt or death the accused had a right even to the extent of causing the death of the assailants and they cannot be expected to modulate this right in such a situation and that in the instant case these four appellants were justified even to the extent of causing death of the two deceased by inflicting gun shot wounds We shall now consider the submission whether the accused had the right of self defence Under these circumstances the important question that we have to consider is whether the accused should be denied the benefit of an exception on the ground that the accused have not discharged the necessary burden of establishing their right to the benefit of the exception beyond all reasonable doubt just like the prosecution is bound under Section of the Evidence Act or if upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole and the surrounding facts and circum stances of the case a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the court about the existence of such a right wheth er the accused in such a situation is entitled to the benefit of the said exception i the right of private defence Section of the Evidence Act is in the following terms When a person is accused of any offence the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Indian Penal Code or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code or in any law defining the offence is upon him and the <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances The burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the exceptions mentioned therein is upon him The words the burden of proving the existence of circumstances occuring in the Section are very signifi cant That being so the question is what is the nature of burden that lies on the accused under Section if benefit of the general exception of private defence is claimed and how it can be discharged In <NAME> <ORG> Appeal Cases Viscount <NAME> observed When evidence of death and malice has been given this is a question for the jury the prisoner is entitled to show by evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the <ORG> that the act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked It is further observed Just as there is evidence on behalf of the prosecution so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause a doubt as to his guilt But while the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner there is no such burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence and it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt he is not bound to satisfy the jury of his innocence Through out the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any stationary exception If at the end of and on the whole of the case there is reasonable doubt created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner as to wheth er the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious inten tion the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal No matter what the charge or where the trial the principle that the prosecu tion must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained We have noticed that Section requires that when a person is accused of any offence the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions or special exception or proviso contained in any pan of the Penal Code is on him and the <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances The majority agreed with the view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case In <NAME> case <NAME> <NAME> in his concurring judgment observed that Section is stated in two forms that of a rule as to the burden of proof and that of a presumption and that the burden of proving the guilt of the accused always rests on the prose cution and never shifts and the learned Judge further held that the doubt cast in connection with the right of private defence must be a reasonable doubt and if there is such a reasonable doubt it casts a doubt on the entire case of the prosecution and that the result is that the accused gets a benefit of doubt SCR it is observed that In India as it is in England there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused as a general rule and it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused But when an accused relies upon the General Excep tions in the Indian Penal Code or on any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the Penal Code or in any law defining an offence Section of the Evidence Act raises a presumption against the accused and also throws a burden on him to rebut the said presump tion Indeed there is no conflict at all The prosecution therefore in a case of homicide shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused death with the requisite intention described in Section of the Penal Code But under Section of the Evidence Act the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the exception lies on the accused and the <ORG> shah presume the absence of such circumstances If the material placed before the <ORG> such as oral and documentary evidence presumptions admissions or even the prosecution evidence satisfied the test of prudent man the accused will have discharged his burden It may for instance raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Judge whether the accused had the requisite intention laid down in Section of the Penal Code A majority of seven Judges approved the principle laid down in <NAME> case After analysing the view expressed by <ORG> in the several above mentioned decisions <NAME> observed After a close scrutiny of every part of each of the seven opinions in <NAME> case All LJ AIR All FB I have come to the conclusion that the majority of their Lordships did not lay down anything beyond three important propositions which if not either directly or indirectly supported by decisions of their Lordships of <ORG> have not been affected in the slightest degree by these decisions is necessarily lifted at least when there is enough evidence on record to justify giving the benefit of doubt to the accused on the question whether he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged and thirdly if the doubt though raised due to evidence in support of the exception pleaded is reasonable and affects an ingredient of the offence with which the accused is charged the accused would be entitled to an acquittal I find it based on these three propositions which provide the ratio decidendi and this is all that needs be clarified The <ORG> decisions have considered the last two stages so far but the first stage has not yet been dealt with directly or separately there in any case brought to our notice The majority speaking through <NAME> <NAME> laid down that the dictum in <NAME> case which is still a good law can however be modified as follows In a case in which any General Exception in the Indian Penal Code or any special exception or proviso contained in another part of the same Code or in any law defining the offence is pleaded or raised by an accused persons and the evidence led in support of such plea judged by the test of the preponderance of probability as in a civil proceeding fails to displace the presumption arising from Section of the Evidence Act in other words to disprove the absence of circumstances bringing the case within the said excep tion but upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole including the evidence given in support of the plea based on the said exception or proviso a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court as regards one or more the ingre dients of the offence the accused person shall be entitled to the benefit of the reasonable doubt as to his guilt and hence to acquittal of the said offence This very question has been answered by <ORG> in <NAME> case and it has been held that the general burden of proving the ingredients of the offence is always on the prosecution but the burden of proving the circumstances attracting the exception lies on the accused Therefore there is no such infirmity in the view taken in these cases about the scope and effect of Sections and of the Evidence Act We have not come across any case of <ORG> where the ratio laid down in <NAME> case and which was subsequently approved by a larger Bench in <NAME> case has been considered comprehensively while considering the right of private defence put forward by the accused to some extent went into the question of burden of proof under Section and a reference is made to a decision of the larger Bench in <NAME> case As stated is that judgment while the initial presump tion regarding the absence of circumstances bringing the case within an exception may be met by showing the existence of appropriate facts the burden to establish a plea of private defence by a balance of probabilities is a more difficult burden to discharge We may also refer to a judgment of a Bench of three Judges consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> It is wellsettled that the burden on the accused is not as onerous as that which lies on the prosecution While the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt the accused can discharge his onus by establishing a mere pre ponderance of probability <NAME> <NAME> referred to the judgments of <ORG> in <NAME> case Nana vati case and the larger Bench decision in <NAME> case and applying the principles of benefit of doubt laid in the above three cases to the facts of the case before them observed Applying the principle of benefit of doubt as I had exp lained above to the plea of private defence of person in the instant case I think that even if the appellant did not fully establish his plea yet there is sufficient evidence both direct and circumstantial to justify the finding that the prosecution has not established its case beyond reasonable doubt against Partap on an essential ingredient of the offence of murder the required mensrea There fore the contrary view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case and in <ORG> <NAME> AIR Sau The first part of Section as noted above lays down that when a person is accused of an offence the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the exceptions or proviso is on him and the latter part of it lays down that the <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances In a given case the accused may discharge the burden by expressly proving the existence of such circumstances thereby he is able to disprove the absence of circumstances also But where he is unable to discharge the burden by expressly proving the existence of such circumstances or he is unable to disprove the absence of such circumstances then the case would fall in the category of not proved and the <ORG> may presume the absence of such circumstances In this background we have to examine the meaning of the words the <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances bearing in mind the general principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prose cution has to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and the benefit of every reasonable doubt should go to the accused The accused is entitled to be acquitted if at the end of and on the whole of the case there is a reasonable doubt created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be enter tained Once there is any evidence to support such explanations the onus of disproving them rests upon the prosecution The accused either by cross examination of the prosecution witnesses or by evidence called on his behalf or by a combination of the two must place before the court such material as makes the defence a live issue fit and proper to be left to the jury Dealing with the presumptions the author says The proper direction as to onus of proof where prima facie evidence has been given on the part of the prosecution which if unanswered would raise a presumption upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict of guilty and the defendant has called evidence to rebut that presump tion is that if they accepted the explanation given by and on behalf of the prisoner or if that explanation raised in their minds a reasonable doubt as to his guilt they should acquit him as the onus of proof that he was guilty still lay upon the prosecution It is held in <NAME> case that under Section of the act the <ORG> shall presume the absence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the exceptions i the <ORG> shall regard the non existence of such circumstances as proved till they are disproved but this presumption can be rebutted by the accused by introducing evidence to sup port his plea of accident in the circumstances mentioned therein This presumption may also be rebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited from the evidence led by the prosecution or by the combined effect of such circumstances and the evidence adduced by the accused In this view it might be said that the general burden to prove the ingredients of the offence unless there is a specific statute to the contrary is always on the prosecution but the burden to prove the circumstances coming under the exceptions lies upon the accused It may for instance raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the judge whether the accused had the requisite intention laid down in of the Penal Code The maxim that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt is a rule of caution laid down by <ORG> in respect of assessing the evidence But where the accused introduces material to dis place the presumption which may affect the prosecution case or create a reasonable doubt about the existence of one or other ingredients of the offence and then it would amount to a case where prosecution failed to prove its own case beyond reasonable doubt More so when there are circumstances on the record gathered from the prosecution evidence chief and cross examinations pro babilities and circumstances if any introduced by the accused either by adducing evidence or otherwise creating a reasonable doubt about the existence of the ingredients of the offence If there are absolutely no circumstances at all in favour of the exist ence of such an exception then the rest of the enquiry does not arise inspite of a mere plea being raised From what has been discussed above it emerges that the presumption regarding the absence of existence of circum stances regarding the exception can be rebutted by the accused by introducing evidence in any one of the manners mentioned above In that way the benefit of a reasonable doubt which arises from the legal and factual considerations even under Section of the Evidence Act should necessarily go to the accused The Act while adopting the require ment of the prudent man as an appropriate concrete standard by which to measure proof at the same time contemplates of giving full effect to be given to circumstances or condition of probability or improbability There is a difference between a flimsy or fantastic plea which is to be rejected altogether If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence of course it is possible but not in the least probable the case is proved beyond rea sonable doubt As already noted in <NAME> case Mathur speaking for the majori ty while affirming the view taken in <NAME> case ob served that in a case where any such exception is pleaded and the evidence led in support of such plea judged by the test of preponderance of probability fails to displace the presumption arising from Section of the Evidence Act yet if upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole including the evidence led in support of plea of exception or proviso a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence the accused shall be entitled to the benefit of the reasonable doubt as to his guilt justify his plea but the degree and character of proof which the accused is expected to support his plea cannot be equated with the degree and character of proof expected from the prosecution which is required to prove its case It can thus be seen that there is a dividing line between a case of the accused discharging the burden by preponderance of probabilities which is equated to proof of the exception and a state of reasonable doubt that arises on a considera tion of the evidence and facts and circumstances as a whole as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence its burden and where the accused pleads exception and if there is some evidence to support that plea the obligatory presumption under Section is lifted and the accused may proceed further and establish his plea by a preponderance of probabilities or he may carry his plea further and suc ceed in creating a reasonable doubt about an ingredient of an offence Likewise in the case where the statute throws special burden on the accused to disprove the existence of the ingredients of the offence he has to discharge the burden for example in the cases arising under Prevention of Food Adulteration Act if the accused pleads a defence under Section the burden is on him to establish the same since the warranty on which he relies is a circumstance within his knowledge Even in respect of the cases covered by Section the prosecution is not absolved of its duty of discharging the burden The accused can also discharge the burden under Sec Learned counsel submits that the accused is not expected to modulate his right of self defence and that in the instant case it cannot with certainty be said that they have exceeded this right and therefore they are entitled to an acquittal It is also observed that the question whether a person having a right of private defence has used more force than is necessary would depend on the facts and circumstances of a particular case We accordingly set aside the conviction of the
