Custodian first stated that the property was not evacuee property and the respondent acted on it later acquired it as evacuee property whether Custodian bound by the earlier statement Later however the appellant passed an order declaring the property to be evacuee property Since the Custodian did not issue a sale certificate in his favour respondent no I filed a writ petition in <ORG> which was dismissed by a single Judge on the ground that the seller was an evacuee There was no doubt that she was resident in Pakistan after the partition of India and was therefore unable to occupy supervise or manage her property in the United Provinces The fact that the first respondent had made an inquiry from the Assistant Custodian whether the property was evacuee property and was told that it was not did not make any difference to this question It appears that Mrs <NAME> did not come to India at all till when she sold this property to the sons of respondent No and one Mrs <NAME> But on the st appellant passed an order declaring the property as an evacuee property The st respondent application to the st appellant to issue a sale certificate in his favour not having produced my result he filed a writ petition out of which this appeal arises The learned Single Judge took the view that Mrs <NAME> was an evacuee because she had left Uttar Pradesh after the st day of March to a place outside the territories of India It was urged before the Bench that she would be an evacuee under section ii of the Ordinance but the Bench refused to consider that question There is no doubt that she was resident in Pakistan after the partition of India and she was therefore We do not think that the learned Judges of <ORG> who heard the appeal were right in refusing to consider this aspect of the matter He also referred to the fact that she had sent the money from Teheran in and the possession of the property had been taken by her son who came to India in for that purpose specifically whereas Mrs <NAME> continued to reside in Pakistan till she came to India in for selling the plot and that she was a Pakistani national In the revision peti tion filed before the Assistant Custodian General by the st respondent also it is admitted that Mrs <NAME> migrated to Pakistan from Teheran as was held by the Assistant Custodian The result of such repeal and reenactment was that the property in question which had vested in the <NAME> continued to vest in him notwithstanding the repeal of the Ordinance and there was no need to take any action under section of that Act We do not consider that the fact that the st respondent had made an enquiry from the Assistant <NAME> whether the property in question was an evacuee property and was told that it was not makes any difference to this question We do not think that the reliance placed on behalf of the respondents on the decision in <NAME> Minister of Pensions where Lord <NAME> observed I come therefore to the most difficult question in the case They assumed authority over the matter and ass ured the appellant that his disability had been accepted as attributable to military service He was entitled to assume that they had consulted any other departments that might be concerned such as <ORG> before they gave him the assurance The department itself is clearly bound and as it is but an agent for the <ORG> It binds the <ORG> also and as the <ORG> is bound so are the other departments for they also are but agents of the <ORG> The <ORG> letter therefore binds the <ORG> and through the <ORG> it binds <NAME> The function of the Minister of Pension is to administer the royal warrant issued by the <ORG> and be must so administer it as to honour all assurances given by or on behalf of the <ORG> That decision has been disapproved by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Lord <NAME> referred to the observation of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Minister of Pensions and observed My Lords I know of no such principle in our law nor was any authority for it cited The illegality of an act is the same whether or not the actor has been misled by an assumption of authority on the part of a government officer however high or low in the hierarchy The question is whether the character of an act done in face of a statutory prohibition is affected by the fact that it has been induced by a misleading assumption of authority But it is certain that neither a minister nor any subordinate officer of the <ORG> can by any conduct or represen tation bar the <ORG> from enforcing a statutory prohibition or entitle the subject to maintain that there has been no breach of it But there is one further question to be decided
