Her prayer to the Sub Collector appears to have been that one <NAME> a relation of hers should be appointed deputy By an order dated the District Collector set aside the appointment of <NAME> on the ground that it was undesirable to appoint a Muslim as deputy of a Hindu minor As <NAME> had intimated that she was willing to nominate <NAME> the District Collector directed the Sub Collector to examine the qualifications of the nominee and to appoint him if he was found suitable <ORG> appeared by counsel before the Board and raised the objection that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Collector <ORG> has therefore come to this court with this petition to quash the order of the <ORG> on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the District Collector That petition came on in the first instance before one of us namely <NAME> He observed The question therefore is whether <ORG> have or have not the power of revision which they have purported to exercise in their order now impugned dated The proper course it appears to me to follow is to place the papers before my Lord the Chief Justice for directions either to refer the case to a <ORG> or to a Full <ORG> for resolving the conflict between these two <ORG> decisions and there will be a direction accordingly The question we have to decide is whether <ORG> has power to interfere with an order made by the District Collector under Section of Madras Act of the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act appointing a deputy to a post registered in the name of a minor To answer this question it is necessary pt the outset to examine the statutes that have a bearing on the powers of the <ORG> and the Collector Section runs The <ORG> of Revenue have had and are here by declared to have authority to superintend and control all persons employed in the executive administration of the public revenue as far as the said superintendence and control may relate to the executive administration of the revenue under the regulations now enacted or to be hereafter enacted It will be noticed that the section though it confers on the <ORG> power and authority to superintend and control all persons employed in the executive administration of the public revenues imposes one important qualification thereon and it is this the power of superintendence and control is limited to the executive administration of the re venue In other words under the guise of superintendence and control of persons employed in the executive administration of the revenue the <ORG> cannot give instructions to them in respect of other matters as for instance the spread of literacy Section of the Regulation explicitly places on <ORG> the responsibility of seeing that the executive officers employed under it discharge their duties diligently The section runs <ORG> shall be responsible that the executive officers employed under them discharge the duties of their respective stations with assiduity and shall require them to pay a ready and implicit obedience to all orders and regulations and shall punish neglect in the subordinate officers of revenue at their discretion according to the powers vested in them for that purpose Section enacts Collectors have had and are hereby declared to have authority to superintend and control under the orders of <ORG> all persons employed in the executive administration of the public revenue as far as the said superintendence and control may relate to the executive administration of the revenue under the regulations now enacted or to be hereafter enacted Paragraph of Section states A subordinate or Assistant Collector in charge of a particular division of a district shall ex officio have authority to exercise within the division under his charge all the powers granted to Collectors by the Regulation now in force or that may be hereafter enacted unless the contrary shall be expressly declared in any Regulation We would emphasise the last words of the section unless the contrary shall be expressly declared in any Regulation which mean that in the absence of express provision to the contrary all the powers conferred by any statute on a Collector may be exercised within the limits of his territorial jurisdiction by a Sub Collector or Assistant Collector in charge of a division acting under the preceding clauses shall be subject in all cases and in the fullest manner to the superintendence control and revision of the Collector who shall have power either to direct generally that the proceedings of any of his subordinates or Assistants shall be regularly submitted to himself before the decision order or sentence is earned into execution and to confirm modify or annul them or issue any further orders in the cases as he may see fit or in any particular case to direct that the decision order or sentence of any of his subordinates or Assistants shall not be carried into execution and to pass such further orders as he may see fit It will be appreciated that the scheme of these Regulations is this the duty and the responsibility for the executive administration of the revenue is placed squarely on the Board and it is given the power to discharge that responsibility by punishing those who neglect their duties In like manner so far as his district is concerned the responsibility is placed on the Collector but in order to enable him to discharge his duties he is given a plenary power of control and superintendence over his subordinate and assistant Collectors He has been given power to require Sub Collectors and Assistant Collectors to submit to him their proceedings before they are given effect to and he is given power to confirm modify or annul their decisions Para of Section provides When a vacancy occurs in any of the village officers forming class in Section the Collector shall fill up the vacancy in accordance with the provisions of the following sub sections Under Section an appeal lies to the District Collector from every decision given by the Collector under Section and to <ORG> if the decree was made by the District Collector But what has to be noticed arid that is the point we desire to emphasise here is that no appeal is provided for from an order made under Section Village Officers in the State fall into two broad categories those in respect of whom there is specific statutory provision and those for whom there is no such provision In the case of certain specified village offices in ryotwari areas claims to them by way of hereditary right are recognised by statute which confers some special rights on the claimants to and incumbents of such offices A village officer to whom Act of or Act of applies cannot be punished except in the manner provided for by the Acts and when he Is punished he has got a right of appeal as provided in the Acts He preferred a second appeal to <ORG> the result of which was that the <ORG> on restored the order of the Revenue Divisional Officer dismissing him <NAME> observed It is quite clear I think that no second appeal lay in this case The learned Government Pleader however contends that the order was passed in the exercise of powers of revision possessed by the <ORG> But it is argued that as the <ORG> is constituted the superior appellate authority it follows that it has a general power of revision Reliance is placed on a sentence quoted from the ruling in In re Palanikumara Chinnayya Goundan AIR Mad which states the well known proposition that appellate jurisdiction includes the power to interfere in revision But in order that that proposition may apply a revisional power must have been conferred by the statute on the tribunal I am not referred to any authority which lays down that where a statute confers a right of appeal and is silent about a right of revision it has conferred a right of revision apparently unlimited in extent and absolute in authority so that for example as in this case the mere con ferment of a right of appeal on the <ORG> ipso facto confers on it a right to enhance the sentence of a lower tribunal without notice to the party affected Such a contention is tantamount to saying that where a statute provides a right of appeal and also provides a power of revision the latter provision is not an enabling provision but is a restricting provision limiting the unlimited powers of revision otherwise possessed by the <ORG> There was an appeal from the decision of <ORG> which was dismissed <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Bench observed It is however contended by the learned Government Pleader that the <ORG> was in fact acting in the exercise of its revisional powers though it did not in any way indicate that it was so doing and that it got such powers from Section of Regulation of which section has never been abolished The plaintiff then filed a suit for a declaration that he was the legal holder of the office of headman and the appointment of defendant made by the <ORG> was illegal At <NAME> formulated the question for determination in these terms The only question therefore is whether the order of <ORG> on this so called second appeal by defendant is a legal order which would have the effect of putting the plaintiff in the position of one seeking to establish his right to succeed to an office or is it an unlawful attempt to invade the established rights which the plaintiff has already acquired At the learned Judge stated The only power which can be claimed by <ORG> is based on Section <ORG> of Revenue Regulation whereby the <ORG> is given authority to superintend and control all persons employed in the executive administration of the public revenue I do not wish to say anything which might be taken as indicating that in no circumstances can <ORG> by virtue of its powers under Section <ORG> of Revenue Regulation set aside a statutory order of its subordinate in the case of a gross error attended by serious consequences for which no other remedy is provided by law But I am emphatically of opinion that these general powers of superintendence did not authorise <ORG> to arrogate to itself a power of interference in revision or in second appeal from a statutory order when machinery of the statute itself confers no such power and contemplates the utilisation of another remedy which is accessible to the person aggrieved more specially in a case in which the consequences of any error are purely personal to the rival claimants We next have the case in A That Case was heard by the learned Chief Justice and <NAME> and in the course of his judgment the learned Chief Justice observed We have no hesitation in holding that the Government had no power whatever to pass any order in this matter There is no provision in that Act Act of conferring any power on the Government to interfere with the orders of any of the Subordinate revenue authorities entrusted with specified powers by the provisions of that Act We do not desire to say anything about the powers of the Government to interfere with the orders of <ORG> generally because we are convinced that <ORG> itself had no power to interfere with the order passed by the District Collector in a case like the present In this case the order of the Revenue Divisional Officer removing the petitioner and appointing another as the person to discharge the duties of the office during the minority of the registered heir was liable to be revised by the District Collector It a statute confers a particular right and prescribes a particular mode for its enforcement the enforcement of the right must be sought in that mode Conversely it no appeal or revision is provided for then the order of the original authority cannot be interfered with and that order would be the his and final order The question maybe asked has the District Collector power to interfere with an order passed by the Divisional Officer i the Collector under Section There was a vacancy in the office of village munsif The Collector himself was under an erroneous impression that there was a right of appeal and he reversed the order of the Revenue Divisional Officer and appointed defendant I in his place The Court observed Paragraph of Section of Regulation VII of expressly states that it applies to all the powers granted to Collectors by the Regulation now in force or that may hereafter be enacted It is only by virtue of this Regulation that a Revenue Divisional Officer gets authority to exercises the powers of Collector under Act of Consequently the District Collector power of Revision created by the same Regulation unless it is expressly taken away must be held to continue They therefore held that the Collector had power to interfere Ultimately the Collector made an order on cancelling the order registering exhausted all his remedies by way of appeal and otherwise and eventually on filed a suit for a declaration that the orders of the District Collector were illegal and ultra vires <NAME> held that the Collector had no jurisdiction to make the order cancelling the registration of under Section of the Act The Collector under this clause may direct generally that the proceedings of any of his subordinates or Assistants shall be regularly submitted to himself before the decision order or sentence is carried into execution and if so submitted he is empowered to confirm modify or annul those proceedings or even may issue any further orders in the case as he may think fit Instead of making a general direction he may require that in a particular case the decision order or sentence of any of his subordinates or Assistants shall not be carried into execution and ha may pass such further orders as he may think fit In either case it should be noticed that the power is conferred to interfere with the order in the manner provided by the section only before the order is carried into execution The Collector is given power not merely to correct a mistake which a Sub Collector or an Assistant Collector may have made but to step in before he makes a mistake Would it be right to say that because those orders of the Sub Collector have been given effect to that is to say the distraints have been made immoveable properties have been attached and persons arrested the District Collector has no power to interfere even if he considered the Sub Collector orders to be unduly harsh and oppressive at the outset that that case fell outside the scope of Act of and the rules framed thereunder and on that ground it is clearly distinguishable from A <NAME> was appointed to act as the village munsif of Madakkal when that post fell vacant on the resignation of the permanent village munsif The office was not governed by the provisions of Madras Act of Subsequent to his appointment there were complaints against Veerabadra and the Sub Collector of Hosur terminated his appointment Against that appointment of <NAME> Veerabadra preferred an appeal to the Collector who dismissed the appeal They rejected the contention that <NAME> could not invoke the writ jurisdiction of this court because he had submitted to the adjudication of the dispute between himself and Veerabadra by the tribunal that is <ORG> the jurisdiction of which he challenged in this court If the petitioner had moved the <ORG> of Revenue for an order in his favour and after having failed in such proceedings had come up to this court challenging the <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain his application then the matter would have been different had the <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain revision petitions from the orders passed by the authorities immediately subordinate to it which question the learned Judges answered In our opinion there can be no doubt that the <ORG> possessed such a power The learned Judges referred to Section of Madras Regulation of and also to Section of Madras Regulation of and observed Therefore it is open to <ORG> to provide the rules and act in the nature of a supervisory authority over subordinate revenue collectors We respectfully agree with that observation An appeal will be allowed to <ORG> against an order passed by the Collector on appeal by a holder of non hereditary village office of karnam or headman enhancing the punishment imposed by the original order to removal or dismissal and a second appeal against an order passed by the Collector on appeal confirming the punishment of removal or dismissal imposed by the original order and of the Standing Order lay down is that in particular cases an aggrieved party will have a right of appeal and second appeal What however we have to say is that the power to frame a rule or to amend it should not cloud the real issue With all respect to the learned Judges who decided <NAME> case we have to observe that they appear to have been under a misapprehension as regards the true scope and legal effect of the standing orders of the <ORG> They stated After all the standing orders of the <ORG> of Revenue are merely collections of resolutions made by the <ORG> for its own conduct of business as well as for regulating the procedure in the matter of collection of revenue by subordinate revenue tribunals and executive functionaries They observed further As we have already remarked standing orders of the <ORG> are merely executive instructions by the <ORG> to its subordinate officers whereby they lay down the procedure to be adopted in certain cases Thus for instance Section of Madras Act of confers on the <ORG> power to make rules on various matters with the approval of the <ORG> after previous publication There are several other statutory provisions incorporated in the <ORG> Standing Orders In the course of their judgment the learned Judges observed The fact that there is no executive order enabling a party to come by way of revision would not take away from the <ORG> the statutory right conferred upon it under Section of Madras Regulation of In other words the <ORG> cannot ignore the existing rule by treating the order made in that particular case as an amendment of the rule The <ORG> possesses both the powers to frame rules and the power to pass orders in individual cases But when a case comes up for which provision already exists under the rules in force that case must be disposed of in accordance with the rules Thus while the <ORG> has undoubted power to superintend and a power to frame rules and amend them from time to time in exercise of that power of superintendence the <ORG> is bound by those very rules when it acts as quasi judicial tribunal and adjudicates on rights of parties founded on those rules The distinction is real and that if we may say so with respect appears to have been lost sight of by the learned Judges who decided <NAME> case Before parting with this rule we might refer to the judgments in No of Mad and of Mad rendered by one of us on which appear to sustain the powers of the <ORG> to interfere with appointments to a non hereditary office of village munsif Under certain wartime Regulations and enactments the Minister of Health in Great Britain enacted a considerable measure of delegated legislation under which power was given to local authorities to requisition premises But it was contended for the local authority that subsequent to the original attempt at requisition of the house the Minister had either himself requisitioned the house or ratified the act of the local authority The point of the case is this that the possession of what may be called legislative authority does not necessarily carry with it the power to interfere in particular cases if the rules on that topic issued in the exercise of legislative authority do not provide for such interference That the rule making power cannot be invoked to give a particular decision in a particular case will be apparent from one example After having issued a rule on the point fixing the liability on let us say the last purchaser the <ORG> cannot assuming for our purpose that the <ORG> have been given the power by the Act to frame rules give final decisions in individual cases of assessment that the liability shall not be on the last purchaser but on his vendor should in our opinion govern also the rules framed by <ORG> with reference to non hereditary officers though appointments and punishments of those officers are not governed by any statute The Act does not provide for a subsidiary class of hereditary officers other than those for whom the Act is intended consisting of their substitutes and their heirs A person appointed under Section is a person appointed only to do the duties of the office and when the section says that the Collector may direct that until the death or return to duty of such last holder the duties of the holder shall be performed by some person it only prescribes the period of time during which that provision has to be made but does not mean that the person who is appointed is to hold for that period And finally The act does not govern the case and the respondent has no grievance In relation to persons possessing or claiming to possess antecedent rights the power exercised by the Revenue Divisional Officer and the authorities superior to the Revenue Divisional Officer would be in the nature of a judicial or quasijudicial process and it would be right to say that so far as such persons are concerned the requirements of the statute must be complied with but persons who have no such antecedent rights would be amenable to the general superintending power possessed by Collectors and the <ORG> and the <ORG> therefore and by virtue of this power the <ORG> and the <ORG> can interfere He went on All the administrative and executive acts of any authority under the <ORG> are subject to the overall control of the <ORG> the power of the <ORG> to interfere and revise the orders of these subordinate authorities is derived from the power of the <ORG> to govern Where the power exercised by the authorities subordinate to the <ORG> may be described as judicial or quasi judicial process <ORG> may not have power to intervene There is no interdict on fresh or new ideas But for drawing a distinction between persons with antecedent rights and those without antecedent rights when provision as regards both these categories of persons are made in the statute there is no warrant whatsoever The contention is opposed to what seems to us to be a sound rule that where the statute has made provision in respect of particular matters it is to the statute that we must look for the determination of the rights of individuals and not to the vague and indefinite background of the overall powers of the <ORG> The conclusion we have reached is that neither the <ORG> nor the <ORG> have power to interfere with the order made by the District Collector
