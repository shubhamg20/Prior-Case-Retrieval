He had already given a notice dated to the appellant terminating the tenancy and asking for vacation of the premises Since permission had been obtained to file a suit against the widow and not the sons and daughters of <NAME> and the notice terminating the tenancy had also been addressed to and served upon the widow alone it was pleaded that the notice was bad for that reason and the permission was also illegal and without jurisdiction The plea has not been pressed again at least in this Court and for obvious reasons as it has been held in several decisions of this Court that it is not necessary that the notice under Section of the Transfer of Property Act be given only after the permission to evict has been obtained For these reasons he held the notice to have been rightly given to the appellant alone In the appeal filed by the defendant Smt It may be noted here that another second civil appeal No of with a similar plea about invalidity of notice given to one co tenant only was also tacked with this appeal under decision after it had been heard in part and this appeal is being decided after hearing also learned counsel for both the sides in that other second appeal At the outset it may be stated that there is no controversy on the proposition that even in the case of a monthly tenancy the tenancy is inherited by the heirs of the tenant on his death If the <ORG> decision in AIR SC can be said to be in relation to a case of joint tenants in such ordinary sense of the expression then it would be directly relevant to the instant case but if it laid down law of sufficiency of notice to determine lease by being given to one of the co tenants to a case where the co tenants were holding the tenancy by way of an estate of joint tenancy then the decision would be distinguishable though the point would still require decision whether in other cases of joint tenancy also notice to one of the joint tenants will not be good and effective in law for the purpose of terminating the tenancy The land had been leased by the Trustees of <ORG> on a monthly tenancy to two persons Some years later the Trustees of <ORG> sent a notice to <NAME> and <NAME> requiring them to vacate the premises and deliver vacant and peaceful possession on a certain date On non compliance with the notice the suit was instituted against both the persons By the deed of assignment dated February the tenants took the premises as joint tenants It can very well be argued that the expression joint tenants used in the deed of assignment and used in the above paragraph by their Lordships of <ORG> was meant to convey no other sense than that <NAME> and <NAME> did not take separate and exclusive interests under the assignment and that they were joint tenants in the sense that they were to hold the lease jointly and not with separate Interests therein It was observed at page column of the report That is clear from the emphasis placed by their Lordships on the circumstance that the tenants took the premises as joint tenants the deed of assignment by which they acquired the lease expressly providing that they were taking as joint tenants Where joint owners are joint tenants there is unity of title unity of interest and the right of survivorship in addition to unity of possession so that it might be said that any one of the joint tenants represents the entire estate indeed in the <ORG> case already referred to it would appear that one of the two joint tenants had died and the lease had vested solely in the other by survivorship before notice to quit was served on the other so that there was no question of the legal representatives of the deceased joint tenant having any interest whatsoever in the lease so as to require that notice should go to them The learned Judge proceeded further to observe at page column Where however the joint owners are only tenants in common there is only unity of possession not of title or interest and to determine a tenancy so held in accordance with Section of the Transfer of Property Act notice must be addressed to all the tenants though proof of service on one will be prima facie proof of service on all In the words of the section notice must go to every party intended to be bound by it and if it is not issued to any of the joint owners of the lease there is no determination of the lease so far as he is concerned A lease cannot be determined piecemeal and hence it follows that there is no determination even so far as the others are concerned The argument in the second quotation will be discussed later on but the observation in the latter part of the first quotation itself would indicate that their Lordships of <ORG> had not in their mind the consideration that <NAME> and <NAME> were owners of the tenancy as joint tenants in the special sense with the right of survivorship as an incident thereof for in that case it would have been enough for their Lordships to dispose of the controversy by merely saying that upon the death of <NAME> his interest passed to <NAME> and he became the sole lessee with no necessity in consequence of any notice going to the heirs of <NAME> or of their impleadment as defendants in the suit There was a suit by the landlords of a piece of land against the tenants and sub tenants who were actually in possession It may also be stated that they had come to possess what was formerly the tenancy holding of one <NAME> and that they were being treated as tenants in place of <NAME> who was treated as dead The per sonal tender or delivery may take place anywhere the vicarious tender or delivery must take place at the residence of the person intended to be bound by the notice About this case it has been argued on the appellant side that as a matter of fact notice was issued to all the seven co tenants and the notice was also held to have been sufficiently served on each one of them and in the circumstances the observation that in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and service of a notice to quit upon one joint co tenant is evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants is prima facie an obiter dicta There were three English cases cited in that connection In none of these cases however the question arose whether a notice addressed to one or some only of the joint tenants and served upon him or some was sufficient to terminate the tenancy since the notice was addressed to all In the Calcutta case the <ORG> case cited above was distinguished on the ground that the notices were addressed to all the joint tenants by being sent to all of them The first case was said to have no value because in India the matter is governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act About the other case it was said that the matter was left to the Jury It cannot be supposed that their Lordships of the <ORG> had not in mind the statutory provision in Section of the Transfer of Property Act when they laid down the rule that in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and it has long ago been decided that service of a notice to quit upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other Ioint tenants The relevant part of Section is in the following words Every notice under this section must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the person giving it and either be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such party or to one of his family or servants at his residence or if such tender or delivery is not practicable affixed to a conspicuous part of the property One requirement under the above quoted provision is about the form of the notice namely that it should be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the person giving it If the words party who is intended to be bound by it are interpreted to mean each one of the co tenants where the tenancy is held by more than one person jointly then notice must be served on each one of the co tenants and that would be in direct conflict with the rule about which there is no controversy that service of a notice on one of the co tenants would be sufficient service in respect of all provided it is addressed to all The fact of its being addressed to all will be immaterial if the notice must be served on each co tenant individually in order that all of them may be bound It must be in this background that it was laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> case AIR PC that well in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound in other words if a notice is given to one of the joint tenants it means that the joint tenants as a whole are intended to be bound by the notice It is an incident of tenancy that it is one and even though more than one person may hold it they hold it together as one So even if a notice is addressed to one or some of the co tenants it must be effective as against all the only limitation to this being that there is nothing to show that the tenancy is intended to be terminated piecemeal and it is clear that the intention is to terminate the tenancy as a whole It appears that it is by way of this safeguard that while laying down the rule in the several decisions mentioned above that service of notice on one co tenant will be sufficient service of notice for terminating the tenancy that the qualification has been added that the notice should be addressed to all the co tenants In this connection the following passages from the report of AIR Bom which if I may say so with respect contain also my line of thinking may be usefully reproduced In this connection it is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the provisions of Section of Hindu Succession Act in terms lay down that property acquired by heirs who inherit by intestate succession is acquired by them as tenants in common and not as joint tenants In my judgment the phrase tenants in common or joint tenants used in Section of the Hindu Succession Act or in other texts when considering the rights of owners of property inter se cannot be confused with the right to hold land as joint tenant in the sense as joint lessees or co lessees or co tenants of property such as the subject matter of the suit The word tenant in Section is not used in the sense of lessees That word is used in the sense of owners of property whether they are joint owners of property or holding in defined shares I accordingly hold that both on the authority of <NAME> case AIR SC aforesaid and otherwise i if it applies only to joint tenants with right of survivorship the notice served on the appellant was sufficient to terminate the tenancy since on the facts of this case it must be inferred that by the notice it was intended to terminate the tenancy as a whole and not in part
