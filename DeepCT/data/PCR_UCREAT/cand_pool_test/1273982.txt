HEADNOTE The appellant was the Managing Director of a bank and held a power of attorney to act on behalf of its Directors and authorising him to borrow money on behalf of the bank The appellant pledged the securities with a third party to get a loan for the bank use and on its failure to repay the same on demand the creditors sold the securities for realising their dues That the delivery of the securities by the <ORG> made the <ORG> a trustee for him and he remained the owner subject to any especial interest created in favour of the <ORG> by the agreement and in a case such as the present where there was no question of redeeming the securities by the <ORG> there having been no overdraft or sale by the <ORG> in enforcement of any especial interest as none had accrued to it <ORG> had no right to deal with the securities The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by special leave directed against the concurrent orders and judgments of the courts below convicting the appellant under section Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment for three months and a fine of Rs He held a power of attorney to act as the Managing Director on behalf of the Directors of the Company as security against the overdraft facilities granted to <ORG> and that there was no overdraft against the said securities on that date On the st October a charge sheet was submitted by the police under section Indian Penal Code against the appellant in respect of the securities of the face value of Rs On the th April the charge as quoted above was framed against the appellant He also had a power of attorney from the <ORG> to act jointly with another person with a similar power of attorney The most important witness examined on behalf of the prosecution is <NAME> Like the previous witness he also had a power of attorney to act only in conjunction with another per son holding a similar power He also corroborates the previous witness and states that there was a crisis in the bank from about the middle of February and that there was a heavy rush on the bank from that time till it closed down He makes the following very significant statement I had handed over the two securities belonging to <ORG> to the accused for being handed over to <ORG> against the loan In fact the accused himself told me to bring securities pleged by <ORG> with <ORG> He also makes detailed statements as to the different kinds of interest which the appellant had in <ORG> The Insurance Company and its branches had a current account with <ORG> and had advanced to the latter six to seven lakhs of rupees as call deposits Shortly stated it is to the effect that the charge framed against him is bad in law and extremely vague that the vagueness of the charge had considerably handicapped his defence that the prosecution had not been fair in that it had not exa mined the first informant <NAME> that if he had been examined by the prosecution the appellant would have shown from the records in his possession that <ORG> had not suffered any loss and that the <ORG> in the hands of the Liquidator had more than sufficient funds to pay the dues of the former that the prosecution bad not been launched with the sanction of the Company Judge who was in seisin of the liquidation proceedings in respect of the Exchange <ORG> and that therefore the provisions of sections and of the Indian Companies Act had not been complied with that the securities in question had not been entrusted to the appellant but to the Exchange <ORG> if at all there was any entrustment and that as a matter of fact and law the Ex change <ORG> had not been entrusted with the securities that the Exchange <ORG> Court legally deal with the securities in any manner it liked as provided in the documents Exs Grievance was also sought to be made of the fact that Inspector <NAME> who had investigated the case had not been called as a prosecution witness with the result that the appellant had been deprived of the right of challenging the prosecution evidence with reference to the police diary The learned Magistrate after a very fair and full examination of the evidence in the case and the points raised by the appellant in his defence came to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust under section Indian Penal Code and passed a lenient sentence as stated above in view of the consideration that not a pie went to the pocket of the accused and that the accused had not taken up any dishonest defence As regards want of sanction of the Company Judge he held that section of the lndian Companies Act had no application to the facts of the present case as it was not a prosecution under the Companies Act and that therefore no such sanction as is contemplated by that section was necessary Dealing with the appellant contention that there was no entrustment within the meaning of section Indian Penal Code the learned Magistrate observed that the accused held delegated powers from <ORG> and he held the property in trust on behalf of the Directors of the Exchange <ORG> He further held that the contract of pledge dated the th May between the two banks did not vest any right in the Exchange <ORG> absolutely to deal with the securities and that at any rate the Exchange <ORG> could not deal with the securities so long as the Cooperative <ORG> had not taken an overdraft from the former In dealing with the question whether the appellant had dealt with the securities dishonestly he held that in all the circumstances of the case there was no doubt that wrongful loss was caused to <ORG> and wrongful gain not to the accused personally but to the Exchange <ORG> which he represented during the transactions in question Dealing with a new point raised before the appeal court namely that the appellant was under a mistake of fact or law as to the indebtedness of <ORG> to <ORG> or as to its powers to deal with the security <ORG> held that there was no possibility of the appellant having made any mistake of fact in good faith While dealing with the appeal on the question of sentence <ORG> pointed out that there was good evidence to support the inference that the appellant had been actuated by motives of personal benefit also appellant moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal But that charge was not an absolute one without reference to the state of accounts between the two banks in other words there would be a charge only when there was an adverse balance against <ORG> The right of <ORG> to deal with the securities under the agreement would arise only on the happening of certain events namely that the <ORG> either had failed to maintain the proper margin or had made a default in repayment of the outstanding amount on demand by <ORG> So long as those contingencies did not arise and it is nobody case that any of those contingencies had arisen the pledgee bank had no right to deal with the securities by way of pledge sub pledge or assignment In this connection our attention was invited to the provisions of section of the Indian Contract Act in support of the contention that as the securities had been agreed between the two banks to be a cover for overdraft not exceeding Rs It was further argued that as there was nothing to show that the appellant had dealt with the securities for a larger amount than that he could not be said to have contravened the terms of the contract In our opinion there is no substance in this contention If <ORG> had as a matter of fact operated upon the overdraft account and bad drawn any sum with in the limit aforesaid <ORG> would have an interest pro tanto in those securities and might then have been entitled to pledge or sub pledge the securities with a third party Hence there is no difficulty in holding that on the terms of the contract between the two banks the appellant was not entitled to transfer any interest in those securities and if be did so he did it in contravention of the terms of the contract We will now deal with the legal position apart from the terms of the contract The <ORG> has in the present case only transferred his possession of the property to the pledgee who has a special interest in the property of enforcing his charge for payment of an overdraft if any whereas the property continues to be owned by the <ORG> It is open to the <ORG> to redeem the pledge by full payment of the amount for which the pledge had been made at any time if there is no fixed period for redemption or at any time after the date fixed and such a right of redemption continues until the thing pledged is lawfully sold We have therefore to examine whether or not there was mens rea in this case or whether the necessary element of a criminal It has been contended that no offence under section Indian Penal Code has been brought home to the appellant for the reasons that there was no entrustment that there was no mens rea and that there was no dishonesty on the part of the appellant It has been argued that in this case there was no such entrustment as is contemplated by that section and that the securities were pledged with <ORG> by <ORG> which was in the position of a debtor to the former But when section which defines criminal breach of trust speaks of a person being in any manner entrusted with property it does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trust It was next argued that assuming that the essential ingredients of an offence under section Indian Penal Code had been made out the appellant may have made a mistake of fact in assuming that <ORG> was indebted to <ORG> or may have made a mistake of law in mistakenly believing that <ORG> had the right as the pledgee to sub pledge those securities for raising money for its own purposes But it was argued that it had not been proved that the appellant had that knowledge Hence in our opinion there is no room for the supposition that the appellant was not aware of the true state of accounts bet ween the two banks We note that here the appellant made no attempt in the trial court to set up such a defence If he had ever said that he made a mistake of fact after exercising due care and caution that there was an overdraft against <ORG> in favour of <ORG> he may have been able to take advantage of the exception But as in this case there was no mistake of fact and as the court was in a position to find that the appellant must have known that there was no such overdraft there is no room for the application of section quoted above But as there was no mistake about the basic fact the provisions of section Indian Penal Code are not attracted to this case It now remains to deal with certain objections relating to the illegality or irregularity in the procedure followed in the trial of this case The relevant portion of section is as follows The official liquidator shall have power with the sanction of the <ORG> to do the following things a to institute or defend any suit or prosecution or other legal proceeding civil or criminal in the name and on behalf of the company In terms the section lays down the powers of the official liquidator The prosecution was started on a charge sheet submitted by the police though the first information report had been lodged by an official under the official liquidator This is not a case which can come even by analogy within the rule laid down by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> King Emperor that a prosecution launched without the previous sanction of the <ORG> within the meaning of clause of the Drugs Control Order was completely null and void Where the legislature intended to place a limitation on the powers of the court to take cognisance of an offence unless certain conditions were fulfilled like the provisions of sections and Criminal Procedure Code it has used words such as these No court shall take cognisance There is nothing in section of the Companies Act which can be construed as restricting the powers of the court to take cognisance of an offence or the powers of the police to initiate prosecution or even of a private citizen to move the machinery of the criminal courts to bring an offender like the appellant to justice It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the charge is materially defective in so far as the nature of the breach of trust the facts constituting the breach the exact date and manner of the breach have not been set out The charge as framed fulfils the requirements of section Criminal Procedure Code because it has mentioned the name of the offence namely criminal breach of trust and specified section Indian Penal Code which impliedly gives notice to the accused of every legal condition required by law to be fulfilled in order to constitute the offence of criminal breach of trust In our opinion though the charge could have been more detailed as was intended by the learned Magistrate as framed it gives the accused sufficient notice of the nature of the offence alleged against him Even assuming that there were certain omissions in the charge they cannot be regarded as material unless in terms of section of the Code it is shown by the accused that he had in fact been misled by such omission or that there had been a failure of justice as a result of such error or omission In this case from the long written statement filed on behalf of the appellant it is clear that he was aware of the gravamen of the charge against him and that he tried to meet it in all its bearings We are not therefore impressed by the argument advanced on his behalf that the omissions in the charge are material and that the case should be tried over again on a fresh charge The learned Judges of <ORG> constituting <ORG> which heard the appeal have written separate but concurring judgments but they did not notice any argument having been advanced before them on the question of the illegality or irregularity in the charge In our opinion this is not a case in which it can be said that the omission in the charge has materially affected the trial of the case or prejudiced the appellant in his defence or has occasioned a failure of justice
