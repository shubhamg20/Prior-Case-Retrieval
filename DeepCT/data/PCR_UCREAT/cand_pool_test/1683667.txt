The appellant filed a writ application in <ORG> on the ground that there could be no assessment under clause because he resided outside the jurisdiction of <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of <ORG> at Allahabad dated the th of May by which <ORG> dismissed an application of the appellant for the issue of a writ of certiorari under the provisions of article of the Constitution The appeal raises the question of the validity of the assessment of a tax on the appellant for the year by <ORG> under the provisions of clause of sub section of section of the United Provinces Town Areas Act The appellant preferred an appeal against the assessment of the tax under section of the Act and the grounds taken by the appellant were that he did not reside within the limits of the Town Area and that he did not carry on any trade or business within that Area He accordingly dismissed the appeal application of the appellant took the view that the tax imposed on the appellant could clearly be imposed under clause of sub section of section of the Act therefore it was unnecessary to consider whether the tax could be legally imposed under clause of sub section of section The learned Judge also expressed the view that residence within the Town Area was not a pre requisite condition for the imposition of the tax under clause and it was enough if the appellant carried on a trade or business within the Town Area With regard to his second point learned counsel has drawn our attention to sections to of the Act He has pointed out that under section of the Act a list of persons liable to pay the tax imposed under section and of the amounts to be paid respectively by such persons has to be prepared the list may be revised by the District Magistrate and has to be submitted to him for confirmation the list can only be altered under sub section of section by the District Magistrate or in pursuance of an order passed in appeal under the provisions of section Therefore the legality of the tax imposed on the appellant must be considered with reference to the clause under which the assessment was actually made and a different clause under which the assessment might have fallen cannot be called in aid of the assessment We proceed therefore to consider the legality of the tax imposed on the appellant with reference to clause of sub section of section of the Act It will be noticed that the power of <ORG> to impose a tax under clause is subject to first any general rules or special orders of <ORG> in this behalf and secondly to such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed These restrictions and limitations are to be found in the Rules made by <ORG> under section of the Act which are called Rules regarding the Limitations Restrictions and Rate sub ject to which the Circumstances and Property Tax shall be levied by <ORG> The tax assessed on the circumstances of an assessee may be imposed on any person residing or carrying on business within the limits of the town area Provided that such person has so resided or carried on business for a total period of at least six months in the year of assessment The important point which emerges out of these Rules is that under Rule the tax assessed on the circumstances of an assessee may be imposed on any person residing or carrying on business within the limits of the town area in other words two conditions in the alternative are laid down in Rule either the person must reside within the limits of the town area or he must be carrying on business within the limits of the said area There is a third condition that the residence or carrying on of business must be for a total period of at least six months in the year of assessment No question regarding the third condition has been raised in this case and it is not necessary to consider that condition here The Rules make it quite clear that for each of the clauses of sub section of section there is a nexus between the territorial jurisdiction of <ORG> and the imposition of the tax Section of the Amending Act gave retrospective effect to the amendments The proviso is intended to avoid multiple taxation but it is manifest from the proviso that there may be overlapping of the different clauses in sub section of section for example a person may come under clause as well as clause if he carries on a trade within the limits of the Town Area If residence within the limits of the Town Area were a sine qua non for the imposition of a tax under clause no question of overlapping between clauses and would arise unless the person to be taxed resided as well as carried on a trade within the limits of the Town Area Secondly there are several other sections of the Act such as section and section which show that the imposition of a tax on persons not resident within the Town Area Thirdly the question of the validity of sub section of section A does not arise in this case The appellant was assessed to a tax and he had a right to file an appeal which right he exercised It is worthy of note that under section of the District Boards Act the power of a Board to impose a tax on circumstances and property is subject to the condition that the tax may be imposed on any person residing or carrying on business in the rural area within <ORG> If it shows anything it shows that it was open to <ORG> to impose a circumstances and property tax on any person residing or carrying on business in the rural area In the Allahabad decision the main question was whether the provisions of section Professions Tax Limitation Act affected the powers conferred upon <ORG> by section of the District Boards Act to levy a tax on circumstances and property With regard to the main question it was pointed out that the name given to a tax did not matter what had to be considered was the pith and substance of it The meanings of words and expressions used in an Act must take their colour from the context in which they appear We have already stated that though the clauses are different the words used in the section show that there may be overlapping between the different clauses and to prevent the same person being subjected to multiple taxation a proviso was incorporated in clause In view of the words and expressions used in section of the Act we cannot accept the argument that clause should be read as entirely independent of and unconnected with the other clauses and a different condition namely residence within the Town Area must be read as a necessary part of clause
