It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that no expenditure could be allowed as a deduction from the profits of a business unless the part of the business to which the expenditure was attributable was capable of producing income or profits liable to be taxed under the Act There is nothing in the language of of the Indian Income tax Act from which it can be fairly implied that an expenditure or allowance falling within the section must fulfill some other condition before it can be allowed There is no provision which would justify looking behind the expenditure if it fell within the term of sub to see whether it had the quality of directly or indirectly producing taxable income Appeal by special leave from the judgment dated November of <ORG> in No of For the assessment year accounting year Calendar Year it claimed a deduction of Rs The learned counsel for the <ORG> Mr <NAME> submits that there is a general principle that no expenditure can be allowed as a deduction from the profits of a business unless the part of the business to which the expenditure is attributable is capable of producing income or profits liable to be taxed under the Act In other words he contends that if a part of profits of a business is not taxable no expenditure incurred for the purpose of earning those profits can be allowed as a deduction He says this is the position specially after the amendments made in the Act by the Amending Act of in whereby all income accruing or deemed to accrue to a person resident in India is attributed a taxable quality There is force in the contention of Mr <NAME> and the appeal must fail on this ground alone Then is there such a principle as has been formulated above If there is one can it be invoked to cut down the express language of iii which expressly allows as a deduction interest on capital borrowed for the purpose of the business In our opinion If there is ambiguity in the terms of a provision recourse must naturally be had to well established principles of construc tion but it is not permissible first to create an artificial ambiguity and then try to resolve the ambiguity by resort to some general principle There are no words in to that effect Therefore it seems to us that there is nothing in the language of from which it can be fairly implied that an expenditure or allowance falling within the section must fulfill some other condition before it can be allowed A similar question arose in England in <NAME> <ORG> and all the Judges took the view that interest paid by the <ORG> on capital borrowed in the course of its business and utilised in buying tax free securities had to be deducted in arriving at the taxable profits of the business notwithstanding that the interest earned by the <ORG> on the tax free securities could not be taxed After setting out the rule and noticing its effect he says It seems to me to be incontrovertible that in the present case the investments in question were part of the business of the Respondents trade and that the expense connected with them was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade Similarly <NAME> <NAME> could find no warrant in the language of the Statute to give effect to the contention of the <ORG> He observed that when the Statute says that interest is to be exempt I am quite unable to read it as meaning that in giving effect to that exemption by implication some repercussion is to take place on a different provision of the Act altogether I can find nothing in the Statute which requires this interest to be treated so to speak as a trade within a trade A number of Indian cases have been cited before us and we will now proceed to examine them This is apparent from the judgment and from the following observations of <NAME> Reading the provisions in section with the provision in section a and and section it seems clear to us that section when it talks of profits or gains has reference to taxable profits and gains in other words it has reference to such profits and gains as would have been assessable in British India or the taxable territories It has no reference to income accruing or arising without British India or without taxable territories which were not liable to be assessed in the case of non residents We cannot imply from this judgment that there is a general principle that if a part of the income of a business is tax free expenditure incurred for the purpose of earning this income is outside the purview of The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
