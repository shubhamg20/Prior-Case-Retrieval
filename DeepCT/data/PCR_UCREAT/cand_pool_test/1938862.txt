The respondent therefore filed suits in against the appellants alleging infringement of its trade marks Section confers a right on any person aggrieved by an entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by an entry wrongly remaining in the register to apply for expunging or varying such an entry Since an aggrieved person includes a person who has before registration used the trade mark and a person against whom an infringement action is taken and the words without sufficient cause relate to the time of original registration But in view of the language of no contention could be raised in the present case that the trade mark and Fifty were not distinctive under that is adapted to distinguish the cycle bells of the respondent at the date of registration as seven years had elapsed since the date of the Registration As against the voluminous sales of the respondent for the years there was no corresponding evidence on behalf of the appellants indicating sales of their bells with number from which any likelihood of confusion or deception could be deduced In the present case in fact there was no evidence of any fraud having been committed by the respondent at the time of the registration There was neither averment by the appellants nor evidence that <ORG> or any other foreign concern had obtained registration of trade marks of or Fifty nose concerns merely used various numerals for distinguishing one type of bell from another manufactured by them and there was no question of any piracy by the respondent If the proprietor is not in a position to use the mark to distinguish his goods from those of others or has abandoned it or the mark has become so common in the market that it has ceased to connect him with his goods then there would be no justification for retaining the mark on the register There were no repeated breaches which went unchallenged by the respondent when known to the respondent There was no evidence to show that the use by others of the word Fifty or the numeral was substantial and the plea that there was common use of the trade marks must fail The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These two appeals under certificate are directed against the common judgment and order of <ORG> dated February passed in four Letters Patent appeals filed by the two appellant companies and the respondent company against the judgment and order of a learned Single Judge of <ORG> The learned Single Judge also found that there was no evidence of the original registration having been fraudulently obtained by the respondent company that there was no averment by the appellant companies that <ORG> or any other concern had obtained registration of any mark either of the numeral or the figure Fifty and that therefore cl a of did not apply So far as the trade mark of the figure Fifty was concerned he held that there was no evidence that it was used by other parties either prior to or after the registration thereof by the respondent company and in that view declined to rectify or expunge the trade mark Fifty as seven years had already elapsed by the time the rectification proceedings were launched and could not therefore be challenged on the ground of absence of distinctiveness as laid down in In the appeals filed against the said judgment <ORG> of <ORG> held that though the use of the numeral in relation to cycle bells dated back at least years as in the case of <NAME> and certain other foreign concerns the imports of such goods stopped from about though some bells were being sold till presumably from the remaining previous stock that the numeral in connection with those foreign made bells was never intended as a trade mark but was used only as an indication of the type or quality and that statements Exs <ORG> agreed with the Trial Judge that cl a of did not apply as there was no question of the original registration having been fraudulently procured in It also held that the trade marks in question could not be cancelled merely on the ground that if their registration had been opposed they would not have been registered and that therefore the question for determination was whether it was liable to cancellation in view of which lays down that the section would not apply in cases where the trade mark in question was not distinctive at the commencement of the proceedings <ORG> held that though there was some evidence of the use of the numeral by certain other concerns after no importance could be attached to such breaches as there was hardly any evidence as to when the infringers started manufacturing and the extent of their manufacture and sales and that the correct principle applicable in such cases was that a few unchallenged scattered infringements by a number of traders did not render a registered trade mark common Even if the idea of using the two marks might have been conceived by the respondent company from the marks used by <NAME> and other foreign concerns there was no question of any piracy or infringement of those marks as the respondent company was the first to convert what were originally type marks into registered trade marks Mr <NAME> for the appellant companies contended that the two trade marks in question were liable to cancellation on the grounds that they were common and not distinctive at the date of their registration and therefore ought never to have been registered that in any event the numeral is prima facie not distinctive unless shown to be of such extensive use as to make it distinctive that there was clear evidence that the respondent company had imitated the use of these marks by <NAME> and other manufacturers and that therefore these marks would be disentitled to protection in a court of law and that the said marks were not at the commencement of the proceedings distinctive that is adapted to distinguish the goods of the respondent company Mr <NAME> on the other hand argued that the two marks having been registered in and seven years since then having elapsed at the commencement of these proceedings the question whether they were distinctive at the time of registration was not open to dispute that that being so there was no question of any alleged piracy by the respondent company of the marks of <NAME> and other concerns and therefore the marks could not be said to be disentitled to protection by a court that the marks had not lost their distinctiveness at the date of these proceedings under and that <ORG> was therefore justified in dismissing these proceedings by the appellant companies A trade mark as difined in means in relation to Chapter i for offences and penalties provided in that chapter a registered trade mark or a mark used in relation to the goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right as proprietor to use the mark and in relation to the other provisions of the Act a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to the goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right either as proprietor or as registered user to use the mark and includes a certification trade mark registered as such under the provisions of Chapter VIII These are marks the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion or the use of which would be contrary to any law or which comprises or contains scandalous or obscene matters or any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class or section of the citizens or which would otherwise be disentitled to protection in a court He has only to produce the certificate of registra tion of his trade mark and that would be prima facie evidence of his title Such registration is prima facie evidence also in rectification applications under which means that the onus of proof is on the person making such application It would seem that the word distinctive in cl is presumably used in the same sense in which it is defined in as the definition of that expression therein commences with the words for the purposes of this Act and not the words for the purposes of this section the intention of the legislature thus being to give uniform meaning to that expression all throughout the Act deals with the power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register Sub thereof confers a right to any person aggrieved by an entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by an entry wrongly remaining in the register to apply to the tribunal for expunging or varying such an entry The expression aggrieved person has received liberal construction from the courts and includes a person who has before registration used the trade mark in question as also a person against whom an infringement action is taken or threatened by the registered proprietor of such a trade mark in clear terms provides that the original registration of a trade mark after expiry of seven years from the date of its registration shall be taken to be valid in all respects in all legal proceedings including those under except in the three categories of cases mentioned therein But both the learned Single Judge and <ORG> clearly found that there was no evidence of any fraud having been committed by the respondent company at the time of the registration that there was no averment by the appellant companies much less any evidence that <ORG> or any other foreign concerns had obtained registration of trade marks either of the numeral or the word Fifty that the indication on the contrary was that those concerns used the different nume rals etc Though there was some evidence that foreign made bells Such as <ORG> and were being sold as late as such sales must have been few and far between as they could only be from the remaining stock out of the earlier imports As against the voluminous sales by the respondent company shown by the statements filed by it for the years to there was no such corresponding evidence indicating the sales of other bells with numerals such as inscribed on them from which any likelihood of confusion or deception could be deduced Regarding deception there was indeed no evidence whatsoever in that regard There was no question of piracy also on the part of the respondent company as argued by counsel as there was nothing to show that <ORG> or any other foreign concerns used this numeral except for distinguishing one type of bell from another manufactured by them It had to be taken to be valid in all respects and what had to be taken to be valid in all respects was the registration of the trade mark unless it offended against the provisions of There then remains the question whether cl of applies i that the trade marks were not at the commencement of the proceedings distinctive of the goods of the respondent company The distinctiveness of the trade mark in relation to the goods of a registered proprietor of such a trade mark may be lost in a variety of ways by the goods not being capable of being distinguished as the goods of such a proprietor or by extensive piracy so that the marks become publici juris If the proprietor is not in a position to use the mark to distinguish his goods from those of others or has abandoned it or the mark has become so common in the market that it has ceased to connect him with his goods there would hardly be any justification in retaining it on the register rectification proceedings it makes no difference as it is not possible from the evidence on record to say that the trade marks in question were not or had ceased to be distinctive According To the appellant <ORG> it went into production only in and in the respondent company commenced action against it A similar notice of infringement followed by a suit was also given to <ORG> but the suit became infructuous on account of lack of the jurisdiction of <ORG> where it was filed It would however be a different matter if it is shown that there were repeated undisturbed infringements The evider in the present case does not show that there were repeated breaches which went unchallenged though known to the proprietor In our view the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant companies cannot be sustained and consequently the two appeals fail and are dismissed with costs
