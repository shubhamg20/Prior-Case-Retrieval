They were acquitted by the trial Court but on appeal <ORG> convicted them under acquitted them under ss and held that the prosecution under was barred by a Criminal Procedure Code which requires a complaint in writing by the public servant before a court could take cognizance of the offence Therefore the trial of the appellants for the distinct offence under was not barred though it was based practically on the same facts as for the prosecution under and <ORG> was justified on the evidence in interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the trial Court in regard to that charge The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is brought by special leave from the judgment of <ORG> dated March in Government Appeal No of by which <ORG> set aside the order of acquittal passed by the Assistant Sessions Judge of Puri and convicted the appellants under of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to months rigorous imprisonment <NAME> also searched hi pockets and <NAME> threatened the <ORG> by saying that he would not leave the place until the money was returned The State Government took the matter in appeal to <ORG> High <ORG> which set aside the order of acquittal with regard to the appellants and convicted them under Indian Penal Code The High <ORG> however held that there was no satisfactory evidence to convict the appellants under ss Indian Penal Code Learned Counsel took us through the judgments of <ORG> and of the trial court and stressed the argument that there was no evidence upon which <ORG> reached the finding that the appellants used criminal force against Ws I and It was pointed out in that case that there is no doubt that the power conferred by cl a of which deals with an appeal against an order of acquittal is as wide as the power conferred by el which deals with an appeal against an order of conviction and so it is obvious that the High <ORG> powers in dealing with criminal appeals are equally wide whether the appeal in question is one against acquittal or against conviction It was observed that the test suggested by the expression substantial and compelling reasons for reversing a judgment of acquittal should not be construed as a formula which has to be rigidly applied in every case and so it is not necessary that before reversing a judgment of acquittal the High <ORG> must necessarily characterise the findings recorded therein as perverse We pass on to consider the next contention of the appellants that the conviction of the appellants under Indian Penal Code is illegal because there is a contravention of of the Criminal Procedure Code which requires a complaint in writing by the process server or the A I It was submitted that the charge under Indian Penal Code is based upon the same facts as the charge under Indian Penal Code and no cognizance could be taken of the offence under Indian Penal Code unless there was a complaint in writing as required by of the Criminal Procedure Code It is pointed out in the <ORG> case that where upon the facts the commission of several offences is disclosed some of which require sanction and others do not it is open to the complainant to proceed in respect of those only which do not require sanction because to hold otherwise would amount to legislating and adding very materially to the provisions of ss to of the Code of Criminal Procedure In the present case therefore we are of the opinion that Criminal Procedure Code does not bar the trial of the appellants for the distinct offence under of the Indian Penal Code though it is practically based on the same facts as for the prosecution under Indian Penal Code Reference may be made in this connection to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> The Crown We have expressed the view that Criminal Procedure Code does not bar the trial of an accused person for a distinct offence disclosed by the same or slightly different set of facts and which is not included within the ambit of the section but we must point out that the provisions of cannot be evaded by resorting to devices or camouflage For instance the provisions of the section cannot be evaded by the device of charging a person with an offence to which that section does not apply and then convicting him of an offence to which it does on the ground that the latter offence is a minor one of the same character or by describing the offence as one punishable under some other section of the Indian Penal Code though in truth and substance the offence falls in the category of sections mentioned in Criminal Procedure Code But we are satisfied that there is no substance in this argument and there is no camouflage or evasion in the present case For these reasons we hold that the judgment of <ORG> dated March must be affirmed and this appeal must be dismissed
