This is an appeal against the Judgment of the High Court of Punjab dismissing in limine a petition filed by the three appellants in this appeal The third appellant purchased from one <NAME> a plot of land approximately sq The second appellant purchased a plot measuring sq on November adjacent to the land purchased by the first appellant from one <NAME> who in his turn had purchased it from <NAME> A notification had been issued by <ORG> under Section of the Land Acquisition Act on June declaring that land specified in the Schedule to the notification was needed for a public purpose i for construction of Mall Road leading from the Railway Station Bhatinda to the Main Road known as Goniana Bhatinda Road A notification under Section of the Land Acquisition Act declaring that the lands were needed for a public purpose was issued on January and published on January The appellants then filed a writ petition in <ORG> on December alleging that the substance of the notification under Section and its corrigendum was not published in the locality by the Collector that the proposed land which was sought to be acquired for the Mall Road was not demarcated at site under Section of the Act that the procedure laid down in Section A of the Act was not followed that the notification was vague and since the land sought to be acquired was not fully described in the notification the interested persons could not file their objections against the requisition that Khasra No was a very large plot of land consisting of several building plots which were all part of the main Khasra No and the original owners of this field number had divided this field into several abadi plots and had sold them to different persons before the notification and unless the portions of Khasra No sought to be acquired were specified by the mere reference to certain areas thereof the owners could not be deemed to have intimation that their plots were to be acquired and that the notification issued by the <ORG> under Section and the plan accompanying thereto did not tally with the alignment of the road as originally intended to be laid or subsequently modified by <ORG> The contention of the appellants is that they had no opportunity to avail themselves of their statutory right to object to the proposed acquisition under Section A of the Land Acquisition Act and on that account the proceedings for acquisition are ultra vires But the acquiring authority is bound to publish sufficient information giving due notice to the owners of the lands that their properties are intended to be compulsorily acquired The Collector has then to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient place in the locality After the notification is issued the Collector may exercise the power to enter upon and survey the land and set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work proposed to be made thereon By Section A any person interested in any land notified under Section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a Company may within thirty days after the issue of the notification submit in writing to the Collector his objection to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be The Collector has to give to the objector an opportunity of being heard and has after hearing the objections and making such further inquiry as he thinks necessary to submit the case for the decision of the appropriate <ORG> together with the record of the proceedings held by him and a report containing his recommendations on the objections Under Section of the Act the <ORG> may proceed to make a notification only if the <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report of the Collector under Section A that the land is needed for a public purpose The inquiry and the report under Section A may be dispensed with only if a notification is issued under Section of the Land Acquisition Act The owners of the lands were therefore entitled to be heard on the question whether their lands or any land in the locality should be acquired for the purpose for which it was intended to be acquired The appellants contended that they had no opportunity of making their representations for the notification gave no notice to them that the land in their occupation was intended to be acquired Again the jurisdiction of the Collector depended upon the issue of a valid notification and the mere fact that the Collector was satisfied that the true area of land demarcated Corresponded to the area notified whatever that expression may mean did not prevent the owners of the lands from contending before <ORG> that they had no opportunity of making their representations under Section A of the Act and of satisfying the Collector that their lands should not be acquired There is no evidence on the record that the entire area of khasra No was intended to be acquired In paragraph of the petition it is also averred that there was no due publication of the notification in the locality by the Collector The pleas raised by the petitioners about the infirmity in the notification and the proceedings for compulsory acquisition were serious <ORG> observed that they will not determine disputed question of fact in a writ petition But what facts were in dispute and what were admitted could only be determined after an affidavit in reply was filed by the State <ORG> is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Article merely because in considering the petitioners right to relief questions of fact may fall to be determined In a petition under Article <ORG> has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact ana law Exercise of the jurisdiction is it is true discretionary but the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles When the petition raises questions of fact of a complex nature which may for their determination require oral evidence to be taken and on that account <ORG> is of the view that the dispute may not appropriately be tried in a writ petition <ORG> may decline to try a petition Rejection or a petition in limine will normally be justified where <ORG> is of the view that the petition is frivolous or because of the nature of the claim made dispute sought to be agitated or that the petition against the party against whom relief is claimed is not maintainable or that the dispute raised thereby is such that it would be inappropriate to try it in the writ jurisdiction or for analogous reasons From the averments made in the petition filed by the appellants it is clear that in proof of a large number of allegations the appellants relied upon documentary evidence and the only matter in respect of which conflict of facts may possibly arise related to the due publication of the notification under Section by the Collector In the present case in our judgment <ORG> was not justified in dismissing the petition on the ground that it will not determine disputed question of fact <ORG> has jurisdiction to determine questions of fact even if they are in dispute and the present in our judgment is a case in which in the interests of both the parties <ORG> should have entertained the petition and called for an affidavit in reply from the respondents and should have proceeded to try the petition instead of relegating the appellants to a separate suit It was urged by Mr <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> Bhatinda that the three appellants were purchasers of the lands claimed by them after the notification under Section was issued and they had no right to challenge the issue of the notification The appeal is therefore allowed and the order passed by <ORG> is set aside The proceeding is remanded to <ORG> with the direction that the petition be readmitted to its original Number and that in be heard and disposed of according to law after considering the affidavits in reply and the other evidence produced by the parties
