The plaintiffs who are the appellant here filed a suit on the foot of a mortgage Exhibit A<ORG> dated th February executed by the th respondent in favour of one <NAME> The contesting respondents raised several questions but the most important of them were covered by issues and in the suit They raised the question whether the plaintiffs were entitled to sue for their share of the mortgage amount alone and whether the suit as a whole was barred by limitation as a necessary party had been impleaded out of time The learned Subordinate Judge held that as the Official Receiver was brought on record the suit was not barred and that the plaintiffs could maintain the suit for their th share <NAME> who heard the appeal held that the omission to implead the Official Receiver as a party defendant before the expiry of twelve years from the date fixed for redemption of the mortgage was fatal to the whole suit and in that view he dismissed the suit They held that the mortgagor would not be affected by the suit as the claim of the other mortgagee was barred by the time the suit came up for hearing and that therefore there would be no case of a second suit being filed We are unable to agree with the learned Judges who decided this case And save as a matter of special arrangement and bargain entered into between of all the persons interested neither the mortgagor nor the mortgagee nor persons acquiring through either a partial interest in the subject can under the mortgage get relief except in consonance with the principle of indivisibility referred to Justice can be done between all the parties concerned only by providing in the decree for the distribution of the sale proceeds amongst the co mortgagees They were added subsequently at a time when the claim in respect of the mortgage had become barred by limitation The principle therefore is that there is indivisibility of the mortgage both in regard to the debt as well as in regard to the security and that no suit can be filed to enforce a mortgage which entails the disintegration of either of them In the present case there is a further factor to be taken into account The mortgage was originally executed in favour of a single individual namely <NAME> The persons claiming the mortgage right are the several heirs of that lady who jointly get that right on her death by devolution under the law The learned Judges held that one of several co mortgagees who are in the position of tenants in common could sue to recover his share of the mortgage amount provided that he made his co mortgagees defendants if they refused to join him as plaintiffs and he sued for the entire mortgage debt by paying the proper <ORG> fee thereon The learned Judges referred to the various cases and held that a decree should be passed in respect of the entire debt and that the plaintiff could not get his share until the mortgagor had paid into <ORG> what he owed under the mortgage or the mortgaged property had been sold under the preliminary decree where it was held that a co mortgagee whose share in the mortgage money is defined or is otherwise ascertainable could maintain a mortgage suit for the share of his dues only if the other co mortgagees are made defendants in the suit and if in such a suit there was a prayer for taking accounts of the total dues under the mortgage and for the sale of the whole of mortgaged premises for such dues On the question of amount of <ORG> fees to be paid for such a suit the learned Judges expressed a different view We have referred to the decision in <NAME> Rachappa I Bom Normally all the mortgagees should join but if some of them refuse to join they should be included as defendants In such a case the omission to implead some of the persons interested in the equity of redemption will not entail the dismissal of the suit as the rights of the parties who are before the <ORG> can be adjudicated leaving the rights of others not made parties to the action unaffected
