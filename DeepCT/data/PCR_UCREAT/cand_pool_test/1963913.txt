If it is held that <ORG> by the exercise of its power of eminent domain can acquire choses in action and money belonging to its citizens by paying a fraction of the money taken as compensation the fundamental right guaranteed under Art A law which authorises the <ORG> to deprive a person of his property must be a valid law which means that it must satisfy the requirements of Art The word law used in Art The Act which empowers the <ORG> to appropriate some one else property for itself solely with a view to augment the resources of the <ORG> cannot be considered as a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In these connected appeals by certificates the question that arises for decision is whether the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Cash Grants Act of Act No XVI of is ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution <ORG> rejected all the contentions advanced on behalf of the respondents excepting one namely that the Act is ultra vires of Art the State of Madhya Pradesh has filed these appeals Before the impugned Act was enacted the State of Madhya Bharat which forms part of the new State of Madhya Pradesh purported to abolish the cash grants payable by it by means of an executive order It may be noted that in that appeal the appellant challenged the order in question on two grounds namely that as his right to receive the cash grant had been statutorily recognised by the State of Gwalior it was not open to <ORG> to exiting that right merely by an executive order and that that right being property the same could not be divested without payment of compensation under Art of the Constitution This Court allowed the appeal on the first ground and consequently it did not deal with the second It received the assent of the President on July and was published in <ORG> on August The Act comes into force on such date as the Government may by notification appoint We are given to under stand that in view of those petitions the Act has yet been brought into force Section bars the jurisdiction of civil courts to issue an injunction against any person in respect of any proceedings pending before the competent authority under which shall have the effect of staying the proceedings Section deals with the mode of payment of compensation Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out all or any of the purpose of the Act Section says that if any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of the Act the State Government May by order make such provisions not inconsistent with the purposes Of this Act as appears to be necessary or expedient for removing the difficulty Cash grant means a grant of money which is enforceable by the grantee against <ORG> on the date of the coming into force of this Act but does not include i a grant of money for a services of Public temples mosque or church or worship of public temples mosque or church or public temples ii a grant of money to charitable or religious institutions iii a grant of money or Pension or annuity or special or Perpetual annuity sanctioned under a of and sub of of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code of money which is enforceable by the grantee against <ORG> on the date of the coming into force of the Act but does This not include those rants which are specifically excluded There was controversy before <ORG> whether the abolition of cash grants under the Act can be considered as acquisition under Art It was urged before that Court on behalf of the <ORG> that that abolition of cash grant amounted to compulsory acquisition of property for public purpose and as the Act has prescribed the compensation payable to grantees the acquisition in question is completely protected by Art But there is no need to pursue this line of reasoning for reasons to be stated presently prima facie comprehends movable properties including choses in action and money there are valid grounds to hold that choses in action and money are outside the reach of Art jurists whether money and choses in action can be acquired in the exercise of the power of eminent domain though the preponderance of opinion appears to be that it is impermissible But so far as we are concerned this question is concluded by the decisions of this Court of the Report It was not necessary to decide in this case whether under the compulsory acquisition power the <ORG> has the power to acquire choses in action or money but it cannot be seriously disputed that such an acquisition amounts to a forced loan and that the desired result can be more appositely obtained in exercise of the police power of the <ORG> than of the power of eminent domain or compulsory acquisitions of property and that compensation in suc a case is the same amount of money that is being taken and in the case of a chose in action the amount of money that it would produce It has no connection with land reform or with any public purpose It stands on the same footing as other debts due to zamindars or their other movable properties which it was not the object of the Act to acquire As already stated the only purpose to support this acquisition is to raise revenue to pay compensation to some of the zamindars whose estates are being taken In the same case <NAME> as he then was observed Taking money under the tight of eminent domain when it must be compensated by money afterwards could be nothing more or less than a forced loan and it is difficult to say that it comes under the head of acquisi That lease considered the validity of of the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Act which provided that there should be constituted a fund called <ORG> and notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the same specified in sub thereof shall be paid into the fund The power conferred under Art That power cannot be utilised for enriching the coffers of the <ORG> If it is otherwise it would be permissible for the legislatures to enact laws acquiring the public debts due from the <ORG> he annuity deposits returnable by it and provident fund payable by it by providing for the payment of some nominal compensation to the persons whose rights are acquired as the acquisitions in question would augment the resources of the <ORG> In the former case the <ORG> was compulsorily taking others property and in the latter it seeks to appropriate to itself the property of others which is in its hands The said Article says that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law A law Which authorises the <ORG> to deprive a person of his property must be a valid law which means that it must satisfy the requirements of Art can be sustained only if the restrictions it imposes are reasonable and in the interest of the general public The Act which empowers the <ORG> to appropriate some one else property for itself solely with a view to augment the resources of the <ORG> cannot be considered as a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public There was some discussion before us as to the scope of this provision the point of the debate being whether the words imposing reasonable restriction if the word restriction was to be narrowly construed and that accordingly the power to restrict must be held to include in appropriate cases the power to prohibit the exercise of the right That view does find support in the observations of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> but the present legislation cannot be sustained even on the above interpretation of the word restriction as of the Act deals with moneys and money cannot be likened to diseased cattle or noxious drugs so as to attract the exercise of police power under Art
