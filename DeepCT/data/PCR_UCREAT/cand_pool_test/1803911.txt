The expression dealer so far as it is material is defined by section of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as meaning any person who carries on business of selling goods in the State of Bombay whether for commission remuneration or otherwise There is an exception to the definition which provides that an agriculturist who sells exclusively agricultural produce grown on land cultivated by him personally shall not be deemed to be a dealer within the meaning of the clause sugar cane is converted into gur for the purpose of transportation and preventing deterioration it is urged on behalf of the revenue that the assessee is a dealer within the meaning of the definition It is true that gur cannot be regarded as an agricultural produce grown on land But if gur is prepared out of the agricultural produce which is grown on land in the absence of any indication to the contrary suggesting that the agricultural produce must be sold in the form in which it is grown we will we justified in holding that an agriculturist who is exclusively selling agricultural produce grown on the land either in the form in which it is grown or in the form in which it is converted for the purpose of transportation or preventing deterioration is within the exception provided by section In the present case with a view to prevent deterioration and for the purpose of facilitating transportation the assessee converted the sugar cane grown by him into gur and sold it The question in our judgment does not bring out the real matter in dispute between the taxing authorities and the assessee We therefore reframe the question as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the applicant can be regarded as a dealer within the meaning of section of the Bombay Sales Tax Act
