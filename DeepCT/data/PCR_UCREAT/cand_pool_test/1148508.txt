This is a petition under Article of the Constitution impugning the legality of an order dated passed by Mr <NAME> <ORG> Commissioner <ORG> dismissing the petitioner from service under the State of Uttar Pradesh as Supervisor <NAME> The petitioner has filed a long and rambling affidavit containing the entire history of his case from the year when he first got into trouble uptill the date of his dismissal in After looking into the entire record which consisted of several hundreds of foolscap typed pages I feel that it is not necessary for me to consider any of the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner as I am of the opinion that they have no force but I have also come to the conclusion that the order of dismissal is vitiated by failure to comply with the mandatory provisions of Article of the Constitution and must therefore be quashed Without waiting for the result of the appeal the authority concerned passed an order of dismissal against the petitioner on On he was served with a charge sheet in respect of the same offences which were the foundation of the criminal proceedings ending in his acquittal On he was served with a notice to show cause why he should not be dismissed from service He must have been dismissed subsequently for when he filed a writ petition in this Court Writ Petition No of a statement was made on behalf of the Government on that the order of dismissal had been withdrawn On he was served with a second charge sheet accusing him of having used language in his representations which was highly objectionable Quotations from his various representations were included in the charge sheet which is Annexure VIII of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State This was duly followed by a notice asking him to show cause why he should not be dismissed An uptodate copy of the gradation list fin triplicate of supervisor <NAME> in such district after the above confirmations may please be sent to me immediately The petitioner had been charged with certain offences on two occasions On the first he was dismissed but the order of dismissal was withdrawn His representations were considered objectionable and he was again served with a charge sheet It appears that he was given no post even after the passing of the reinstatement order nor was he paid his salary with effect from the date of his dismissal apart from the subsistence allowance which he had been receiving during the period of his suspension On he served a notice on the Governor of the State which bears the title Notice to launch Satyagrah by starting to fast unto death at the western gate of the Government House Lucknow on at A The notice was sent by registered post and was marked Immediate It is not at all surprising that the Government took serious objection to this kind of notice and the petitioner was again in serious trouble Your are warned that if no such statement is received from you by the undersigned within the time allowed it will be presumed that you have none to furnish and orders will be passed in your case accordingly There is no reference whatsoever to the earlier offences accepting illegal gratification and using offensive language which were the subject matter in earlier proceedings against him On the basis of these three offences the Commissioner came to the following conclusion I therefore propose to dismiss <NAME> Unfortunately however this order is also vitiated by the fact that Mr <NAME> took into consideration not only the petitioner misconduct as expounded in the charge sheet dated which alone he was entitled to consider but also the earlier acts of alleged misconduct which find no place in that charge sheet For example in para of his order the Commissioner wrote There is no doubt whatsoever from the evidence which was produced in the criminal trial that he accepted illegal gratification from <NAME> on the strength of recommending his application for supply of wood from the Government Forest There is passing reference to it but of perfunctory nature Thus there has been a clear violation of the mandatory provisions of Article of the Constitution which enjoins that no person shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him If a Government servant is charged with specified acts of misconduct it is not open to the dismissing authority to consider any other acts of misconduct with which he may have been charged in any earlier proceedings which however were subsequently dropped and ended in his unconditional reinstatement If he is punished for these earlier acts which are not included in the latest charge he will be deemed not to have been given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed against him I therefore quash the order of the Commissioner of Rohilkhand Division dated dismissing the petitioner from service It must be clearly understood that the order of dismissal is being quashed on the technical ground that it was passed without complying with the statutory safeguards of Article All these offensive words and phrases were used by the petitioner several years after the partition of India when there was no occasion or excuse for such utterances In the circumstances of this case the parties shall bear their own costs
