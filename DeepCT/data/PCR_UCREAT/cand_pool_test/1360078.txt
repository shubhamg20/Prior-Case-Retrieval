The Special Judge <NAME> went through the charge sheet statements made by the witnesses before the police and other documents and coming to the conclusion that there was no sufficient ground for framing a charge against the respondents discharged them under after giving cogent reasons for passing the order of discharge At the stage of the Judge has merely to sift the evidence in order to find out whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The sufficiency of ground would take within its fold the nature of the evidence recorded by the police or the documents produced before the court which exfacie disclose that there are suspicious circumstances against the accused so as to frame a charge against him What has been acquired is merely the Raiyyati or the lessee interest and as the proprietary interest vests in the <ORG> itself there is no question of either acquiring or claiming compensation for the interest of the <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is directed against the judgment dated th August of <ORG> by which <ORG> has upheld the order of the Special Judge <NAME> discharging respondents No and The facts of the case lie within a narrow compass and centre round an alleged conspiracy said to have been entered into between respondents No and in order to commit offences under sections and of the Prevention of Corruption Act hereinafter referred to as the Act read with section I The main charge against the respondents was that between to the respondent entered into an agreement For the purpose of obtaining pecuniary advantage for respondent No Samal and in pursuance of the said conspiracy the second respondent <NAME> who was the Land Acquisition officer aided and abetted the first respondent in getting a huge sum of money for a land acquired by the Government which in fact belonged to the Government itself and respondent No was a skew thereof The Special Judge <NAME> after having gone through the charge sheet and statements made by the witnesses before the police as also other documents came to the conclusion that there was no sufficient ground for framing a charge against the respondents and he accordingly discharged them under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter called the Code The Special Judge has given cogent reasons for passing the order of discharge The appellant went up to <ORG> in revision against the order of the Special Judge refusing to frame the charge but <ORG> dismissed the revision petition filed by the appellant and maintained the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge Thereafter the appellant moved this Court by ar application for special leave which having been granted to the appellant the appeal is now set for hearing before us The short point which arises for determination in this case is the scope and ambit of an order of discharge to be passed by a Special Judge under section of the Code The appeal does not raise any new question of law and there have been several authorities of <ORG> as also of this <ORG> on the various aspects and grounds on which an accused person can be discharged but as section of the Code is a new section and at the time when the application for special leave was filed there was no direct decision of this <ORG> on the interpretation of section of the Code the matter was thought fit to be given due consideration by this <ORG> We might state to begin with that so far as the present case offences committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act is concerned it is regulated by the procedure laid down by the Criminal Law Amendment Act under which the police has to submit charge sheet directly to the Special Judge and the question of commitment to <ORG> does not arise but the Sessions Judge has nevertheless to follow the procedure prescribed for trial of sessions cases and the consideration governing the interpretation of section of the Code apply mutatis mutandis to these proceedings after the charge sheet is submitted before the Special Judge Under the previous Code of the Magistrate was enjoined to take evidence of the prosecution witnesses after giving opportunity to the accused to cross examine the witnesses nd was then required to hear the parties and to commit the acceded to <ORG> unless he chose to act under section and found that there was no sufficient ground for committing the accused person for trial Thus it would appear that the legislature while dispensing with the procedure for commitment enquiry under the Code of has conferred a dual responsibility on the Trial Judge who has first to examine the case on the basis of the statement of witnesses recorded by the police and the documents filed with a view to find out whether a prima facie case for trial has been made out and then if such a case is made out to proceed to try the same In the instant case as the offences alleged to have been committed by the respondents fall within the provisions of the Act the Special Judge has been substituted for the Sessions Judge the procedure of <ORG> having been applied fully to the trial of such cases Thus it is manifest that the accused has not only one opportunity and that too before the Sessions Judge for showing that no case for trial had been made out Section of the Code runs thus If upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf the Judge considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing The words not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused clearly show that the Judge is not a mere post office to frame the charge at the behest of the prosecution but has to exercise his judicial mind to the facts of the case in order to determine whether a case for trial has been made out by the prosecution At the stage of section the Judge has merely to sift the evidence in order to find out whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The sufficiency of ground would take within its fold the nature of the evidence recorded by the police or the documents produced before the court which ex facie disclose that there are suspicious circumstances against the accused so as to frame a charge against him But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the <ORG> to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the <ORG> to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused But it is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the <ORG> should proceed with the trial or not If the evidence which the Prosecutor pro poses to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross examination or rebut ted by the defence evidence if any cannot show that the accused committed the offence then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial This Court has thus held that whereas strong suspicion may not take the place of the proof at the trial stage yet it may be sufficient for the satisfaction of ths Sessions Judge in order to frame a charge against the accused Even under the Code of this Court has held that a committing Magistrate had ample powers to weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a case of commitment to the Sessions Judge has been made out He is entitled to sift and weigh the materials on record but only for seeing whether there is sufficient evidence for commitment and not whether there is sufficient evidence for conviction If there is no prima facie evidence or the evidence is totally unworthy of credit it is the duty to discharge the accused if there is some evidence on which a conviction may reasonably be based he must commit the case Thus on a consideration of the authorities mentioned above the following principles emerge That the Judge while considering the question of framing the charges under section of the Code has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out Where the materials placed before the <ORG> disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly explained the <ORG> will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial We shall now apply the principles enunciated above to the present case in order to find out whether or not the courts below were legally justified in discharging the respondents When respondent No came to know that the land in question was required by <ORG> authorities he wrote a letter to Mr We have mentioned this fact because this forms the very pivot of the case of the appellant in order to assail the judgment of the courts below A copy of the original agreement which also has been filed shows that under the terms of the lease the same is entitled to be renewed automatically at the option of the lessee and unless the lessee violates the conditions of the lease there is no possibility of the lease being resumed As it is the lease had been continuing from the year and there was no possibility or its not being renewed on when the period expired There was no question of any concealment or malpractice committed by respondent No Another important circumstance relied on by the appellant was the great rapidity with which the land acquisition proceedings started and ended clearly shows that the respondents had joined hands to get the lands acquired and the compensation paid to respondent No In this connection reliance was placed on the fact that the copies of the records of rights were prepared on th March in which the land was no doubt shown as having been owned by the <ORG> It would however appear that once notices under section and of the Land Acquisition Act were issued and the objection filed by the appellant was withdrawn because there was no one else in the field there was no impediment in the way of acquiring the land and taking possession from respondent No These facts apart from negativing the allegations of criminal conduct against the respondents demonstrably prove the untruth of the circumstance relied upon in the charge sheet namely that unless the respondent No and acted in concert and conspiracy with each other respondent No could not have known the exact figure of the compensation to be awarded to him In this connection reliance was placed on a letter written by respondent No to the <ORG> officer <NAME> on th March where he had mentioned that as <NAME> of the <ORG> he would be getting a compensation of Rs as only the Raiyyati or the lessee interest was proposed to be acquired and this letter was sent to the <ORG> for sanction and the estimate was sanctioned on It was contended that no notice was given to the <ORG> department so that the <ORG> could claim compensation of the proprietary interest It is obvious that what has been acquired in the present case is merely the Raiyyati or the lessee interest and as the proprietary interest vests in the <ORG> itself there is no question of either acquiring or claiming compensation for the interest of the <ORG> this Court observed as follows If the <ORG> has itself an interest in the land it has only to acquire the other interests outstanding therein so that it might be in a position to pass it on absolutely for public user When <ORG> possesses an interest in land which is the subject of acquisition under the Act that interest is itself outside such acquisition because there can be no question of <ORG> acquiring what is its own Finally it was argued that what was acquired by the <ORG> was merely the lessee interest but the respondent No appears to have got compensation as the owner We have already referred to the circumstances which clearly show that the <ORG> was fully aware that it was only the lessee interest which was being acquired and even the fresh estimate for Rs which was sent to the <ORG> was shown as representing the Raiyyati interest For these reasons therefore we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by <ORG> that there was no sufficient ground for trying the accused in the instant case
