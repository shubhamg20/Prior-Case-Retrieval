This appeal has been filed by <ORG> against the order of <ORG> awarding a sum of Rs as compensation to the first respondent herein in respect of an accident resulting in the death of the first respondent husband one <NAME> that took place on th June when he was hit by a lorry owned by the second respondent and driven by one <NAME> The first respondent who is the wife of the deceased <NAME> filed an application claiming a compensation of Rs before <ORG> under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act in respect of the accident that took place at A on th June on the ground that the lorry belonging to the second respondent and driven by its driver in a careless and negligent manner hit the deceased who was standing near the bus stop resulting an the death of the deceased on the spot and that as a result of the death the petitioner had lost her husband and also incurred monetary loss After analysing the evidence adduced by the parties the <ORG> took the view that the accident was entirely due to the rash and negligent driving of the lorry by and that there is no evidence to show that the deceased used to get fits often that while crossing the road in a careless manner he suddenly swooned and fell under the right rear wheel of the lorry that the sketch Exhibit A prepared by the Inspector of Police within whose jurisdiction the place of occurrence is situate showed that the dead body was lying feet north of the place where the lorry came to a halt after the impact that it showed the lorry driver should have driven the lorry on the wrong side of the road instead of keeping to the left and that from this it was clear that he was driving the lorry in a rash and negligent manner when he hit and caused the death of the deceased The <ORG> has also relied on the evidence of the eye witness who says that the deceased and one <NAME> were waiting for the bus on the eastern side to go to Trichy and as there was no room in the bus they crossed and came to the mud portion of the road with a view to take tea in his tea shop that while were they walking in the mud portion towards his tea shop the lorry came from north at a high speed in the wrong side and its front bumper hit <NAME> and threw him away that <NAME> fell on the road facing down and the front right wheel run over his legs that the lorry came to a stop after running a distance of feet from the deceased and that the deceased died on the spot As regards the quantum of compensation the <ORG> found that the petitioner is a young girl aged years and the deceased was aged years at the time of his death that the deceased would have lived for another years if he had not met with the accident that the deceased was hale and healthy at the time of his death that as per the evidence of in whose shop the deceased was working he was getting a daily wage of Rs The owner of the lorry has not filed an appeal and the insurance company has alone filed this appeal challenging the said award of compensation Therefore there are enough materials to support the finding of the <ORG> that the accident was due to rash and negligent driving of the lorry by its driver and that it was not due to the deceased fault in crossing the road carelessly and swooning and falling down on the right rear wheel of the vehicle as spoken to by the lorry driver Section of the Motor Vehicles Act says that if judgment in respect of any liability under a certificate of insurance under Section is obtained against any person insured by the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of that section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability Sub section to Section however says that no sum shall be payable under Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice of the proceedings through the <ORG> and the insurer to whom notice of the proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the grounds set out in Clauses a and thereunder Section A dealing with the procedure and powers of the <ORG> says that where in the course of any enquiry the <ORG> is satisfied that there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made or the person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest the claim the <ORG> may direct the insurer to be impleaded as a party to the proceedings and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have the right to contest the claim on all or any of grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made A conjoint reading of both the Sections and A indicates that it is only when there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made or the person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest the claim the insurance company is enabled to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made and not in every case where the insurance company has been impleaded However it has been held in that case that the insurer has the right to defend the action on all grounds that are open to the insured provided he has reserved that right by the terms of the policy and defends the action in the Dame of the assured it has been held that the insurance company was not entitled to appeal against the quantum of compensation in view of the clear terms of Section and that an appeal against the order of the <ORG> by the insurance company which he could not contest before the Motor Accidents <ORG> was not competent In <NAME> <NAME> a Division Bench held that Section of the Motor Vehicles Act makes it clear that in the application for damages under the Motor Vehicles Act an insurance company need not be made a party by the claimant but under Sub section it is the duty of the Court to issue a notice of the proceedings to the insurance company and on such notice being issued the insurer in entitled to be made a party and defend the action only on the ground that the policy stood cancelled on the grounds stated in the sub section and that it is only on those limited grounds that the insurer is entitled to contest the proceedings It was held that it is not open to the insurance company to assail the findings of the <ORG> on merits and that the grounds that can be raised in the appeal by the insurance company can only be those set out in Clauses a to of Sub section of Section The second exception is where the insurance policy itself enables the insurer to defend the action in the name of the insured in respect of the claims arising under the policy The mere fact that the insured has not filed an appeal does not mean that there is collusion between him and the claimant Even assuming that there is such an enabling provision in the policy still the insurer can himself raise all contentions that are open to the insured only if he defends the action in the name of the insured The learned Counsel for the appellans would however submit that the limitation contained in Section as to the defence that are open to the insurance company will apply only to the proceedings before the <ORG> and not before the appellate <ORG> and that once an appeal is filed under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the insurance company is entitled to question the award on all grounds that can be raised by the insured In our view the limitations contained in Section will equally apply to the appeal filed by the insurance company Since the insurance company has not filed the appeal in the name of the insured and as there is no collusion proved between the insured and the claimant the defences that are open to it under Section can alone be canvassed in the appeal There is clear evidence that he was earning a minimum sum of Rs and even taking thirty years as the remaining span of life of the deceased the compensation will easily work out to more than Rs In any view of the matter the appeal has to be dismissed and it is dismissed accordingly with costs of the first respondent For the reasons stated in the main judgment in A No of this petition is dismissed
