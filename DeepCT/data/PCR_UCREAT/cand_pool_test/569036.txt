This is an appeal by an employee of <ORG> whose services were dispensed with and he filed a suit from which this appeal arises contending that the order discharging him was not a valid order and that he continued to be in service of the <ORG> In January he was transferred to Bombay and he served in the office of the Controller of Naval Accounts It is this order which is being challenged by the appellant In his evidence also he has referred to his expectation that he would be confirmed in his post in or about the year and he has admitted that during the course of his service he did not receive any order or letter from the department confirming him or making him permanent What is urged is that the appellant was dismissed from service without any reasonable opportunity being given to him to show cause against the charge that was levelled against him that he was permanently incapacitated That was a case of a permanent Government servant who was asked to retire compulsorily and his grievance was that that constituted removal and he had a right to the constitutional safeguards under Article At of the judgment <NAME> as he then was observes Removal like dismissal no doubt brings about a termination of service but every termination of service does not amount to dismissal of removal And this is how the learned Judge poses the question The question then is whether a tennination of service brought about by compulsory retirement is tantamount to dismissal or removal from service so as to attract the provisions of Article of the Constitution There is considerable force in Mr <NAME> contention because if Government does not choose to dispense with the services of a temporary servant under its contract with him but wishes to inflict a punishment upon him and wishes to dismiss him or remove him then it may be said that his case would stand on the same footing as the case of a permanent servant that he is being punished by the <ORG> which may result in serious consequences and such punishment should not be inflicted unless he is afforded the safeguard provided by Article If a <ORG> servant is made permanent or is confirmed in his post the tenure of his service would be regulated by the rules framed in that behalf and his services cannot be terminated before that period What has got to be borne in mind is that it is only in cases falling within Article or Section that the <ORG> as an employer is bound to conform to certain rules of natural justice indicated in that Article and that section It cannot be disputed that if the <ORG> had discharged the appellant without giving any reasons at all that order could not have been challenged by the appellant because the appellant being a temporary servant he had no security of tenure he could not claim to continue in <ORG> service for any length of time and the <ORG> like any other employer would be entitled to dispense with his services at any time it thought proper It is true that we must look at the substance of the matter and we should not be influenced by the language used in the order Therefore as good a certificate of character as is possible was given to the appellant It is an order which discharged him it is an order which could have been passed without giving any reasons The reasons having been given we have a right to scrutinize those reasons and even when we scrutinize those reasons the reasons do not suggest that <ORG> looked upon the conduct of the appellant as unworthy conduct for which he was being punished by being asked to leave the service of <ORG> It was argued that the order in question is based upon a medical certificate which is issued under Article a of the rules framed by <ORG> which article refers to a form of medical certificate to be given respecting an officer applying for pension in India and it is said that this certificate has not been properly issued because the appellant case is not covered by the rules Assuming the article has no application and assuming the certificate was issued in a form which was not applicable the certificate contains certain facts and materials and the Government has based its order of discharge on those facts and materials Nor is it open to the employee to say that he should be given an opportunity to controvert the accuracy of the materials on which the employer came to a particular conclusion It was then urged by Mr <NAME> that there are certain rules framed which form annexure to Rules to of Office Manual Part I of <ORG> Edition which deal with cases of removal of a servant for physical incapacity and Mr <NAME> says that the respondents should have dispensed with the services of the appellant after complying with these rules But when we have come to the conclusion that the order challenged is not an order which falls in this category then ex hypothesi these particular rules can have no application A rather ingenious argument was put forward by Mr <NAME> that <ORG> has failed to point out any rule under which the Appellant was discharged and according to Mr <NAME> whenever there is a case of a temporary servant whose services are dispensed with either without notice or with notice the case must fall under a particular rule which In other words according to Mr <NAME> in the absence of any rule <ORG> has no power to dispense with the services of a temporary servant The law governing the relationship between an employee and an employer must apply equally to a case of an employee whose employer happens to be the <ORG> or the <ORG> unless there is something in law or in the Constitution which has made a departure from that rule But when Government dispenses with the services of a temporary servant it is not for Government to justify that order by referring to any specific rule but it is for the discharged servant to point out that there is something in the Constitution or in any provision of the law which constitutes a departure from the principles of common law There is no doubt that under common law Government could have dispensed with the services of the appellant and at most it would have been compelled to pay salary for reasonable notice which it was bound to give But apart from that there is no restriction on the right of the employer to dispense with the services of his employee In most cases there is a written contract when Government employs a temporary servant or there are rules which govern the employment of temporary servants We have a case here where there seems to be neither a written contract nor a rule and in the absence of one or the other we must fall back upon principles of common law and we cannot possibly take the view that Government was not entitled in law to dispense with the services of a temporary servant There is no doubt that when an authority is constituted a domestic <ORG> and has got to hold an inquiry into the conduct of a person it must observe the rules of natural justice The <ORG> would only be a domestic <ORG> if it was inquiring and investigating into any charge levelled against the appellant There is not a case where any inquiry has to be held against the appellant and therefore neither the question of a domestic <ORG> nor the question of the rules of natural justice can arise In this case In the circumstances we agree with the view taken by the learned trial Judge that the plaintiff suit was not well founded Mr <NAME> has drawn our attention to the fact that the doctor who examined the appellant for his eye sight has made an observation in his report that with such a high Myopia and lenticular opacities in my opinion he should be categorised permanent and given proper job to do
