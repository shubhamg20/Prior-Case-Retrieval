continue the firm and they shall make full payment to the retiring partners of such amounts in such manner and on such conditions as shall be decided upon by the arbitrator The arbitrator gave the award The respondents applied for an order setting aside the award on diverse grounds two out of which survived for consideration in the present appeal The first was that the arbitrator in making this award exceeded his jurisdiction because in fixing Rs Held i An award made by an arbitrator is conclusive as a judgment between the parties and the court is entitled to set aside an award if the arbitrator has misconducted himself in the proceeding or when the award has been made after the issue of an order by the <ORG> superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid under of the Arbitration Act or where an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid under of the Act An award may be set aside by the <ORG> on the ground of error on the face of the award but an award is not invalid merely because by a process of inference and argument it may be demonstrated that the arbitrator has committed some mistake in arriving at his conclusion ii It is not open to the <ORG> to speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusions The award must therefore fail in its entirety ii In the present case the arbitrator in working out net profits for four years took into account depreciation of immovable SCI property For this reason he must be held to have exceeded his jurisdiction and it is not a question of his having merely interpreted the partnership agreement for himself as to which the Civil <ORG> could have had no say unless there was an error of law on the face of the award <NAME> <ORG> a firm consisting originally of four partners <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> has been doing business of manufacturing bidis at Sagar and Delhi since Pursuant to this modified agreement <NAME> entered upon the reference and made his award on January <NAME> and his sons then applied for an order setting aside the award on diverse grounds That the arbitrator was guilty of legal misconduct in that he had in the course of arbitration proceedings admitted in his record a statement of account prepared by <NAME> and his sons without the knowledge of the other partners and without giving them an opportunity to make their submissions thereto He had in determining the amounts due to the retiring partners to take final accounts with regard to the matters set out in cl as far as possible according to and taking into consideration the terms and conditions of the Partnership agreement The language used in the deed of reference is of compulsion not of option it means that if there be in the partnership agreement any term or condition which deals with any particular matter of which an account was to be taken under cl of the agreement of reference it has to be strictly followed We may now turn to the award made by the arbitrator Counsel for the appellant submitted that reduction of outstandings of the firm by in respect of the dues from persons other than the partners was a mode of ascertaining the depreciation in respect of that item provided by cl of paragraph of the partnership agreement and the arbitrator in taking into consideration that depreciation has not acted outside his jurisdiction The arbitrator had no power to make any adjustment in respect of those items by including depreciation or appreciation in their value The principle of Cruikshank and others <NAME> and others on which reliance was placed by counsel for the retiring partners has in our judgment no application to this case because in that case though there was an article of the partnership providing that the share of a deceased partner in the assets of the partnership should be ascertained by reference to the annual account made up on April next after the death the articles were wholly silent as to the Ch principle to be adopted in preparing a full and general account of the property There was no usage or course of dealings between the partners from which an inference could be drawn that on the death of a partner his share shall be paid out on the footing of book value Even if there were a usage to state an account for one purpose in one way that is not a usage to state it for another purpose in the same way In the case before us there is no dispute that the duty of the arbitrator was to make valuation of the firm subject to paragraph of the partnership agreement and it may even be granted that in arriving at that valuation he was not bound by paragraph but on this question we express no opinion Adoption of the book value is therefore obligatory and there is no scope It was then urged that it was for the arbitrator to adjudicate upon the true meaning of the partnership agreement and to give effect thereto and if in making a valuation of the firm he was of the opinion that depreciation and appreciation in respect of certain items of assets should be included for the purpose of making up the account of the partners the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to set aside the award on that account merely because the <ORG> took a different view as to the true meaning of the arbitration agreement By assuming that he was entitled to include beside the value of the four items as mentioned in paragraph some amount by way of appreciation in the value of those items the arbitrator purported to set at naught the specific directions given in that behalf An award made by an arbitrator is conclusive as a judgment between the parties and the <ORG> is entitled to set aside an award if the arbitrator has misconducted himself in the proceedings or when the award has been made after the issue of an order by the <ORG> superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid under of the Arbitration Act or where an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid of the Arbitration Act An award may be set aside by the <ORG> on the ground of error on the face of the award but an award is not invalid merely because by a process of inference and argument it may be demonstrated that the arbitrator has com mitted some mistake in arriving at his conclusion The <ORG> in dealing with an application to set aside an award has not to consider whether the view of the arbitrator on the evidence is justified It is not open to the <ORG> to speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion On the assump tion that the arbitrator must have arrived at his conclusion by a certain process of reasoning the <ORG> cannot proceed to determine whether the conclusion is right or wrong But the arbitrator has in the present case expressly stated in his award that in arriving at his valuation he has included the depreciation and appreciation of the property outstandings and dead stock and in so doing in our judgment the arbitrator has travelled outside his jurisdiction and the award is on that account liable to be set aside In fact under the scheme of valuation envisaged by the partnership agreement and therefore the deed of reference there was no scope for including in the valuation appreciation of the assets It was also urged that the expression depreciation and appreciation had no such meaning as decrease or increase in the market value of the property dead stock and outstandings and the clause merely meant that in fixing the valuation such depreciation or appreciation as had gone into the assessment of the book value of the different items was taken into consideration But the arbitrator has not said that he merely took into consideration the depreciation and appreciation which went into the book value assigned by the partners to the assets in the account he has clearly stated that he had included the depreciation and appreciation in those assets in the valuation of the goodwill The orders passed by the arbitrator in exercise of these powers tend to indicate that in his view he was competent to ascertain and include in the valuation of the firm the depreciation and appreciation on the various items which were taken into account in arriving at the valuation In the note to the order it was stated that <NAME> had produced certain papers but they were incomplete and therefore he was ordered to bring copies of the incomplete papers and also those papers which were not sent by him It was submitted by that application that the kind of inspection claimed and granted amounted to re opening of the accounts for the last five years which were closed with the consent and to the knowledge of all the partners and which could not in law be re opened On these applications on December the arbitrator gave a direction that <NAME> do produce the papers mentioned in item No in the order dated September namely the gross and net profits of the last five years and that he do produce the other papers which were ordered to be produced by the order dated September The award must therefore fail in its entirety The judgment of the Additional District Judge was confirmed on appeal by <ORG> and the present appeal has been filed on a certificate granted by <ORG> under Art The arbitration proceedings were necessary because of the retirement of the appellants from a firm called <ORG> which at that time consisted of eight partners in three groups In revoking the award <ORG> in concurrence with the court below has upheld two objections a that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction and that he was guilty of misconduct in receiving some evidence behind the back of <NAME> As a result of an arrangement reached <NAME> by which the businesses of these partners which were in different firm names and various places were to be divided between the appellants on the one hand and the respondents on the other the parties desired an arbitration to separate the shares of the appellants as partners retiring from the firm <ORG> A deed of reference was executed by them on April paid an amount to be determined by the arbitrator and in such a manner and on such conditions as he might direct The arbitrator having filed the award in <ORG> the respondents filed objections only two of which noticed above succeeded and the award was set aside The dispute is thus whether the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by adding back depreciation amounts to the book value and or allowing for appreciation of property which was successfully claimed by the respondents in <ORG> and the <ORG> below to be not open to him In this appeal it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the deed of partnership as well as the order of reference left the arbitrator a free hand and even if the arbitrator wrongly interpreted the deed of partnership and did add back the depreciation and or appreciation no question of jurisdiction could arise This is the only way in which the excess of jurisdiction can be found If the interpretation of the deed of partnership lies with the arbitrator then there is no question of sitting in appeal over his interpretation in view of the passage quoted above from <NAME> case but if the parties set limits to action by the arbitrator then the arbitrator had to follow the limits set for him and the court can find that he has exceeded his jurisdiction on proof of such action The arbitrator derived his authority from the reference and we must turn to its terms in the first instance For this reason he must be held to have exceeded his jurisdiction and it is not a question of his having merely interpreted the partnership agreement for himself as to which <ORG> on authority could have had no say unless there was an error of law on the face of the award Reliance is placed upon the case of <NAME> and others <NAME> and others that if accounts in the past were not prepared to meet the contingency of retiring partners the accounts must be recast for this special purpose and the arbitrator must necessarily have freedom to value property in his own way and not by accepting old accounts already made by the partners There was thus no option to go to fair value or market price at all The contention of the appellants on the question of juris diction decided against them must fail and I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs
