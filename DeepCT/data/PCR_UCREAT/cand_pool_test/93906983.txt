He was dismissed from service after a domestic inquiry on November on proof of misconduct On the basis of the evidence adduced before <ORG> it came to the conclusion that the punishment imposed was justified as the misconduct Appellant then filed a writ petition before <ORG> which was dismissed by <ORG> The only point involved for decision is apparently concluded by the decision of the <ORG> Bench in <NAME> Vs <ORG> <ORG> Calcutta SCR This point arose directly before <ORG> and such a contention was rejected making a distinction between a case where no domestic inquiry had been held and another in which the inquiry is defective for any reason and <ORG> on its own appraisal of evidence adduced before it reaches the conclusion that the dismissal was justified It was held that in a case where the inquiry was found to be defective by <ORG> and it then came to the conclusion on its own appraisal of evidence adduced before it that the dismissal was justified the order of dismissal made by the employer in a defective inquiry would still relate to the date when that order was made In that decision it was stated thus If the inquiry is defective for any reason <ORG> would also have to consider for itself on the evidence adduced before it whether the dismissal was justified We may now refer to the decision by a three Judge Bench in <ORG> We do not agree that the ratio of <NAME> corroborates the proposition propounded If the <ORG> for the first time passes an order recording a finding of misconduct and thus breathes life into the dead shell of the Management order predating of the nativity does not arise The juris prudential difference between a void order which by a subsequent judicial resuscitation comes into being de novo and an order which may suffer from some defects but is not still born or void and all that is needed in the law to make it good is a subsequent approval by a tribunal which is granted cannot be obfuscated Is this assumption jurisprudentially correct It is significant that the <ORG> decision in <NAME> by which the three Judge Bench was bound is referred in <ORG> and attempt made to indicate that there is no difference in the view taken therein In <ORG> it was held that the defect found in the domestic inquiry is nullified by proof of misconduct on the basis of evidence adduced before <ORG> so that there is no ground available for <ORG> is whether the order of punishment should be set aside on any ground and when <ORG> ultimately reaches the conclusion that even though the inquiry was defective there is material to justify in the punishment awarded it rejects the challenge to the order of punishment which continues to operate Therein also it was held that the award of <ORG> relates back to the date when the order of dismissal was passed by the employer when it found the inquiry to be defective but reaches the conclusion on the evidence adduced before it that the dismissal was justified After referring to <NAME> it was held in <NAME> as under These observations directly cover the case before us because though <ORG> in the instant case found that the inquiry was defective as it infringed the principles of natural justice it come to the conclusion after considering the evidence induced before it that the dismissal was justified Page We may now refer to the juristic principle on which the above quoted observations in <ORG> appears to be based There is a very useful discussion of the topic under the heading Void and Voidable at pages to in Administrative Law by <NAME> Seventh Edition The gist of the discussion in <NAME> is as under Here also there is a logical difficulty since unless an order of the court is obtained there is no means of establishing the nullity of the list If this principle of legal relativity is borne in mind confusion over void of voidable can be avoided For these reasons we are bound to follow the <ORG> decision in Kalyani which is the binding authority on the point We may now refer to later decisions of this Court in <NAME> Vs <ORG> Lucknow Anr In <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were followed by a two judge Bench and similar view taken that the order of dismissal takes effect from the date on which it was originally passed and not from the date of <ORG> when <ORG> after holding the domestic inquiry to be defective reaches the conclusion on the evidence adduced before it that the punishment awarded was justified As a result of the aforesaid decision it must be held that the only point involved for decision in the appeal is concluded against the appellant by the <ORG> decision of this Court in Kalyani and the observations to the contrary in <ORG> are therefore per incurium and not binding
