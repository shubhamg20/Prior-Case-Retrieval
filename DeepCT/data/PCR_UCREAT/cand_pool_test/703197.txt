of the Constitution on the ground that substantial questions of law are involved in the case The appellant filed an appeal to the Tribunal constituted under the Abolition Act and the appeal was dismissed The appellant thereafter filed a suit in the court of the Subordinate Judge Ongole in Guntur District for a declaration that the Shrotriem of East Thakkellapadu was not an estate within the Rent Reduction Act which was the basis on which the impugned notification of <ORG> dated May had been issued nor an inam estate within the Abolition Act which was the decision of the Settlement Officer and of the <ORG> whose legality was challenged and for an injunction restraining the State from taking action in pursuance of these two enactments as regards the lands of the appellant in the said Shrotriem As would be seen from this short narration the two principal questions that would arise for consideration in the appeal would be first whether the Shrotriem village is not an estate within the Rent reduction Act second whether it is not an inam estate under the Abolition Act Its second Section empowers <ORG> to appoint a special officer for any estate or estates for the purpose of recommending fair and equitable rates of rent for the ryoti lands in such estate or estates The <ORG> thereafter considers the report of the officer and publishes in the official <ORG> a notification determining the rates of rent which should prevail in particular estates and of the Rent Reduction Act renders the rates so notified final and binding on the parties In the case before us the above procedure was followed and the State Government published a notification on May under of the Rent Reduction Act determining the rates of rent payable by ryots in the Shrotriem of East Thakkellapadu treating it as an estate The Rent Reduction Act as it stood at the date relevant to these proceedings contained no provision or procedure for the purpose of conducting an inquiry as to whether any village or villages or other property for which the rates of rent were to be determined by the special officer appointed by government was or was not an estate It is therefore manifest that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to issue the notification appointing a special officer as well as the validity of the further proceedings of such officer in the matter of determining the fair and equitable rent payable by the ryots in those villages and the issue by <ORG> of the notification under of the Rent Reduction Act would depend on whether the property in respect of which these proceedings were taken was an estate as defined in of the Madras Estates Land Act In this Act unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context This sub section is followed by Explanations of which only the first is relevant for the purposes of the present appeal and that runs Explanation Where a grant as inam is expressed to be of a named village the area which forms the subject matter of the grant shall be deemed to be an estate notwithstanding that it did not include certain lands in the village of that name which have already been granted on service or other tenure or been reserved for communal purpose The contention urged by the appellant in the Courts below and before us was that the Shrotriem did not fall within this definition for the following reasons which are not wholly separate but some of which run into one another That the grant was not of a named village and so the opening words of the first explanation were not attracted to the case That there was no proof that some of the leads forming part of the village which were the subject grants in inam to others had been granted at a date earlier than the Shrotriem grant to the appellant ancestors and that in consequence the terms of the second limb of the explanation were not attracted and Lastly that the lands not granted to the inamdar were reserved by the grantor but that the reservation was not for communal purposes and that therefore the concluding portion of the explanation became inapplicable We shall now set out the details of the Poramboke of in local measure corresponding to acres on which reliance is placed by learned Counsel for the appellant both for his submission that it was not the entire village that was granted but only certain lands in the village as also that there was a reservation of certain lands by the grantor In this connection reliance is also placed on the entry in column No where there is a reference to two minor inams covered by separate title deeds certified copies of the relative Inam Fair Registers being Exs We shall now take up the points urged by learned Counsel Learned Counsel drew our attention to the heading in the Register of Inams in the village Ex Learned Counsel next referred us to the deduction of the two minor inams of an extent of in local measure about acres covered by Exs It is also stated that jodi was payable by them to the Shrotriemdars and it goes on to say that this might have been imposed by the shrotriemdars themselves We consider therefore that there is no substance in this last contention either The plaintiff the appellants predecessor filed an appeal to the <ORG> constituted under of the Abolition Act on whom appellate powers were conferred by the Act and the appeal was dismissed on June Thereupon the plaintiff filed a writ petition in <ORG> asserting that the shrotriem was not an inam estate and that the orders of the Settlement Officer and the <ORG> holding that it was so were vitiated by error and were even otherwise illegal The first was on what might be termed the merits of the case that the shrotriem was not an inam estate within the definition of that term in the Abolition Act for the reason that the original grant in inam was of both the warams and that consequently it was not an estate within the meaning of of the Estates Land Act as it stood before its amendment in Second he asserted that the decision of the <ORG> dismissing his appeal from the order of the Settlement Officer was not a valid dismissal since that order was passed by only two members whereas the appellate <ORG> constituted by the Abolition Act was one consisting of members When the matter was taken up on appeal to <ORG> the learned Judge arrived at the same conclusion as the trial Judge on the nd point viz Besides they held that on a construction of the provisions of the Abolition Act the jurisdiction to decide the question as to whether or not the shrotriem was an inam estate was exclusively that of the Settlement Officer and of the <ORG> on appeal and that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to determine it On this finding they dismissed the appeal It was submitted to us on behalf of the appellant that the learned Judges of <ORG> were in error in holding that the jurisdiction of <ORG> to determine his complaint that the shrotriem was not an inam estate was barred by the provisions of the Abolition Act Besides it was pointed out that the judgment of the trial Judge who held on the merits on a consideration of the evidence adduced by the appellant that the shrotriem was an inam estate was extremely unsatisfactory and that the learned Judges hearing the appeal should have set aside that judgment and either decided the matter themselves or remanded it for further investigation by <ORG> We agree that the judgment of the learned trial Judge on this point about the shrotriem being an inam estate is not very satisfactory and that if <ORG> had jurisdiction to decide the matter one of the two courses suggested by learned counsel should have been followed by <ORG> We are however of the opinion that the learned Judges were right in their view that the jurisdiction of <ORG> was barred by reason of the provisions of the Abolition Act to which we shall make reference Section of the Civil Procedure Code enacts omitting the explanation which is not material The Courts shall subject to the provisions herein contained have jurisdiction to try all suits of the civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred There is no doubt that a suit to declare that the shrotriem of which the plaintiff is the owner or proprietor does not fall within a particular tenure which would bring it within the operation of laws which greatly curtail his rights therein or thereto is a suit of a civil nature It is true there is no provision in the Abolition Act in terms debarring the civil <ORG> from entertaining suits of this nature or trying them Section contains the definition of the expressions used in the Act and of these we need refer only to the definition of estate the main term used in the Act to indicate the tenure of holding that is being abolished and converted into Ryotwari Before holding the inquiry the Settlement Officer shall cause to be published in the village in the prescribed manner a notice requiring all persons claiming an interest in any land in the village to file before him statements bearing on the question whether the village is an inam estate or not The Settlement Officer shall then hear the parties and afford to them a reasonable opportunity of adducing all such evidence either oral or documentary as they may desire to examine all such documents as he has reason to believe are in the possession of the <ORG> and have a bearing on the question before him and give his decision in writing Every decision of the <ORG> and subject to such decision every decision of the Settlement Officer under this Section shall be binding on all persons claiming an interest in any land in the village notwithstanding that any such person has not preferred any application or filed any statement or adduced any evidence or appeared or participated in the proceedings before the Settlement Officer or the <ORG> as the case may be Let us take a case where from the determination or decision of a Settlement Officer an aggrieved party invokes the appellate jurisdiction of the <ORG> and the latter renders a decision In such a situation there is an express bar to the jurisdiction of <ORG> to adjudicate upon the question whether any inam village is an inam estate or not It was urged that there was no bar where the matter rested merely with the decision of a Settlement Officer and support was sought for this contention from the circumstance that in terms imparted finality solely to the orders of the <ORG> and this could not be read so as to make the same provision applicable to the orders of the Settlement Officer This apart if the submission of the appellant were correct it would mean that when a Settlement Officer rendered his decision on the matter set out in the aggrieved party had a right either to appeal to the <ORG> within the time prescribed or challenge it by a suit in Civil Court within the period of limitation which might be applicable to such suits under the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act If this were so as there might conceivably be more than one party having a similar interest and raising a similar contention who might all feel aggrieved by the decision of a Settlement Officer it would mean that one party might file a suit while another resorted to the <ORG> by way of appeal In these circumstances we have no hesitation in holding that to the extent of the question stated in Section the jurisdiction of the Settlement Officer and of the <ORG> are exclusive and that <ORG> are barred from trying or retrying the same question Ind App at AIR PC at where after holding that the provisions of the Sea Customs Act setting up a special machinery for the adjudication of the correct duty leviable under the Act barred recourse to <ORG> to question the correctness of the decisions of the Authorities acting under that enactment added It is also well settled that even if jurisdiction is excluded the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure Similarly if an appropriate authority has acted in violation of the fundamental principles or judicial procedure that may also tend to make the proceedings illegal and void and this infirmity may affect the validity of the order passed by the authority in question It is cases of this character where the defect or the infirmity in the order goes to the root of the order and makes it in law invalid and void that these observations may perhaps be invoked in support of the plea that the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction notwithstanding a provision to the contrary contained in the relevant statute It is only necessary to add that no question envisaged by Lord <NAME> or referred to by <NAME> is raised in the appeal before us and it is therefore unnecessary for us to examine in the present appeal either the precise limits of this exception When an inferior court or tribunal or body which has to exercise the power of deciding facts is first established by Act of Parliament the legislature has to consider what powers it will give that tribunal or body It may in effect say that if a certain state of facts exists and is shown to such tribunal or body before it proceeds to do certain things it shall have jurisdiction to do such things but not otherwise But there is another state of things which may exist In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist because the legislature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide without any appeal being given there is no appeal from such exercise of their jurisdiction It is manifest that the answer to the question as to whether any particular case falls under the first or the second of the above categories would depend on the purpose of the statute and its general scheme taken in conjunction with the scope of the enquiry entrusted to the tribunal set up and other relevant factors The first of these questions whether the grant is of an inam village is referred to in itself as some extrinsic fact which must pre exist before the Settlement Officer can embark on the enquiry contemplated by that provision and the Abolition Act as it stood at the date relevant to this appeal makes no provision for this being the subject of enquiry by the Settlement Officer On the terms of the property in question being an inam village is assumed as a fact on the existence of which the competency of the Settlement Officer to determine the matter within his jurisdiction rests and as there are no words in the statute empowering him to decide finally the former he cannot confer jurisdiction on himself by a wrong decision on this preliminary condition to his jurisdiction The correctness of that finding may be questioned in any subsequent legal proceeding in the ordinary courts of the land where the question might arise for decision The aggrieved party will have a right of suit as he would have a good cause of action when proceedings are taken under colour of an Act which does not apply to the facts of the case It was submitted by the appellant that the grant in the present case was of the entire interest in the land and not of the melvaram alone and that such an inam even though it be of an entire village was not brought within the provisions of the Abolition Act So far as the second point was concerned the learned Judges accepted as correct the view of <ORG> in the decision referred to and held that the order of the tribunal dismissing the appellant appeal was a nullity but the learned Judges further held that this would not automatically nullify or vacate the determination and decision of the Settlement Officer under and his finding that the village in suit was an inam estate but that it had the effect merely of leaving the appeal where it stood at the time it was purported to be dismissed by the two members who could not function as the <ORG> In other words the result of applying the rule enunciated by <ORG> was that there were a valid order of the Settlement Officer followed by an appeal which had been filed to the <ORG> but which had not yet been disposed of validly by the <ORG> On this conclusion which is obviously correct the appellant could get no benefit so far as the present suit was concerned by the invalid dismissal of his appeal for invoking the jurisdiction of the civil Court to determine the question whether the inam village was an inam estate though it would be competent to him to further prosecute the appeal if he considered that that would serve his interests As regards the first point that is the case of the appellant on the merits the learned Judges held that the jurisdiction of the civil court was impliedly excluded by the provision in the Abolition Act constituting the Settlement Officer and the <ORG> as the authorities to decide the issue and vesting them with the requisite jurisdiction and providing for the procedure to be followed by them in that regard In this view we intimated to learned Counsel for the appellant that it would not be open to him to invite our attention to the evidence which was led before the Settlement Officer for proving that the original grant was of both the warams and that the Settlement Officer and the Subordinate Judge who tried the suit erred in recording that the shrotriem grant of the village was of the melvaram alone
