The appellant filed two writ petitions and alleged that to the extent to which the Act purported to validate acts done under the earlier Act of it was ultra vires ineffectual and inoperative It was further urged that the three basis of compensation laid down by the Act were inconsistent with the requirements of Art It is a saving and validating provision and it clearly intends to validate action taken under the relevant provisions of the earlier Act which was invalid from the start of the Constitution unlike Art does not use the expression law in force at the time it merely says by authority of law and so if a subsequent law passed by the <ORG> is retrospective in its operation it would satisfy the requirement of Art The <ORG> can pass a law retrospectively validating action taken under a law which was void because it contravened fundamental rights If the <ORG> can by retrospective legislation cure the invalidity of action taken in pursuance of laws which were void for want of legislative competance and can validate such action by appropriate provisions the same power can be equally effectively exercised by the <ORG> for validating actions taken under laws which are void for the reason that they contravened fundamental rights It may be that in some basis may work hardship and conceivably evert basis A or basis may not be as satis factory as it should be but when a party challenges the validity of a statutory provisions like it is necessary that the party must adduce satisfactory and sufficient material before the <ORG> on which it wants the court to hold that the compensation which would be paid under everyone of the three bases under the impugned statutory provisions does not amount to a just equivalent Appeal from the judgment and order dated March of <ORG> in Writ Petition Nos of and of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The principal question which arises in these two appeals is related to the validity of of the Madras Electricity Supply Undertakings Acquisition Act XXIX of hereinafter called the Act That question arises in this way The respondent then paid over to the appellant Rs This decision was based on the ground that the Act was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> inasmuch as there was no entry in any of the three Lists of the Seventh schedule of the Government of India Act relating to compulsory acquisition of any commercial or industrial undertaking Meanwhile the Constitution came into force on the th January and the position of the legislative competence of <ORG> in respect of the compulsory acquisition of commercial or industrial undertakings for public purposes has been materially altered After the decision of this Court was pronounced in the case of <ORG> <ORG> passed the Act and it received the assent of the President on the th October and was published in <ORG> on the th October It is under these circumstances that the appellant filed its writ petition No of on the th April On these grounds the appellant prayed for a writ of Certiorari or any other appropriate writ or order or direction calling for the records relating to Ms Later the appellant filed an other writ petition No of on the st January and it added a prayer that a writ of Mandamus or any other writ or order or direction should be issued directing the respondent to restore possession of the appellant undertaking with all its assets along with <ORG> profits from st September or pay the market value of the said undertaking as on st September and interest thereon per cent Mr Justice <NAME> who beard the two writ petitions rejected the contentions raised by the appellant and dismissed the said petitions In other words the learned Judge took the view that even if the challenge made by the appellant to the validity of was found to be justified in the present writ proceedings he would not be prepared to grant it the relief either of possession or of mesne profits Even so the learned Judge proceeded to examine the several points urged by the appellant in support of its contention that was invalid and rejected them In his opinion the Act was valid and being retrospective in operation validated the actions taken by the respondent under the earlier Act of the Constitution and it is with the certificate thus granted to it under the said Article that the present appeals have been brought to this Court It would be recalled that by this order the respondent obtained possession of the appellant undertaking for the first time under the relevant provisions of the earlier Act The argument is that there is no specific or express provision in the Act which makes the Act retrospective and no even if it is valid is ineffective for the purpose of sustaining the impugned order by which possession of the appellant concern was obtained by the respondent Mr <NAME> further contends that this notification was invalid for two reasons it was invalid because it had been issued under the Provisions of an Act which was void as being beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> and it was void for the additional reason that before it was issued the Constitution of India had come into force and it offended against the provisions of Art It is quite clear that the scheme of the Act was to bring within the purview of its material provisions under takings in respect of which no action bad been taken under the earlier act and those in respect of which action had been so taken Similarly section which gives powers to the respondent to take over any undertaking clearly says that that power can be exercised in respect of any undertaking which had already not been taken over Actions taken under the provisions of the earlier Act are deemed to have been taken under the provisions of the Act and possession taken under the said earlier provisions is deemed to have been taken under the relevant provisions of the Act On the contrary in construing we have to bear in mind the fact that the Act is retrospective in operation and is intended to bring within the scope of its material provisions undertakings of which possession had already been taken Let us then construe and decide whether it serves to validate the impugned notification issued by the respondent on the st September It is a saving and validating provision and it clearly intends to validate actions taken under the relevant provisions of the earlier Act which was invalid from the start The only explanation given by Mr <NAME> on behalf of respondent is that since the earlier Act was in fact on the statute book the legislature may have thought that for the sake of form it may have to be repealed formally and so was enacted We have no doubt that was intended to validate actions taken under the earlier Act and on its fair and reasonable construction it must be held that the intention has been carried out by the legislature by enacting the said section Mr <NAME> then contends that the impugned notification is invalid and inoperative because it contravenes Art Article provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law It is urged that this provision postulates the existence of an antecedent law before a citizen is deprived of his property The notification was issued on the assumption that there was an antecedent law viz If the Act is retrospective in operation and has been enacted for the purpose of retrospectively validating actions taken under the provisions of the earlier Act it must follow by the very retrospective operation of the relevant provisions that at the time when the impugned notification was issued these provisions were in existence provides that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the lime of the commission of the offence the Constitution has clearly indicated that even if a criminal law was enacted by any legislature retrospectively its retrospective operations would be controlled by Art It merely says by authority of law and so if subsequent law passed by the legislature is retrospective in its operation would satisfy the requirement of Art and would validate the impugned notification in the present case Therefore we are not satisfied that Mr <NAME> is right in contending that the impugned notification is invalid for the reason that at the time when it was issued there was no law by whose authority it could be sustained That takes us to the larger issue raised by Mr <NAME> in the present appeals In that case one of the questions which arose for decision was whether the doctrine of eclipse applied to a law which was found to be invalid for the reason that it contravened the fundamental rights and the majority decision held that it did not apply to such a law But the q<ORG>stion as to whether the legislature can retrospectively validate actions taken under a void law did not arise for consideration in <NAME> case Mr <NAME> did not dispute the position that in enacting laws in respect of topics covered by appropriate entries in the relevant Lists of the th Schedule to the Constitution the legislatures would be competent to make the provisions of the laws passed by them retrospective If a law is invalid for the reason that it has been passed by a legislature without legislative competence and action is taken under its provisions the said action can be validated by a subsequent law passed by the same legislature after it is clothed with the necessary legislative power If the legislature can by retrospective legislation cure the invalidity in actions taken in pursuance of laws which were void for want of legislative competence and can validate such action by appropriate provisions it is difficult to see why the same power cannot be equally effectively exercised by the legislature in validating actions taken under law which are void for the reason that they contravened fundamental rights That being so if the legislature can validate actions taken under one class of void legislation there is no reason why it cannot exercise its legislative power to validate actions taken under the other class of void legislation <NAME> contention that where the contravention of fundamental rights is concerned the legislature cannot pass a law retrospectively validate actions taken under a law which was void because it contravened fundamental rights not so unusual or extraordinary a thing that little surprise would be felt if <ORG> had overlooked it and it would take a great deal to persuade me that the legislative power for the purpose has been denied to every <ORG> including the Central or Federal <ORG> in India It is true he added that validation of executive orders or any entry even remotedly analogous to it is not to be found in any of the three lists but I am clear that legislation for that purpose must necessarily be regarded as subsidiary or ancillary to the power of legislating on the particular subjects in respect of which the executive orders may have been issued These amendments had the effect of applying retrospectively the charging sections of the Taxing Act and their validity was impeached The legislative powers conferred upon <ORG> under Articles and read with List I of the Seventh Schedule could obviously be exercised only after the Constitution came into force and no retrospective operation of the Constitution is involved in the conferment of these powers But it is a different thing to say that <ORG> in exercising the powers thus acquired is precluded from making a retrospective law and so the conclusion was that <ORG> was content to make a law imposing a tax on the income of any year prior to the commencement of the Constitution This conclusion also proceeded on the basis that the Power of a legislature to pass a law included a power to pass it retrospectively and so the argument that the impugned Act was ban on the ground that it was retrospective in operation was rejected Therefore there is no doubt about the competence of the <ORG> to enact a law and make it retrospective in operation in regard to topics included within the relevant Schedules of the Constitution That takes us to the last argument raised by Mr <NAME> before us with which we are concerned in the present appeals are those as they stood before the th Constitutional Amendment came into force in so far as they referred to the payment of compensation this <ORG> observed that though entry of List III conferred on the <ORG> the discretionary power of laying down the principles which should govern the determination of the amount to be given to the owner of the property acquired Art it would be open to the <ORG> to enquire whether all the elements which make up the true value of the property acquired have been taken into account in lying down the principles for determining compensation This part of was struck down as invalid because it was hold that in fixing the market value on December as the ceiling on Compensation the legislature had patently ignored the fact that prices of lands had considerably risen after the said date and that tended to show that the compensation awardable under the said provision could not be said to be just equivalent of what the owner would be deprived of In support of this argument Mr <NAME> has also referred us to section A of the Indian Electricity Act No Mr <NAME> suggests that the provisions made in A and the proviso to a A of this Act give a fair picture of what could be regarded as a reasonable compensation that should be paid to the undertakings before they are acquired Before dealing with this argument it is necessary to examine the scheme of which provides for the compensation to be paid to the licensees These respective clauses have reference to the dates on or before which the shares of the undertaking have been issued for instance cl a provides that in the case of shares issued on or before the st March the value of each share shall be reckoned at its average value as arrived at from the quotations for the shares as given in the official list of <ORG> on the th day of each month and where such market was closed on that day the quotations on the next working day during the period of there years commencing on the st April and ending on the st March These clauses refer respectively to the book Value of all completed works in beneficial use pertaining to the undertaking and handed over to the Government less depreciation as specified the book value of all works in progress the book value of all other fixed assets the book value of all other fixed assets the book value of all plant and equipment the book value of all intangible assets to the extent such value has not been written off in the books of the licensee the amount due from consumers as specified in cl vii and any amount paid actually by the licensee in respect of every contract referred to in a iii That in broad outlines is the nature of the three Bases prescribed by section for assessing the compensation to be paid to a licensee In this connection it must be borne in mind that of the Act leaves it to the opinion of the licensee to intimate to the <ORG> in writing which basis of compensation it wants to be adopted and so it is not as if the choice of the basis is left to the <ORG> in every case It may be that in some oases basis may work hardship and conceivably even basis A or basis may not be as satisfactory as it should be but when a party challenges the validity of a statutory provision like it is necessary that the party must adduce satisfactory and sufficient material before the <ORG> on which it wants the <ORG> to hold that the compensation which would be paid under everyone of the three Bases under the inpugned statutory provision does not amount to a just equivalent That is the view taken by the Madras High <ORG> and we see no reason to differ from it Therefore the challenge to the validity of the Act on the ground that its important provisions contained in section offend against Art That being our view we must held that the High <ORG> was right in rejecting both the writ petitions filed by the appellant
