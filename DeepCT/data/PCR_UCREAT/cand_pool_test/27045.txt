This order and the list were challenged in writ petitions before <ORG> on the ground that another list published by <ORG> on June determining backward classes for the purpose of Art it was contended that <ORG> had adopted substantially the same list of backward classes with slight modifications and as the new list also made the reservation in favour of castes and not classes it infringed the guarantee under Art No materials were placed on the record to enable the <ORG> to decide whether the criteria laid down for determining that the list prepared by the <ORG> conformed to the requirements of cf Article guarantees by the first clause a fundamental right of farreaching importance If a question arises whether a law which prima facie infringes a fundamental right is within an exception the validity of that law has to he determined by the courts on materials placed before them By merely asserting that the law was made after full consideration of the relevant evidence and criteria which have a bearing thereon and was within the exception the jurisdiction of the courts to determine whether by makinig the law a fundamental right has been infringed is not excluded In the Telangana area there are two Medical Colleges having in the aggregate seats for entrants to the medical degree course The Validity of the <ORG> orders Nos was challenged on the ground that they infringed the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Arts of the Constitution as originally enacted it was provided that The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion race caste sex place of birth or any of them Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making my special provisions for women and children Article provided that No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them fundamental right guaranteed to the citizens of India by Art by the Constitution First Amendment Act providing that Nothing in this article or in clause of article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Constitution that after considering the replies received from the Chief Secretaries of the various <ORG>s it was resolved that the existing list of backward classes pertaining to Andhra and Telangana areas he scrutinised with a view to selecting from that list those castes or communities which are considered backward on account of the low standard of living education poverty places of habitation inferiority of occupations followed etc that at another meeting it was resolved that the list of backward communities prepared by the Director be rearranged in the order of priority in consultation with the Law Secretary taking into consideration the criteria given by Law Secretary in his note to the <ORG> Sub Committee and that in doing so such of the criteria as capable of being practically possible for consideration may be taken into account and accordingly the Law Secretary and the Director of Social Welfare considered the representations made by certain communities to the Government from time to time and drew up a list of the order of priority as called for by the <ORG> Sub Committee that thereafter the <ORG> Sub Committee made its recommendations which were considered by <ORG> on July and that <ORG> considered the social educational and economic conditions of the backward classes named in the lists submitted to them and dealt with each individual class and deleted certain items or classes in the lists changed the denomination of certain classes for the more premise effectuation of concessions to those classes only who really need them and consolidated the backward classes into one list ruling out the priorities suggested by the Director of Social Welfare in accordance with the opinion of the <ORG> Sub Committee and thereafter published resolution No pursuant to which the rules were amended reserving of the seats for the backward classes mentioned in the list prepared by the <ORG> of the <ORG> On behalf of the petitioners it was contended in <ORG> that <ORG> had adopted the same list of backward classes which was struck down by <ORG> in <NAME> caw with some slight modifications and the new list also having made a reservation in favour of castes and not classes it infringed the guarantee Under Art In order that effect may be given to cl it must a pear that the beneficiaries of the special provision are classes which are backward socially and educationally and they are other than the Sche duled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and that the provision made Though it may be suggested that the wider expression cLasses is used in cl of Art It was urged before <ORG> that expert knowledge of the Director of Social Welfare and of the Law Secretary was brought to bear upon the consideration of the relevant materials in the preparation of the list and they were satisfied that the correct tests were applied in the determination of backward classes and on that account the list should be accepted by <ORG> In fact there is a total absence of any material from which we can say that the <ORG> applied the criteria enunciated by their Lordships of <ORG> in the above referred cases in preparing the list of backward classes We cannot accept the contention of the learned Advocate General that once there is proof that the <ORG> bona fide considered the matter it is sufficient The mere fact that the act is bona fide and that there was total absence of mala fides is not relevant Article guarantees by the first clause a fundamental right of far reaching importance to the public generally The <ORG>s of the country are invested with the power to determine the validity of the law which infringes the fundamental rights of citizens and others and when a question arises whether a law which prima facie infringes a guaranteed fundamental right is within an exception the validity of that law has to be determined by the <ORG>s on materials placed before them By merely asserting that the law was made after full consideration of the relevant evidence and criteria which have a bearing thereon and was within the exception the jurisdiction of the <ORG> has repeatedly observed in the course of their judgment that no materials at all were placed on the record to enable them to decide whether the criteria laid down by this Court for determining that the list prepared by the <ORG> conformed to the requirements of cl of Art But whether in that examination the correct criteria were applied is not a matter on which any assumption could be made especially when the list prepared is exfacie based on castes or communities and in substantially the list which was struck down by <ORG> in <NAME> case Honesty of purpose of those who prepared and published the list was not and is not challenged but the validity of a law which apparently infringes the fundamental rights of citizens cannot be upheld merely because the law maker was satisfied that what he did was right or that he believes that he acted in manner consistent with the constitutional guarantees of the citizen The test of the validity of a law alleged to infringe the fundamental rights of a citizen or any act done in execution of that law lies not in the belief of the maker of the law or of the person executing the law but in the demonstration by evidence and argument before the <ORG> that the guaranteed right is not infringed
