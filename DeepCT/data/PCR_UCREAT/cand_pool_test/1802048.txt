In that document there is a statement that House No in Thatha Muthiappan Street belonging to the said <NAME> that is the grandmother and another house with which nobody in this case is concerned which are in possession and enjoyment of the said <NAME> from the date of the purchase shall be enjoyed by the said <NAME> with power to make gift and sell away The learned Vakils have argued this case with great preciseness and Mr <NAME> Iyer for the appellant does not ask us to say that there is any magic about this document because it is in the nature of a nominal settlement which would excuse it from registration It is said on the other side that this is not a document which purports to create or modify in any way anybody title to immoveable property where the learned Judge says thus Here however the document is not itself one which declares a right in immoveable property in the sense probably intended by Section There declare is placed along with create assign limit or extinguish a right title or interest and these words imply a definite change of legal relation to the property by expression of <NAME> embodied in the document referred to It implies a declaration of <NAME> not a mere statement of fact and thus a deed of partition which causes a change of legal relation to the property divided amongst all the parties to it is a declaration in the intended sense but a letter containing an admission direct or inferential that a partition once took place does not declare a right within the meaning of the section It does in one sense declare a right that is the existence of the right is directly or indirectly stated by the writing but it is not the expression or declaration of <NAME> by which the right is constituted That seems to me to allow that the document is admissible in evidence either as a contract to acknowledge an existing title or perhaps as evidence in the nature of an admission We think that for this <ORG> satisfactorily to deal with the matter we ought to have the opinion of the learned Judge on the force of the evidence as a whole and it may be that considered in the light of documents which we have now held admissible his former opinion as to the rest of the evidence would perhaps require modification and we think that this is a process which ought to be gone through by the <ORG> of the first instance The appellant will have his costs of this appeal and the costs incurred in the <ORG> below will be in the discretion of the Trial Judge
