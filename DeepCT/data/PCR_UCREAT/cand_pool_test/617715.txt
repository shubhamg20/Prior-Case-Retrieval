These four separate appeals under Clause of the Letters Patent raise a common question of law namely whether the learned Single Judge from whose orders the appeals have been preferred was justified in sending for the record and restraining <ORG> from going ahead with the removal proceedings A Board of Officers set up to enquire into the conduct of one Major <NAME> Garrison Engineer of Secunderabad recorded the statements of a large number of persons including those of the four petitioners who happened to be serving as officiating Assistant Garrison Engineers No oral enquiry was held but the explanations furnished by them were considered and the Enquiry Officer submitted his report on the basis of which Government called upon the petitioners to show cause why their services should not be terminated The learned Judge of this <ORG> before whom these petitions came up for hearing came to the conclusion that the provisions of Rule of the Rules Regarding Discipline which correspond to Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules were not complied with that the request of the petitioners for an oral hearing was not acceded to that they were not permitted to cross examine the witnesses on whose evidence the prosecution proposed to rely and in short that they were not afforded a reasonable opportunity of defending themselves A copy of the report submitted by the Enquiry Officer is sent to the Officer whose conduct is under investigation and is required to how cause why he should not be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank In the alternative it is prayed that a writ of prohibition should issue to the appropriate officer restraining him from proceeding further without complying with the statutory and other formalities Two questions at once arise for decision namely Whether an officer conducting a removal proceeding in accordance with the provisions of Art Opinion of Justices Am LR at for if a public servant holds office at the pleasure of the <ORG> it is open to the appointing power to remove him arbitrarily without cause or to remove him for cause or to remove him for such cause as it may think fit or proper or upon such enquiries as it may think fit to make or in the absence of any enquiry whatever If however the Constitution declares as has been declared in Article that no person shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank unless he has been afforded a reasonable opportunity of being heard the question arises whether the officer who conducts a removal proceeding against a public servant who cannot be removed without notice and hearing acts in a ministerial or Judicial capacity It certainly has never been regarded in this State that the officer or body upon whom this power is conferred acts in a purely political administrative or legislative capacity In such cases it is of little consequence what name is given to the power conferred I have not been able to discover any direct authority on this point but I entertain no doubt in my mind that the proceeding would be executive or ministerial in character In Ex Parte Fry All ER I a fireman was charged under the Fire Services Discipline Regulations with disobedience to orders inasmuch as he had failed to carry out a lawful order given to him to clear the fire uniform of an officer attached to the station Lord <NAME> dismissed this application with the following observations It seems to me impossible to say whether a chief officer of a force which is governed by discipline as <ORG> is exercising disciplinary authority over a member of the force that he is acting either judicially or quasi judicially It seems to me that he is no more acting judicially or quasi judicially than a schoolmaster who is exercising disciplinary powers over his pupils <ORG> upheld this order on the ground that as the remedy by way of certiorari which was sought was discretionary in the <ORG> and as the <ORG> had exercised its discretion against the fireman there was no occasion for the appellate <ORG> to interfere It refrained from expressing an opinion as to whether the chief officer of a force who is exercising disciplinary authority is acting in a judicial or a quasi judicial capacity I find myself in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of England As the petitioners have not been able to show that the officers who have had occassion to deal with their cases in the removal proceedings were acting in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity it is obvious that they cannot invoke the aid of the writ of certiorari The rules by which their conditions of service are regulated clearly provide a method for reviewing adverse decisions by administrative appeals Even if a writ of certiorari were to lie in a case of this kind I would be extremely reluctant jto issue one for I am of the opinion that interference with interlocutory orders passed in the course of removal proceedings would be productive of nothing but mischief A notice has now been issued to them to show cause why their services should not be dispensed with One is entitled to presume that if there is substance in the protest the appropriate authority will set aside the proceedings and order a fresh enquiry Indeed it was pointed out by their Lordships of the privy <ORG> in <NAME> case that no action is proposed Within the meaning of Sub section of Section of the Government of India Act which corresponds to Article until a definite conclusion has been come to on the charges and the actual punishment to follow is provisionally determined on A subsidiary point has also been raised namely that two of the petitioners have been reduced in rank without having been afforded an opportunity of showing cause against the action which was proposed to be taken against them In <NAME> <ORG> LPA No of AIR Pimj I gave detailed reasons for holding that a Government servant who is holding a post in an officiating capacity is not within the protection of the law which declares that no person shall be reduced in rank unless he has been afforded a reasonable opportunity of being heard For these reasons I am of the opinion that an officer conducting a removal proceeding under Article of the Constitution is not acting in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity that the orders passed by him cannot be reviewed on certiorari that there has been no breach of Article so far as it is still open to Government to afford the petitioners a reasonable opportunity of defending themselves and that the Enquiring Officer did not act illegally or improperly in ordering the reduction of two of the petitioners without affording them a reasonable opportunity of being heard I would accordingly allow the appeal but having regard to the peculiar circumstances of the case leave the parties to bear their own costs I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice and I agree that these appeals should be allowed and the respondents petitions under Article of the Constitution should be dismissed I however prefer to base my judgment on the ground that in these cases there has been no contravention of the provisions of Article of the Constitution for the reasons given by Hon able the Chief Justice in his Judgment These grounds are sufficient to dispose of these appeals and it appears unnecessary to express any final opinion on the other questions raised before us I am however in entire agreement with Hon ble the Chief Justice that the orders in the present cases were made in the exercise of administrative powers but I feel doubtful if the exercise of administrative powers of this nature necessarily precludes an aggrieved person from seeking redress from this court in a fit and proper case by invoking Article of the Constitution I would therefore also accept these appeals leaving the parties to bear their own costs
