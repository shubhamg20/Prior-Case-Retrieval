EXCISE COMMISSIONER Vs RESPONDENT ISSAC PETER DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH JEEVAN REDDY BENCH JEEVAN REDDY <NAME> <NAME> CITATION SCC JT SCALE ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Leave granted in the SLPs The question is whether there was a failure on the part of the <ORG> in supplying the arrack undertaken by it to supply and whether the licensees are entitled to any rebate remission in the amounts payable by them under the contracts on account of such failure if any Several other matters were allowed following the said decision against which the <ORG> has filed appeals The Kerala Abkari Act of corresponding to AD was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to Import Export Transport Manufacture Sale and possession of intoxicating liquors and of intoxicating drugs in the State Sub section says It shall be lawful for the Government to grant to any person or persons on such conditions and for such period as they may deem fit the exclusive or other privilege i of manufacturing or supplying of wholesale or ii of selling by retail or iii of manufacturing or supplying by wholesale and selling by retail any liquor or intoxicating drugs within any local area on his or their payment to the <ORG> of an amount as rental in consideration of the grant of such privilege Section empowers the <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act Rule prescribes the general conditions applicable to licensees of arrack shops both retail and wholesale Rule prescribes the special conditions applicable to licences for the privilege of vending arrack in independent shops There were no bidders on that day and no auction could take place There is no complaint on that score The respondent has filed a statement showing particulars of licence fee monthly quota additional supplies demanded and supplies for the previous two years for the year as well as for the subsequent year The respondent filed the writ petition in <ORG> even during the currency of the excise year i on May It held that by virtue of the said rule the licensees cannot claim any remission or abatement in the amount payable by them nor can they claim any damages for non supply of additional quantities demanded In the absence of availability of arrack there is no obligation upon the Government to supply the additional quantities demanded There is no complaint by any of the licensees herein that the Government did have supplies and yet it did not supply additional quantities to the licensees There is no further or other obligation upon the Government The auctioning authorities made no promise nor did they give any assurance that whatever quantities were demanded will be issued nor did they hold out any promise or assurance that additional quantities equal to the previous year supplies will be maintained during the excise year The argument of the licensees that inasmuch as they were selling arrack at the rate of Rs to Rs per litre they must be supplied additional arrack in such quantities as to enable them to realise the amounts payable to he Government by them in addition to their expenses and profit is unacceptable for the reason that there is no such statutory obligation cast upon the Government The past conduct coupled with the assurances given by the Minister of Excise and the auctioning authorities obligated the authorities to supply additional quantities at least at the level of the previous year additional supplies The court should mould the relief in such situations to suit the circumstances as has been done by it in similar matters It is therefore not really necessary for our purpose to examine what precisely was the statement made by the Minister for Excise on March or by the auctioning authorities at the time of auction The condition of licence upon which reliance is placed by the appellants appears to be of an ambiguous nature In the face of the said language it is difficult for us to accept the contention that the State is under an obligation to supply all that quantity that is asked for by the licensee or quantities equal to the previous years supply or for that matter equal to the average of previous three year In such a situation it is not possible to say that in addition to the situation contemplated by Rule there are other situations also wherein such rebate remission or adjustment is permissible In such a situation it would not be permissible to say that there was some other condition or term agreed upon or implied between the parties which is not found therein Even otherwise having regard to the context and the object underlying there is no warrant for holding that the words may permit in Rule should be read as shall permit Can the <ORG> force and compel the licensees to lift additional quantities to clear its own stocks Would not the licensees say in such a case that they cannot be forced to lift quantities which they are not able to sell If they cannot be so forced on what parity of reasoning is it claimed that even if there are no supplies with the <ORG> it must somehow supply the additional quantities demanded and if it cannot so supply it is not entitled to demand the monies as per the contract All this demonstrates amply that there is no right in the licensees to compel the <ORG> to supply what all they demand nor has the <ORG> the right to compel the licensees to purchase all that it proposes to sell to them We are of the opinion that in the absence of a statutory right in the licensees to get additional supplies demanded by him there is no basis in law for the claim of remission or rebate There is no grievance on this score If so there is no question of the licensees not being able to observe the requirement of Rule This was done probably with the full knowledge that there is shortage of availability of arrack Otherwise there is no explanation for the said excessive demand three times the previous year demand It is pointed out that the selling price of arrack during that year ranged between Rs and Rs and that they had to sell arrack in such quantity as not only to be able to pay the amount due to the <ORG> but also to meet their establishment and other expenses besides making some profit But as pointed out by the learned Additional Solicitor General this argument breaks down even with respect to the previous year if we take the figures relating to Sultan Battery or even for that matter Kalpetta May be there are some other reasons which impel the licensees to stick on to a particular shop or group of shops May be there are other reasons There is yet another reason which militates against the licensees herein Even according to them there was scarcity of arrack during the months of February and March i towards the end of the previous excise year In any event the only assurance was that the authorities would take steps to ensure additional supplies as in the previous year The Government had placed all their cards on the table if we can use that expression But in law there is no basis upon which they can be relieved of the obligations undertaken by them under the contract It is well known that in such contracts which may be called executory contracts there is always an element of risk Many an unexpected development may occur which may either cause loss to the contractor or result in large profit There is no room for invoking the doctrine of unjust enrichment in such a situation The remedy provided by Article or for that matter suits cannot be resorted to wriggle out of the contractual obligations entered into by the licensees Here all the terms and conditions of contract being contained in the statutory rules prevail No decision has been brought to our notice supporting the said proposition Nor could the learned counsel bring to our notice any decision laying down such a proposition Doctrine of fairness or the duty to act fairly and reasonably is a doctrine developed in the administrative law field to ensure the rule of law and to prevent failure of justice where the action is administrative in nature It may be noted that though the said principle was affirmed no relief was given to the appellant in that case It was a case of non government servant holding a public office on account of which it was held to be a matter within the public law field We are therefore of the opinion that in case of contracts freely entered into with the <ORG> like the present ones there is no room for invoking the doctrine of fairness and reasonableness against one party to the contract <ORG> for the purpose of altering or adding to the terms and conditions of the contract merely because it happens to be the <ORG> In such cases the mutual rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the terms of the contracts which may be statutory in some cases and the laws relating to contracts There is no compulsion on anyone to enter into these contracts It bears repetition to say that the <ORG> does not guarantee profit to the licensees in such contracts Whether they make profit or incur loss is no concern of the <ORG> It is not as if the licensees are going to pay more to the <ORG> in case they make substantial profits We reiterate that what we have said hereinabove is in the context of contracts entered into between the <ORG> and its citizens pursuant to public auction floating of tenders or by negotiation What would be the position in the case of contracts entered into otherwise than by public auction floating of tenders or negotiation we need not express any opinion herein But that case turned on its peculiar facts
