After retirement he brought a suit for a declaration that the order of reversion was void and for recovery of Rs The trial court held that there was no compliance with the provisions of of the Government of India Act granted the declaration but refused the arrears claimed Held that the matter was covered by the observations of this <ORG> in <NAME> case and of the two tests of punishment laid town by this <ORG> namely whether the servant had a right to the rank or whether he had been visited by evil consequences of the kind specified therein the second certainly applied The appellant might or might not have the right to hold the higher post but there could be no doubt that the was visited with evil consequences as a result of the order of reversion The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> <NAME> main question for decision in this appeal on a certificate of fitness granted by the <ORG> at Bombay is whether a public servant who has been officiating in a higher post but has been reverted to his substantive rank as a result of an adverse finding against him in a departmental enquiry for misconduct can be said to have been reduced in rank within the meaning of of the Government of India Act A departmental enquiry was held against him as a result of which he was reverted to his original rank as <NAME> by virtue of the Order of the Government dated August Ex He filed his suit against the <ORG> of Bombay on August for a declaration that the Order of the <ORG> dated August was void inoperative wrongful illegal and ultra vires and for recovery of Rs The learned Civil Judge Senior Division at Belgaum came to the conclusion that the first part of the departmental enquiry held against the plaintiff leading up to the findings against him was free from any defect but that he had no been given the opportunity of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be inflicted upon him a a result of those findings in so far as no show cause notice was given to him nor a copy of the enquire report showing the grounds on which the findings ha been based There was an appeal by the plaintiff in respect of the dismissal of his claim for arrears and cross objections by the <ORG> in respect of that part of the judgment and decree which had granted declaration in favour of the plaintiff If the <ORG> servant has a right to a particular rank then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty for he will then lose the emoluments and privileges of that rank If however he has no right to the particular rank his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his substantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment But the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a lower The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences Thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the Government had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules in truth and reality the Government has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty Tn spite of the use of such innocuous expressions the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely whether the servant bad a right to the post or the rank or whether he ha been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to If the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service or the reversion to his substantive rank must be regarded as a reduction in rank and if the requirements of rules and Art which give protection to Government servant have not been complied with the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the consti tutional right of the servant He may or may not have a right to hold the post or the rank but there is no doubt that he was visited with evil consequences Ordinarily if a public servant has been officiating in a higher rank it cannot be said that he has a substantive right to that higher rank But that cannot by itself be a ground for holding that the second test in <NAME> case namely whether he has been visited with evil consequences can be said to have been satisfied If the logs of the emoluments attaching to the higher rank in which he was officiating was the only consequence of his reversion as a result of the enquiry against him the appellant would have no cause of action the appellant lost his seniority as a Mamlatdar which was his substantive post That being so it was not a simple case of reversion with no evil consequences it had such consequences as would come within the test of punishment as laid down in <NAME> case If the reversion had not been for a period of three years it could not be said that the appellant had been punished within the meaning of the rule laid down in <NAME> case The question then arises whether he is entitled to any relief in respect of his claim for arrears of salary and dearness allowance In the instant case he came to the conclusion that as the plaintiff had claimed the difference between the pay and allowance actually drawn and those to which he would have been entitled but for the wrongful orders the claim was based on tort and therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief In that view of the matter the learned Judge held that adding the period of two months of the statutory notice under of the Code of Civil Procedure given to I A Appeal allowed in part
