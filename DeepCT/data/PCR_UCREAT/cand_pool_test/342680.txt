With a view to removing nation wide shortage of sugar enhancing sugar production and achieving an equitable distribution of the commodity so as to make it available to consumers at reasonable rates the Cane Commissioner in exercise of the powers conferred under clause of the Sugarcane Control Order issued a notification dated th October which directed that no power crusher other than vertical power crushers manufacturing gur or rab from sugarcane grown on their own fields or a Khandsari unit or any agent of such owner in the reserved area of a mill could be worked until December The petitioners who were owners of power crushers of Khandsari units and had taken out regular licences under the Uttar Pradesh Khandsari Sugar Manufacturers Licensing Order assailed the notification which limited the ban to work power crushers for a period of one month and a half i from October There is no rational nexus between the prohibition contained in the Notification preventing the crushers of petitioners from working them and the object sought to be achieved by it The impugned Notification by imposing a prohibition against the working of the power crushers amounts to a partial revocation of the licences granted to the petitioners under clause of the Licensing Order and is therefore violative of clause The action taken in order to protect national interest and distribution of sugar to the entire country on rational basis cannot be said to be an unreasonable restriction There is a marked difference between the quality of Khandsari and that of sugar produced by the mills in their character specification etc In so far as the word vertical used in the Notification is concerned it must be struck down as being violative of Article i Where a citizen complains of the violation of fundamental rights contained in any of sub clauses a to of Article the onus is on the <ORG> to prove or justify that the restraint or restrictions imposed on the fundamental rights under clauses to of the Article are reasonable What are reasonable restrictions would naturally depend on the nature and circumstances of the case the character of the statute the object which it seeks to serve the existing circumstances the extent of the evil sought to be remedied as also the nature of restraint or restriction placed on the rights of the citizen Sometimes even a complete prohibition of the fundamental right to trade may be upheld if the commodity in which the trade is carried on is essential to the life of the community and the said restriction has been imposed for limited period in order to achieve the goal Freezing of stocks of food grains in order to secure equitable distribution and availability on fair prices have been held to be a reasonable restriction iv In determining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce the mere fact that some of the persons engaged in a particular trade may incur loss due to the imposition of restrictions will not render them unreasonable because it is manifest that trade and industry pass through periods of prosperity and adversity on account of economic social or political factors The reason is that such a trade or commerce is subject to rise and fall in prices and other diverse factors and if any measure is taken to strike a just balance between the danger sought to be averted and the temporary deprivation of the right of a citizen to carry on his trade it will have to be upheld as reasonable restriction The Central <ORG> under clause on whom the power is conferred is undoubtedly a very high authority who must be presumed to act in a just and reasonable manner ii There was no question of creating any monopoly to benefit the mills It has not been proved that there is any real distinction between a vertical and a horizontal power crusher Clause contemplates regulation of working of the sugar by two separate methods Where only hours of work per day are to be regulated or fixed and the word period which has nothing to do with the hours to be worked but it refers to another category of regulation namely whether a crusher is to run or not for a particular period of time There was an acute shortage of sugar which was not made available to consumers at reasonable rates and the situation caused serious dissatisfaction among the people JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos and of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Inspired by the objective of removing nation wide shortage of sugar and for the purpose of enhancing sugar production in order to achieve an equitable distribution of the commodity so as to make it available to consumers at reasonable rates and thereby relieving the sugar famine the Cane Commissioner Government of Uttar Pradesh by virtue of a Notification dated th October acting under clause of the Sugarcane Control Order hereinafter referred to as the Control Order directed that no power crusher with certain exceptions of a khandsari unit or any agent of such owner in the reserved area of a mill could be worked until December In order to understand the contentions raised by the parties it may be necessary to analyse the prominent features of the above Notification with reference to the situation it was intended to meet In other words any area which fell outside the reserved area was not affected by the Notification and the power crushers situated in that area could still manufacture Khandsari by the open pan process We have mentioned these essential features of the Notification because the most important argument put forward before us by the counsel for the petitioners has been that it imposes unreasonable restrictions on the right of the petitioners under Art We would however deal with this aspect of the matter when we examine the contentions raised by the counsel for the parties The Attorney General appearing for the Union of India and Mr <NAME> Additional Advocate General appearing for the State of contended that decision to ban the power crushers of the petitioners was taken as a part of a high powered policy to boost the production of sugar which had fallen during the year with the result that in the current year the country faced a great sugar famine We might also mention here that the Notification has since spent its force and in fact was not carried into effect because immediately after it was issued the present writ petitions were filed in this Court and the petitioners obtained stay of the operation of the Notification from this Court The petitioners also insisted that the constitutional and legal questions involved in these cases may be decided even though our decision may be more or less of an academic value This brings us now to the various contentions raised by counsel for the petitioners and the respondents The counsel for the petitioners headed by Mr <NAME> Mr <NAME> and others raised the following constitutional points before us The Notification as also the Control Order under which it was passed are clearly violative of of Art and the restrictions purported to be placed on the right of the petitioners not do contain the quality of reasonableness There is absolutely no rational nexus between the prohibition contained in the Notification preventing the crushers of the petitioners from working them and the object sought to be achieved by it The impugned Notification violative of clause of the Control Order itself inasmuch as the prohibition against the working of the power crushers amounts to partial revocation of the licences of the petitioners granted to them under clause of the Licensing Order The Attorney General and the Additional Advocate General appearing for the Union of India and the State of respectively countered the submissions made by the petitioners on the following grounds An order passed under clause of the Control Order is of a legislative character and therefore the question of the application of the principles of natural justice to it does not arise Similarly the action taken in order to protect national interests and distribution of sugar to the entire country on a rational basis cannot be said to be an unreasonable restriction There is a marked difference between the quality of khandsari and that of sugar produced by the mills in their character specification etc made this position very clear and observed as follows There is undoubtedly a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a legislation But when the enactment on the face of it is found to violate a fundamental right guaranteed under article of the Constitution it must be held to be invalid unless those who support the legislation can bring it within the purview of the exception laid down in clause of the article If the respondents do not place any materials before the Court to establish that the legislation comes within the permissible limits of clause it is surely not for the appellants to prove negatively that the legislation was not reasonable and was not conducive to the welfare of the community We therefore fully agree with the contention advanced by the petitioners that where there is a clear violation of Art This brings us to the main question as to the circumstances under which restriction imposed by the <ORG> can be said to contain the quality of reasonableness For this purpose almost all the decisions of this <ORG> on the subject have been placed before us and it may be necessary to notice those of them which have a close bearing on the point at issue It is manifest that in adopting the social control one of the primary considerations which should weigh with the <ORG> is that as the directive principles contained in the Constitution aim at the establishment of an egalitarian society so as to bring about a welfare state within the frame work of the Constitution these principles also should be kept in mind in judging the question as to whether or not the restrictions are reasonable Sometimes even a complete prohibition of the fundamental right to trade may be upheld if the commodity in which the trade is carried on is essential to the life of the community and the said restriction has been imposed for a limited period in order to achieve the desired goal Finally in determining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce the mere fact that some of the persons engaged in a particular trade may incur loss due to the imposition of restrictions will not render them unreasonable because it is manifest that trade and industry pass through periods of prosperity and adversity on account of economic social or political factors In fact the leading case decided by this <ORG> which may justly be regarded as the locus classicus on the questions as to what are reasonable restrictions is <NAME> case supra where <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed as follows It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness where ever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases It follows that it is the duty of this <ORG> to decide having regard to the aforesaid considerations and such others whether a particular statute satisfies the objective test of reasonableness In these circumstances if price is fixed in this area price all over India is practically fixed and it is not necessary to fix prices separately so far as factories in other States which are said to be mainly deficit are concerned There is therefore in our opinion no discrimination in effect by the fixation of prices in these three regions It will be noticed that even though clause had fixed prices the <ORG> upheld the restrictions because a reasonable margin of profit for the producer was left and did not insist that the producer should be allowed to have full sway in the production of sugar to the maximum capacity possible Similarly in <NAME> <NAME> case supra which was also a case dealing with food grains an order freezing the stocks of the commodity in order to secure its equitable distribution so as to make it available at a fair price to consumers was upheld by the <ORG> with the following observations The clause authorises the Commissioner and various others authorities mentioned therein and such other officers as may be authorised by the Commissioner to frreeze any stock of foodgrains held by a person Nor do we think that the power to freeze the stocks of foodgrains is arbitrary or based on no reasonable basis The most material ratio of this case is that even the freezing of stocks of foodgrains with a view to securing their equitable distribution and availability was held to be a reasonable restriction It is evident that an assessment of either the expediency necessity of a measure in the light of all the facts and circumstances which have a bearings on the subjects of price fixation is essentially a subjectives matter But there is no obligation to have to fix the price in such a way as to ensure reasonable profits to the producer or manufacturer It has also to be remembered that the objective is to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices so that it is the interest of the consumer and not of the producer which is the determining factor in applying any objective tests at any particular time The observations extracted above furnish a complete answer to the contentions raised by the petitioners on contention No Furthermore we would like to reiterate what <NAME> <NAME> observed in that case regarding the history and the manner in which the petitioners rushed to this Court Before closing we would like to mention that the petitioners rushed to this Court too precipitately on the heels of the Price Control Order Thereby they deprived themselves of an opportunity to show that in actual fact the Order causes them irreparable prejudice The result of the amendment is that the <ORG> would not have to justify such action as reasonable at all in a Court of law and no objection could be taken to it on the ground that it is an infringement of the right guaranteed under Article of the Constitution <NAME> case In judging the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the Act one has to bear in mind the directive principles of State policy set forth in Article of the Constitution <NAME> case In the instant case however if the argument of the Attorney General is to be accepted there is no violation of the Directive Principles because the main object sought to be achieved by a temporary suspension of the business of the petitioners is to ensure large scale production of white sugar and to make it available to the consumers at reasonable rates which is an implementation rather than a contravention of the Directive Principles particularly clauses and of Art There are other cases in which this <ORG> has clearly held that in the case of essential commodities like sugar the question of the economic production and distribution thereof must enter the verdict of the <ORG>s in deciding the reasonableness of the restrictions The reason for this view is that such a trade or commerce is subject to rise and fall in prices and other diverse factors which may destroy or prohibit one industry or the other so as to affect the general body of the consumers and if any measure is taken to strike a just balance between the danger sought to be averted and the temporary deprivation of the right of a citizen to carry on his trade it will have to be upheld as a reasonable restriction <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed as follows If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit there is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on business by imposing reasonable restrictions The question of fair price to the consumer with reference to the dominant object and purpose of the legislation claiming equitable distribution and availability at fair price is completely lost sight of if profit and the producer return are kept in the fore front In determining the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce it has to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are alleging loss after the imposition of law will not render the law unreasonable Therefore we do not think that these assertions could prove any inequitable treatment meted out to the Haryana manufacturers of sugar In any case no breach of a mandatory duty which could justify the issue of writ of mandamus was established In the light of the principles enunciated and the decisions discused above we now proceed to examine the facts and circumstances placed before us by <ORG> to prove that the restrictions imposed under the impugned Notification contain the quality of reasonableness and are not violative of Art The main pleas of the State of which have been adopted by <ORG> are to be found in paragraphs to of the counter affidavit filed by the respondents in writ petition Nos of The respondents have taken the stand that there has been a very steep rise in the prices of sugar which is doubtless an essential commodity It has further been alleged that one of the major factors responsible for the present rise in the prices of sugar is that there is a sharp rise in the demand for consumption of sugar whereas its production has slumped to a very low level Further the Government required distribution of molasses at a fixed price of Rs per quintal to the mills whereas there was no such obligation on the power crushers Finally because of the monthly release system the factories could sell only released quantity during a particular month whereas there was no such restriction on khandsari units owned by the petitioners It was further pointed out in the counter affidavit that keeping in view the fact that the sugar stocks of were likely to be exhausted by the middle of November it was considered necessary to maintain an adequate supply of sugarcane to the sugar factories which would have started production earlier because of the incentives given to them by <ORG> In an additional affidavit filed by the respondents sworn by <NAME> Joint Cane Commissioner <ORG> it was pointed out that khandsari sugar could never be a substitute for sugar produced by sugar mills because khandsari sugar is not used for domestic purpose in preference to mill sugar as the former has higher molasses content and has unpleasant smell and taste It was further alleged that in public distribution it is only the mill sugar which is supplied at fair price to the consumers at large and which also forms the bulk of the export There is no reliable evidence to rebut the aforesaid facts detailed in the counter affidavit of the respondents Thus in view of the factors detailed above it was contended by <ORG> that it was in public interest that with a view to remove shortage of sugar and achieve equal distribution of sugarcane to the mills the impugned notification was passed which seems to strike a just balance between the requirements of the country and those of the khandsari units The Attorney General contended that since the ban was imposed only for a very short period of about one month and a half there could be no appreciable loss to the khandsari units and even if there was some loss it could be recouped after the ban was lifted because the working cost of the khandsari units was much less than that of the mills The learned counsel Mr <NAME> appearing for the petitioners countered the inferences drawn by the respondents with the submission that although the above facts may not be disputed yet it was not correct to say that the khandsari units had put the mills completely out of competition It was further pointed out by <ORG> that only sugar mills are in the private sector and ensuring actual availability of sugar at reasonable rates to the sugar mills was the prime consideration which formed the basis of impugned notification in conformity with the object of the Act of and the Control Order so as to maintain a fair price for the general public In inversion loss however there is some difference and great reliance has been placed on these observations of the author Besides there is no evidence or allegation in any of the affidavits filed by the petitioners to the effect that any new methodo logy or innovation was adopted by any of the petitioners Afterall the petitioners were working their crushers under a licence granted to them under the Licensing Order and the impugned notification merely seeks to regulate the right and not to abolish the same For the above reasons the first contention put forward by the petitioners that the restrictions imposed by the impugned notification are unreasonable is hereby overruled and it is held that such restrictions clearly contain the quality of reasonableness and when tested on the touchstone of the principles laid down by the various authorities referred to above they fully satisfy all the requirements of a reasonable restriction This takes us to contention No raised by the petitioners The Control Order itself having been passed under contains sufficient guidelines checks and balances to prevent any misuse or abuse of the power conferred on the authorities concerned under clause Power to issue directions to producers of khandsari sugar power crushers khandsari units crushers and cooperative societies The Central Government may from time to time by general or special order issue directions to any producer of khandsari sugar or owner of a power crusher khandsari unit or crusher or the agent of such producer or owner or a cooperative society regarding the purchase of sugar or sugarcane juice production maintenance of stocks storage price packing payment disposal delivery and distribution of sugar cane gur gul jaggery and rab or khandsari sugar or the period or hours to be worked To begin with it may be noticed that the power to issue orders or directions from time to time is conferred on <ORG> which is undoubtedly a very high authority and must be presumed to act in a just and reasonable manner this Court made the following observations At any rate it has been pointed out in more than one decision of this Court that when the power has to exercised by one of the of the highest officers the fact that no appeal has been provided for is a matter of no moment It was said that though the power was discretionary but it was not necessarily discriminatory and abuse of power could not be easily assumed There was moreover a presumption that public officials would discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with rules of law On the other hand where the power is conferred on such a high authority as <ORG> the presumption will be that the power will be exercised in a bona fide manner and according to law It was however submitted that the Notification has been passed by the Cane Commissioner <ORG> and it does not contain any materials or reasons why the ban was imposed on the crushers owned by the petitioners There was no question of creating any monopoly to benefit the mills particularly when a very large majority of the mills were controlled by the <ORG> or cooperative societies and only a small fraction of them were working in the private sector The third limb of the argument on this point was that there was was no rational nexus between the prohibition contained in the Notification preventing the petitioners from working their crushers even though for a short period and the object sought to be achieved by it Even though the crushers may have paid a higher price in the long run the sufferers would be the sugarcane growers as also the consumers who would be deprived of the sugar produced by the mills which was undoubtedly superior to the khandsari sugar and has a vaster area of consumption in the country and is also meant for purposes of export The report entitled Studies on Specific Conductances of Indian Sugar referred to above details the distinctive features of the white sugar produced by the mills and the khandsari sugar where the various features of the nature and character of sugar are pointed out thus Owing to this loss of production there was keen competition for purchase of sugarcane between the sugar mill owners and the khandsari units Regarding the other distinctive features the mere ipse dixit of deponent <NAME> who has sworn an affidavit there is absolutely no documentary evidence to support the features pointed out or relied upon by the Additional Advocate General In these circumstances it has not been proved to our satisfaction that there is any real distinction between a vertical and a horizontal power crusher and we regard both as falling in the same class In these circumstances therefore we hold that in so far as the word vertical used in the impugned Notification is concerned it must be struck down as being violative of Art This however does not render the entire notification void because the word vertical used in the notification is clearly severable from the other portions of the notification We now come to contention No by which it was urged that the express language of clause of the Control Order does not contemplate a complete prohibition of the production of an article but envisages mere regulation of the period or hours of working We are unable to agree with the contention of Mr <NAME> that the two words must be taken to have been used in clause in the same sense Mr <NAME> as also other counsel for the petitioners submitted that the mere fact that there is no express provision in clause for hearing the petitioners before imposing any restrictions on their business provides good reason to hold that the right to be heard was inherent in the very act of prohibition since the stoppage of the business of the petitioners would entail civil consequences Thus they argued as no hearing was given to the petitioners the notification was void and inoperative which may be extracted thus Indeed natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular law where a spiritual touch enlivens legislation administration and adjudication to make fairness a creed of life It has many colours and shades many forms and shapes and save where valid law excludes it applies when people are affected by acts of Authority It is the bone of healthy government recognised from earliest times and not a mystic testament of judge made law The dichotomy between administrative and quasi judicial functions vis a vis the doctrine of natural justice is presumably Obsolescent after Kraipak SCR in India and <NAME> Ch We consider it a valid point to insist on observance of natural justice in the area of administrative decision making so as to avoid the devaluation of this principle by administrators already alarmingly insensitive to the rationale of audi alteram partem Strong reliance was also placed on the observations of this Court in <NAME> <NAME> where Bhagwati after full discussion of the entire subject observed thus The law must therefore now be taken to be well settled that even in an administrative proceeding which involves civil consequences the doctrine of natural justice must be held to be applicable A number of other decisions were also cited on the question of natural justice and we agree with the propositions adumbrated by Mr <NAME> that normally where an administrative order adversely affects the valuable rights of the party affected a reasonable opportunity of hearing must be given to the person affected It has already been pointed out by us while discussing the case of the respondent that there was an acute shortage of sugar which was not made available to consumers at reasonable rates and the situation caused serious dissatisfaction among the people Afterall the notification directed stoppage of operation of the petitioners crushers only for a very short period and they would have had an opportunity of recouping their loss after they were allowed to function because the proportion of consumption of khandsari sugar was limited as indicated above supra and particularly on the following observations made by <NAME> Price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material It could not therefore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price Reasonableness for purposes of judging whether there was an excess of power or an arbitrary exercise of it is really the demonstration of a reasonable nexus between the matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of exercise of that power Even so the <ORG> clearly decided that a measure like the one we have in the instant case is purely of a legislative character and there is no question of complying with the rules of natural justice in such cases For the reasons aforesaid we find ourselves in complete agreement with the argument of the Attorney General that the impugned notification having been passed to effectuate the object or ideal to be achieved in order to solve a national crisis cannot but be considered a legislative measure so as to exclude rules of natural justice The contention raised by the petitioners on this ground is therefore overruled In contention No another infirmity pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners was that the impugned notification is clearly violative of clause of the Control Order itself because the prohibition against the working of the power crushers even for a short period amounted to a partial revocation of the licences granted to the petitioners under clause of the Licensing Order In order to appreciate this contention it is necessary to extract clause of the Control Order which runs Where all or any of the powers conferred upon <ORG> by this Order have been delegated in pursuance of sub clause I to any officer or any authority of a State Government every Order or direction issued by such officer or authority in exercise of that power may be amended varied or rescinded by <ORG> to whom the officer or authority is subordinate either suo motu or on an application made within a period of thirty days from the date of the order or direction Provided that no order revoking a licence or permit issued to a person shall be made without giving such person an opportunity to make representation Reliance was particularly placed on the proviso extracted above It was contended that even a temporary suspension of the operation of power crushers amounted to a partial revocation of the licence granted to the petitioners and that therefore it was incumbent on the authorities concerned to give the petitioners an opportunity of being heard and making a representation before such revocation took effect Since a revocation or cancellation of the licence would operate to the serious prejudice of the licensee and affect him adversely it was considered necessary and expedient to give him a hearing We are fully satisfied that the impugned notification does not attract the conditions laid down in the proviso so as to confer upon the petitioners a right of hearing It was further submitted by the counsel for the petitioners that even if clause did not apply because the notification is of a legislative character a hearing would have removed the apprehensions of the petitioners This argument has no substance because once it is held that the notification is impressed with a legislative character the question of hearing does not arise It may be true that despite the fact that there is no necessity of hearing the Government could have evolved some method of giving a very short notice to the <ORG> and taking its views If the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices Mr <NAME> appearing for some of the petitioners raised a novel argument which was to the effect that not only the notification impugned but also the Control Order was violative of Art It was contended that since the <ORG> had already fixed reserved areas for the factories the selection of khandsari units for banning or stopping their production amounted to a mini classification without any rational basis Not that such action is a legal requirement but it will generate greater confidence of the persons who may be affected by any order to be passed against them Secondly could it not be possible for the Government to allow the crushers to function by regulating the working hours or to fix a quota of sugarcane to be delivered to the mills and the crushers in the ratio of or as may be advised by the experts and to insist that both the crushers and the mills should pay a uniform price to the cane growers The counsel for the petitioners have brought to our notice a disturbing element in the entire case which is that in the past although the sugarcane growers supplied sugarcane on condition of payment to them of the support price fixed It would indeed be extremely desirable for the Government to take steps to see that payment of the price of the quantity of the cane supplied to the mills or the crushers is paid against delivery or at any rate within a reasonable time thereafter so as to provide a strong incentive to the farmers to increase their production and earn substantial profits by supplying the sugarcane to mills or crushers during the crushing season October to May The result is that all the contentions raised by the petitioners except the one raised by Mr <NAME> that the introduction of the word vertical was violative of Art no relief can be given even to the petitioners represented by Mr <NAME>
