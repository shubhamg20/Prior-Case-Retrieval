In this cross reference the <ORG> has referred to this court the following questions of law under section of the Income tax Act At the instance of the <ORG> Assessment years and Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case <ORG> was justified in holding that gratuity to the extent up to which it was exempt under section of the Income tax Act should not be considered for the purpose of making the disallowance under section A of the Income tax Act At the instance of the assessee common question for all the assessment years and Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a proper interpretation of the provisions of section of the Income tax Act the <ORG> was justified in holding that the unabsorbed depreciation of Rs which was already deducted by <ORG> in working out the written down value of its assets taken over by the assessee company on amalgamation should not be added back for the purpose of working out the written down value of those very assets in the hands of the assessee company for determining the depreciation admissible on those assets At the instance of the assessee Assessment year only Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a proper interpretation of the provisions of section A of the Income tax Act <ORG> was justified in holding that in respect of salary paid to ex employees the allowance under that section should be restricted to the maximum of Rs Section A provides that expenditure incurred by an assessee on its employees covered by that provision is not to be allowed beyond the limits prescribed by section A i We propose to first deal with the first question referred to us at the instance of the assessee Explanation it was stated provided that for the purpose of arriving at the written down value depreciation not merely actually allowed but also deperciation carried forward was to be treated as depreciation actually allowed for the purpose of clause of sub section of section The expression written down value is defined in section as the actual cost to the assessee if acquired during the previous year and the actual cost less all depreciation actually allowed if the assets are acquired in some earlier year since the assets herein are taken over from <ORG> it is common ground that Explanation A inserted in section by the Finance No In respect of depreciation of buildings machinery plant or furniture owned by the assessee and used for the purposes of the business or profession the following deductions shall subject to the provisions of sections be allowed ii in the case of buildings machinery plant or furniture other than ships covered by clause i such percentage on the written down value thereof as may in any case or class of cases be prescribed Where in the assessment of the assessee or if the assessee is a registered firm or an unregistered firm assessed as a registered firm in the assessment of its partners full effect cannot be given to any allowance under clause i or clause ii or clause iv or clause or clause vi of sub section or under clause i of sub section A in any previous year owing to there being no profits or gains chargeable for that previous year or owing to the profits or gains chargeable being less that the allowance then subject to the provisions of sub section of section and sub section of section the allowance or part of the allowance to which effect has not been given as the case may be shall be added to the amount of the allowance for depreciation for the following previous year and deemed to be part of that allowance or if there is no such allowance for that previous year be deemed to be the allowance for that previous year and so on for the succeeding previous years In sections to and in this section unless the context otherwise requires written down value means a in the case of assets acquired in the previous year the actual cost to the assessee in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under this Act or under the Indian Income tax Act or any Act repealed by that Act or under any executive orders issued when the Indian Income tax Act was in force Explanation A But if unabsorbed depreciation carried forward under section is not taken into account for the purpose of computing the written down value depreciation in the years in which carried forward depreciation remains unabsorbed for paucity of profits is likely to be the same But for Explanation an assessee would be entitled to deduction under section iii on the basis of the written down value without taking into account the unabsorbed depreciation carried forward under section even though the assessee will be entitled to the set off of the unabsorbed depreciation carried forward under section Arguments were advanced by the parties in support of their rival claims as regards the scope of the legal fiction It has been held by <ORG> in a number of cases that legal fictions are only for a definite purpose and they are limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond that purpose In this view of the matter it has to be held that the written down value of the assets in this case will be the actual cost of the assets to <ORG> less depreciation actually allowed to the company The object of Explanation A is stated to be at page As a corollary to the provision at i above the actual cost as also the written down value of the building machinery plant or furniture transferred by the amalgamating company to the amalgamated company will be taken in the assessment of the amalgamated company to be the same as in the case of the amalgamating company Further for the purpose of the provision in the Income tax Act that the aggregate amount of depreciation allowed from year to year in respect of any asset will be limited to its actual cost the depreciation actually allowed to the amalgamating company in the assets transferred by it to the amalgamated company will also be taken into account In other words when the aggregate of the depreciation allowed to the amalgamating company and the amalgamated company in respect of such assets is equal to the actual cost of the assets in the hands of the amalgamating company the amalgamated company will not be entitled to any further depreciation on such assets Section it may be stated while defining a number of expressions makes it crystal clear that all definitions in that section are subject to the context requiring otherwise in the circumstances assuming we had come to the conclusion that the written down value of the assets in terms of section read with Explanation A and Explanation is the actual cost of the assets reduced both by depreciation actually allowed and unabsorbed depreciation computed but not allowed we might still have considered whether the context required some other equitable meaning of written down value Accordingly we answer the first question in the assessee reference in the negative and in favour of the assessee This takes us to the second question in the assessee reference The dispute is about the limit on the expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to its former employee the limit is prescribed under section A i which reads as under The limits referred to in clause a are the following namely i in respect of the expenditure referred to in sub clause i of clause a in the case of an employee an amount calculated at the rate of five thousand rupees for each month or part thereof comprised in the period of his employment in India during the previous year and in the case of a former employee being an individual who cease or ceased to be the employee of the assessee during the previous year or any earlier previous year sixty thousand rupees That limit is an amount calculated at the rate of Rs This limit is in the case of expenditure incurred by the assessee on former employees irrespective of whether such former employees had or had not worked with the assessee as employees for any time during the previous year It is not the case of the assessee in the present case that employees who became former employees during the previous year fell into two independent categories so that for the period they worked as employees limit will be at the rate of Rs there is any good reason for not holding that the limit in the case of former employees should also be Rs If that was so and in our judgment it was so there is no reason why the limit available to the existing employees should not be a limit in the case of former employees Accordingly we answer the second question at the instance of the assessee as reframed by us in the negative and in favour of the assessee This takes us to the third and the last question in the assessee reference As a result almost all the assets of <ORG> company including the closing stock were taken over by the assessee company there is no dispute that the method of valuing the closing stock in the case of <ORG> company was different from the method of valuation of closing stock regularly followed by the assessee company and that if the method of valuation of closing stock followed by <ORG> company was also adopted by the assessee company from <ORG> company was the assessee opening stock the <ORG> held that the assessee could not follow one method for valuing the opening stock and another method for valuing the closing stock valuing the closing stock of the assessee out of the stock taken out from <ORG> company on the same basis as the stock was valued by <ORG> company In the circumstances there is no question of applying the method of valuation applied to its stock by <ORG> company as regards this stock so far as the assessee company is concerned As regards the valuation of the closing stock the assessee has admittedly valued it on the method which it is regularly following for valuing its closing stock Accordingly we answer the third question also in the negative and in favour of the assessee There is only one question of law involving assessment years and in the departmental reference For this purpose it is desirable to refer to the provisions of section A which reads as under A a Where the assessee i incurs any expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the payment of any salary to an employee or a former employee or ii incurs any expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any perquisite whether convertible into money or not to an employee or incurs directly or indirectly any expenditure or is entitled to any allowance in respect of any assets of the assessee used by an employee either wholly or partly for his own purposes or benefit then subject to the provisions of clause so much of such expenditure or allowance as is in excess of the limit specified in respect thereof in clause shall not be allowed as a deduction The sub clause evidently uses the expression where an assessee incurs any expenditure resulting in the payment of any salary to an employee This means that the amount of gratuity should result in the payment of salary to the employee In this sub section a salary has the meaning assigned to it in clause read with clause of section subject to the following modifications namely in the said clause Thus the word salary for the purpose of clause i has the meaning assigned to it in clause read with clause of section subject to certain other modifications with which we are not concerned herein Item ii thereunder clarifies that what is included in the expression profits in lieu of is the amount other than any payment covered by certain provisions including section However when one considers that item iv thereof includes profits in lieu of salary and clause of section to the contrary particularly when the meaning assigned to salary is as per clause read with clause of section In our judgement when there is a specific provision providing that payment other than a payment referred to in clause of section is profits in lieu of and thus a part of salary it is not possible to accept that the entire amount of gratuity is to be treated as salary for the purpose of section A a i It may be clarified that the assessee case was not that gratuity was not at all includible as salary for the purpose of considering disallowance under section A and we have not considered that question in the present reference therefore we answer the question referred to us at the instance of the <ORG> in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee
