Can a father maintain a petition for compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act in respect of the death of his son in an automobile accident when the mother is alive That is the question that arises for determination in this appeal More than a year later i on February he made an application I A IV to implead the mother of the deceased as the second petitioner The third issue is whether the death of <NAME> was on account of his own negligence the first issue is regarding the right of the petitioners to claim compensation the fifth issue is regarding the maintainability of the petition and the second issue relates to the quantum of compensation In order to appreciate the above contention it is necessary to set out certain statutory provisions An application for compensation arising out of an accident of the nature specified in Sub section of Section may be made a by the person who has sustained the injury or where death has resulted from the accident by the legal representatives of the deceased or by any agent duly authorised by the person injured or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be Rule of those Rules contains certain definitions Sub rule of Rule provides that the expression legal representative shall have the meaning assigned to it under Sub section of Section legal representative means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party suing or sued Section of the Hindu Succession Act provides inter alia that the property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve firstly upon the heirs specified in Class I of the Schedule to that Act and that if there is no heir of Class I then upon the heirs specified in Class IT of that Schedule The Fatal Accidents Act was enacted to provide compensation to families for loss occasioned by the death of a person caused by actionable wrong Every such action or suit shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent and child if any of the person whose death shall have been so caused and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor administrator or representative of the person deceased and in every such action the court may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought and the amounts so recovered after deducting all costs and expenses including the costs not recovered from the defendant shall be divided amongst the before mentioned parties or any of them in such shares as the court by its judgment or decree shall direct <NAME> who spoke for the Bench referred to the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act and said that Sections to of the Act have not created any new right or any new remedy but have only changed the forum for enforcement of the remedy and that the term legal representative in Section A included the person referred to as representative in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act namely the wife or husband parent and child of the deceased His Lordship added that since the father comes within the meaning of parent he can make his claim before <ORG> and that the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain his suit for such claim is clearly barred His Lordship said that that term used in Section A of the Act cannot have the same meaning as that attributed to it in Section Civil Procedure Code and that the right of the representative of a person who died of an automobile accident to put forward a claim under Section A of the Act cannot be confined to persons who come within the ambit of the term legal representative as defined in Section Civil Procedure Code From this review of the authorities it will appear that judicial decisions have extended the sense of the term legal representative beyond that of its ordinary meaning of administrator executor and heir and though such extension has been attended with doubt and has in some cases been the subject of conflicting decision it appears to me to be too late now to endeavour however convenient it might be to secure for the term that which is perhaps its strict and legitimate sense I agree therefore in holding that the term is not limited to administrators executors and heirs and am of opinion that it must now be held to include any person who in law represents the estate of a deceased judgment debtor That application was resisted on the ground that the claim should have been made both on behalf of the father and the mother of the deceased and that as the father alone had made the claim no amount could be awarded in respect of the loss caused to the mo ther It also becomes unnecessary to go into the question whether appellant the mother was prevented by sufficient cause from making the claim for compensation within the time fixed in Section A In the result this appeal is allowed the order of the <ORG> dismissing the petition is set aside and the same is remanded to the <ORG> with a direction to dispose of the petition according to law and in the light of this judgment
