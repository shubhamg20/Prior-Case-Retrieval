a Unlike the law in England in India the grant of permission to cross examine his own witness by a party is not conditional on the witness being declared adverse or hostile In fact in the order granting such permission it is preferable to avoid such expressions as declared hostile declared unfavorable etc Whether it be tho grant of permission under Evidence Act to put leading questions or leave under to ask questions which might be put in Cross examination by the adverse party the Indian Evidence Act leaves the matter entirely to the discretion of the <ORG> When a party with the leave of the court confronts his witness with his previous inconsistent statement he A also does so in the hope that the witness might revert to what he had stated previously because if the departure from the prior statement is not deliberate but duo to faulty memory or a like cause there is every possibility of the witness veering round to his former statement The High <ORG> was also not competent to use the statements of these witnesses recorded by the police during investigation for seeking assurance of tbe prosecution story They can be used only for the purpose of contradicting a prosecution witness in the manner indicated in Evidence Act and for no other purpose Further there was the evidence of defence witnesses which was not successfully impeached by the prosecution in cross examination The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment of <ORG> upholding the conviction and sentence of the appellant under read with of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Penal Code After preparing the seizure memo and the raid report PW A the Inspector sent the same to the police Station for registration of the formal First Information Report I left <ORG> at in uniform for patrol duty at the New Delhi Railway Station platforms because there is a heavy rush of trains at that time No proceedings of the type mentioned above took place in my room I have served in <ORG> for the last years and there is not a single ad verse entry major or minor in my service book In defence the appellant examined five witnesses all members of the Police force Head Constable <NAME> DW testified on the basis of the service record that there was not a single adverse entry in the Character Roll of the appellant and that no less than commendation certificates some of them accompanied by cash rewards were awarded to He further stated that at about a telephone call was received from the sister of the accused from Kirti Nagar whereupon he sent Constable <NAME> to inform the accused about it The learned trial Judge found that the complainant and party are men of shady and questionable character but according to him that was no ground to discard their testimony of the Prevention of Corruption Act he convicted the appellant under sec Perhaps realising that in making use of the police statement it was going too far <ORG> then switched over to the alternative argument It is not only on the basis of the statements falling within the purview of the proviso to section that I am coming to the conclusion that the prosecution has succeed ed in proving its case This silence amounted to a statement made to the police in the course of investigation and as such it was inadmissible being hit by Cr It is maintainted that there is no rule of law that the evidence of an interested witness cannot be acted upon without corroboration that in any case the evidence of PWs and was sufficiently corroborated by the circumstantial evidence consisting of the conduct of the accused in keeping mum to the accusation made by the Inspector and by the factum of Counsel has further invited our attention to the copy of the judgment of the Delhi High <ORG> in Criminal Revision No of <NAME> <NAME> delivered on the th April produced by the appellant A I A According to Counsel the mere fact that the authority given to Inspector <NAME> did not extend to investigation of offences under sec But he admitted that he has been frequently visiting the <NAME> of <NAME> and on the day of occurrence also he was there when according to the witness Mst The above circumstances further lend assurance to the appellant plea that he had on several occasions previously reprimanded these witnesses for visiting the Railway Station for immoral trade Again PW would have it believed that he had Rs in all with him which he gave to the appellant <NAME> and not <NAME>who had given this money to the appellant It is true that there is no absolute rule that the evidence of an interested witness cannot be accepted without corroboration We have already discussed the first and found that instead of advancing the case for the prosecution it lends assurance to the explanation of the appellant that <NAME> had been brought for interrogation as he was roaming there in suspicious circumstances As regards the reticence of the appellant on the query made by the Inspector we do not think it necessary to burden this judgment with a discussion of the question whether this conduct amounts to a statement made to a Police officer in the course of investigation and as such hit sec But we cannot lose sight of the stark fact that he was an Inspector of <ORG> Although the power conferred on him under the order dated March by the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi did not extend to the investigation of an offence under Penal Code yet with zeal outrunning discretion he went ahead with the execution of the trap and the investigation Not being an independent witness his evidence could not furnish the kind of corroboration requisite in the circumstances of the case This takes us to the evidence of the independent witnesses PW and With the leave or the court the Public Prosecutor cross examined and confronted them with their contradictory statements which they had made to Inspector <NAME> during investigation the question is SCI could the court validly pick out tiny bits from their evidence and use the same to support the prosecution case Since this vexing question frequently arises and the observations made by this <ORG> in <NAME> case ibid do not appeal to have been properly understood it will be appropriate to clarify the law on the point This theory or assumption gave rise to a considerable conflict of opinion as to whether it was competent for a party to show that his own witness had made statements out of <ORG> inconsistent with the evidence given by him in court Section provides A party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character but he may in case the witness shall in the opinion of the Judge prove adverse contradict him by other evidence or by leave of the judge prove that he has made at other times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony but before such last mentioned proof can be given the circumstances of the supposed statement sufficient to designate the particular occasion must be mentioned to the witness and he must be asked whether or not he has made such statement To steer clear of the controversy over the meaning of the terms hostile witness adverse witness unfavourable witness which had given rise to considerable difficulty and conflict of opinion in England the authors of the Indian Evidence Act seem to have advisedly avoided the use of any of those terms so that in India the grant of permission to cross examine his own witness by a party is not conditional on the witness being declared adverse or hostile to ask questions which might be put in cross examination by the adverse party the Indian Evidence Act leaves the matter entirely to the discretion of the court see the observations of Sir <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Therefore in the order granting such permission it is preferable to avoid the use of such expressions such as declared hostile declared unfavourable the significance of which is still not free from the historical cobwebs which in their wake bring a misleading legacy of confusion and conflict that had so long vexed <ORG> If the departure from the prior statement is not deliberate but is due to faulty memory or a like cause there is every possibility of the witness veering round to his former statement uses the phrase put any questions to him which might be put in cross examination by the adverse party After an exhaustive survey of case law <NAME> who delivered the main judgment neatly summed up the law at pages of the Report In my opinion the fact that a witness is dealt with under section of the Evidence Act even when under that section he is cross examined to credit in no way warrants a direction to the jury that they are bound in law to place no reliance on his evidence or that the party who called and cross examined him can take no advantage from any part of his evidence There is moreover no rule of law that if a jury thinks that a witness has been discredited on one point they may not give credit to him on another The proper direction to the jury is that before relying on the evidence given by the witness at the trial the jury should take into consideration the fact that he made the previous statement hut they must not treat the previous statement as being any evidence at all against the prisoner of the facts therein alleged In a criminal case however the previous unsworn statement of a witness for the prosecution is not evidence against the accused of the truth of the facts stated therein save in very special circumstances as corroboration under section of his testimony If the case be put of the previous statement having been made in the presence and hearing of the accused this fact might under section alter the position but the true view even then is not that the statement is evidence of the truth of what it contains The Bombay Madras Patna Rajasthan Oudh Punjab Madhya Pradesh Orissa Mysore Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir Courts have also taken the same view It is for the Judge of fact to consider in each case whether as a result of such cross examination and contradiction the witness stands thoroughly discredited or can still be believed in regard to a part of his testimony If the Judge finds that in the process the credit of the witness has not been completely shaken he may after reading and considering the evidence of the witness as a whole with due caution and care accept in the light of the other evidence on the record that part of his testimony which he finds to be credit worthy and act upon it In the light of the above principles it will be seen that in law a part of the evidence of the <NAME> witnesses who were thoroughly cross examined and contradicted with their inconsistent police statements by the Public Prosecutor could be used or availed of by the prosecution to support its case These witnesses contradicted substantially their previous statements and as a result of the cross examination their credit was substantially if not wholly shaken Nor was <ORG> competent to use the statements of these witnesses recorded by the police during investigation for seeking assurance for the prosecution story such statements can be used only for the purpose of contradicting a prosecution witness in the manner indicated in Evidence Act and for no other purpose
