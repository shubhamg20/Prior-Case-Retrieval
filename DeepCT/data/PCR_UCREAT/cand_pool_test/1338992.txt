Only a few facts require to be stated in order to explain how the question referred in this case arises That year the Income tax Officer seems to have made an enquiry into the circumstances in which the machinery had been acquired and he came to the conclusion that its real cost to the assessee had been not Rs had already been allowed to the assessed he came to the conclusion that the written down value had been reduced to a minus figure and therefore there was no further depreciation allowance to be allowed Necessarily in the next assessment also that for the year he made a similar order He said that the terms of Section vi sufficed for him and he would only draw attention to what the section enjoined According to Mr <NAME> the language of Section vi limited the Income tax Officer to working down to the written down value for the year for which he was making the assessment from the written down value accepted for the previous year Section vi is expressed in the follow ing terms Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely Mr <NAME> contention was that the written down value had a well understood meaning in commerce and so far as the Income tax Act was concerned both the method of determining it and the quantum at which it was to be determined were regulated by the rules framed In those words there was no room according to Mr <NAME> for looking further behind than at the written down value immediately preceding and if that was so any revision of the basic figure of the original cost which had been gradually scaled down to the written down value of the previous year was wholly excluded by the section and entirely unwarranted As Mr <NAME> said that he would not rely upon the principle of res judicata or anything like the rule of estoppel but would be content to rely upon the statute itself Mr <NAME> sought to meet section by section He referred us to the definition of written down value as contained in Section of the Act According to that section written down value means we are not concerned with Clause a in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under this Act or any Act repealed thereby or under executive orders issued when the Indian Income tax Act was in force Mr <NAME> contended that Clause although it was a definition section clearly indicated what the task of the Income tax Officer was when he had to determine the depreciation allowance for any year other than the year following the year of the purchase He had to see what the actual cost to the assessee had been and then see how much depreciation allowance had been granted to him in all up to the time and then take the difference between the two sums as the written down value for the year concerned Since the two component parts of the definition were a actual cost to the assessee and depreciation so far allowed Mr <NAME> contended that there was nothing to prevent the Income tax Officer from determining for himself what the actual cost had been and in fact the section required him to do so As regards Mr <NAME> actual argument Mr <NAME> answer was that if the intention of the <ORG> was to limit the Income tax Officer in the way contended for by Mr <NAME> then Clause of Section might well have said that in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the written down value would be the value determined by deducting from the written down value of the previous year the amount of the statutory percentage Instead of doing so the section specifically referred the Income tax Officer back to the original cost and back to the amounts of allowance granted in the past and thus committed to him a task of not merely performing a mathematical operation on the basis of the written down value of the previous year but one of determining the written down value himself The definition it appears to me completely excludes the view suggested by Mr <NAME> as to the nature of the operation to be performed under the latter part of Section vi Clearly the limit to which the income tax Officer can go back does not stop at the written down value of the previous year but extends up to the figure of the original cost and the method enjoined by Section is not that the Income tax Officer should merely scale the written down value of the previous year down but that he should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary take also into consideration the allowance granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the written down value for the assessment year with which he is concerned It appears to me that neither is there any principle of res judicata or estoppel standing in the way of the Income tax Officer proceeding in the manner I have mentioned above nor do the terms of Section vi themselves limit him in the way suggested by Mr <NAME>
