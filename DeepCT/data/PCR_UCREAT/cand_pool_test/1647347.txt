successors to <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the Subsidiary Company against the judgment and order of <ORG> dismissing the writ petitions filed by them On November a notice under Section of the Income Tax Act was issued to <ORG> calling upon it to file a return of its income for the Assessment Years for the year ending June and for year ending June <ORG> replied stating that inasmuch as <ORG> has been amalgamated with <ORG> under a scheme of amalgamation sanctioned by <ORG> and Calcutta and because the said amalgamation was with effect from January there was no question of <ORG> filing a return for the said two assessment years There was exchange of notices replies thereafter which it is not necessary to mention at this stage Ultimately the Income Tax Officer issued a notice under Section asking for compliance with it by February At that stage the appellant company filed writ petitions in <ORG> questioning the aforesaid notices In the writ petitions filed by the appellant the main ground urged was that inasmuch as the amalgamation has taken effect on and from January the Income Tax Officer had no authority to call upon <ORG> to file a return for any period subsequent thereto It was submitted that <ORG> had no income of its own indeed no existence of its own in law on or after January He submitted that this allotment of shares took place only in June He submitted that while <ORG> was incurring losses <ORG> was making substantial profits and that the scheme of amalgamation was merely a device to avoid paying taxes on the income earned by <ORG> There is nothing in the orders of <ORG>s to show that the said orders were to be effective from January Counsel submitted that subsequent to January <ORG> may have carried on business awaiting the orders of the <ORG> but it could not do otherwise and that the business so carried on by it was as an agent of and for and on behalf of <ORG> and not on its own account Both these dates are prior to June the last day of the accounting year as sanctioned by the Income Tax Officer since the income of the company can be said to accrue only at the end of the year when the accounts are made up and not from day to day it

to vi of sub section of Section Sub section provides that where the order sanctioning the amalgamation provides for any of the matters in clauses i to vi aforesaid they shall take effect as provided in the order We may now refer to the scheme of amalgamation as passed at the meetings of the shareholders of both <ORG> <ORG> In other words <ORG> has taken the view that in the absence of any date being specified in the order of <ORG> as the date of amalgamation the date of the order of <ORG> Company Courts shall be taken as the date of amalgamation On this basis <ORG> has upheld the validity of the notices issued by the Income Tax Officer which notices were impugned in the writ petition and dismissed the writ petition If the <ORG> so specifies a date there is little doubt that such date would be the date of amalgamation date of transfer In the light of the view taken by us on the principal question it is not necessary to consider the alternate submission urged by <NAME> The writ petitions filed by the appellant in <ORG> shall be deemed to have been allowed We however make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the plea of the learned counsel for the <ORG> that the amalgamation itself is a device designed to evade the taxes legitimately payable by the subsidiary company
