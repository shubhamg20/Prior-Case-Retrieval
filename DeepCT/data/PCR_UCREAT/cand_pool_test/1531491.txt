HEADNOTE The only question involved in the appeal was whether the so called <ORG> of the <ORG> textile undertaking <ORG> was a separate and distinct business and therefore the surplus lands did form part of the assets in relation to the textile undertaking within the meaning of sub section of section of the Textile Undertakings Taking Over of Management Act It was realised that none of the mills falling under Category III could be expected to survive on a sound basis without financial assistance from the <ORG> <ORG> controlled institutions and nationalised banks <ORG> classified the mills falling in Category III into four groups <ORG> decided as a matter of policy that it was desirable to achieve the process of nationalisation in two stages by first taking over the management of the textile undertakings and thereafter enact suitable legislation to nationalise the same As the taking over the management was with a view to implement the decision to nationalise the said textile mills there was no question of holding an inquiry either under the Industries Development and Regulation Act or under the Sick Textile Undertakings Taking Over of Management Act The Ordinance was later replaced by an Act of Parliament being Textile Undertakings Taking Over of Management Act which by sub section of section I was brought into force with retrospective effect from October the date of promulgation of the Ordinance In appeal the appellant contended that the surplus lands appurtenant to the textile undertaking which the respondents called as <ORG> of the <ORG> was not a separate or distinct business and therefore the lands did form part of the assets in relation to the textile undertaking within the meaning of sub section of section of the Act Allowing the appeals by certificate the <ORG> HELD The words assets in relation to the textile undertaking used in sub section of section of the Act have a very wide connotation The Note attached to the report of <ORG> includes the total lands belonging to the respondent company for the purpose of determining the value of the assets of the company and does not exclude <ORG> There can be no doubt that the legislative intent and object of the impugned Act was to secure the socialisation of such surplus lands with a view to sustain the sick textile undertakings so that they could be properly utilised by the company for social good i in resuscitating the dying textile undertakings Hence a paradoxical situation should have been avoided by adding a narrow and pedantic construction of a provision like sub section of section of the Act which provides for the consequences that ensue upon the taking over in public interest of the management of a textile undertaking under sub section thereof as a step towards nationalisation of such undertakings which was clearly against the national interest From the official record it is clear i that there was in reality no such separate business as Real Estate Business carried on by the company The proceeds were all ploughed back into the textile business to pay off the debts and vi there was no separate account of <ORG> and the respondents have not laid any real foundations on pleadings that the Real Estate business was separate and distinct from the textile business The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN These appeals on certificate directed against the judgment and order of <ORG> dated June raise a question of far reaching public importance lakhs and the only major scheme of modernisation that the Company planned was under the Soft Loan Scheme when in it made an application to <ORG> <ORG> since a substantial portion of its machinery was not in a state of good repairs It had leased out its process house to Messrs Bhartiya Electric Steel <ORG> Limited a sister concern of the <NAME> from to provide financial support to the mill but it was not fruitful There was also loss in <ORG> Even during when there was a textile boom in the country the <ORG> losses were to the tune of Rs There were accumulated losses of the order of over Rs It occupies an important position in the industrial field in India both because it produces an essential commodity the production of which makes the country self sufficient and also the export of which helps in building up its foreign exchange reserves It is also of importance because it gives employment to a large number of persons Faced with the problem of rendering financial assistance and rehabilitation to the textile industry <ORG> carried out a survey of the sick textile mills which had a disasterous effect on the financial viability which could only be attributed to mismanagement and a situation further worsened by the general strike It was realized that none of the mills falling under Category III could be expected to survive on a sound basis without financial assistance from the <ORG> <ORG> controlled institutions and nationalised banks After setting out a long term scheme of financing of the textile mill by public financial institutions the report observed Even assuming that the Company will be able to utilize of its cash accruals to liquidate its term liabilities it will take over years for it to repay its term commitments including the funded loan aggregating to Rs <ORG> submitted its report on October i a few days prior to the promulgation of the Ordinance by which it classified the mills falling in Category III into four groups It estimated that the total liabilities of the mills falling in Category III were of the order of Rs <ORG> was of the opinion that the management of such mills had been defective as had there been no mismanagement the mills would not have found themselves in the condition in which they were even before the general strike In the circumstances <ORG> had to consider whether it would be in the public interest that such public finances should be made available to such mills particularly when there were serious allegations of mismangement frittering away of assets of the textile undertakings diversion of funds etc As the taking over of the management was with a view to implement the decision to nationalize the said textile mills there was no question of holding an inquiry either under the Industries Development and Regulation Act or under the Sick Textile Undertakings Taking Over of Management Act Prior to November there were several viability surveys made by different authorities namely <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and an independent survey by the <ORG> itself It found that the <ORG> export performance was to the extent of of its total sales and there was possibility of stepping up exports after completion of the scheme of modernisation All these surveys were directed in ascertaining whether the <ORG> textile undertaking was a techno economically viable unit or not and whether it was desirable to provide the <ORG> with working capital The Ordinance was replaced by an Act of <ORG> being Textile Undertakings Taking over of Management Act which by sub of was brought into force with retrospective effect from October the date of promulgation of the Ordinance The preamble to the Act brings out the necessity for such legislation WHEREAS by reason of mismanagement of the affairs of the textile undertakings specified in the First Schedule their financial condition became wholly unsatisfactory even before the commencement in January of the textile strike in Bombay and their financial condition has thereafter further deteriorated AND WHEREAS certain public financial institutions have advanced large sums of money to the companies owning the said undertakings with a view to making the said undertakings viable AND WHEREAS acquisition by the Central Government of the said undertakings is necessary to enable it to invest such large sums of money AND WHEREAS pending the acquisition of the said undertakings it is expedient in the public interest to take over the management of the said undertakings BE it enacted by <ORG> in the Thirtyfourth Year of the Republic of India As the preamble reads the financial condition of the textile undertakings specified in the First Schedule had become wholly unsatisfactory even before the commencement of the textile strike in January in Bombay by reason of mismanagement of the affairs of such undertakings and their financial condition thereafter further deteriorated Many public financial institutions had advanced large sums of money to the textile companies owning the said undertakings with a view to making the said undertakings viable The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Bill reads as follows The Textile Undertakings Taking Over of Management Ordinance was promulgated by the President on th October to vest in <ORG> the management of thirteen textile undertakings pending their nationalisation Certain public financial institutions had with a view to making the said undertakings viable advanced large sums of money to the companies owning these undertakings Once the basic decision of nationalisation was taken a genuine apprehension arose in the Government mind that unless the management of the concerned undertakings was taken over on immediate basis there might be large scale frittering away of assets which would be detrimental to the public interest It thus became urgently necessary for Government to take over Management of the undertakings in the public interest On November the respondents filed a petition under Art It is averred that there are several relevant facts which conclusively show that <ORG> was a separate and independent business being carried on by the <ORG> This had its great disadvantages since the transportation cost increased there was lot of wastage and handling supervision and control of manufacturing activities became inconvenient time consuming and cumbersome There was total lack of scientific or proper planning and annexed to the Writ Petition as order of the Municipal Commissioner granting permission for sub division along with a plan delineating the different plots On January a special resolution was passed at an extraordinary general meeting of the Company in terms of A of the Companies Act to the effect Resolved that pursuant to A of the Companies Act consent be and is hereby accorded to and authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company to carry out the provisions of cl of the Memorandum of Association Upon these facts the respondents filed a petition under art The crucial question that falls for determination is whether the surplus land appurtenant to the mill was not an asset in relation to the textile undertaking within the meaning of sub of of the Textile Undertakings Taking over of Management Act Various contentions have been raised in these appeals but on the view that we take it is not necessary for us to deal with them all We were also referred to a large number of decisions on the contentions so advanced <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> representing the workers of the textile mill The principal contention advanced by the learned counsel was that the words assets in relation to the textile undertaking used in sub of of the Act have a wide legal connotation and they must be construed to mean forming part of and not as belonging to the textile under taking The learned counsel referred to different provisions of the Act to stress that the Act makes a clear distinction between the textile undertaking as defined in and the textile company as defined in Where was the necessity he asks of the special resolution as contemplated by A of the Companies Act unless the shareholders intended and gave consent to the starting of a new business by the <ORG> in real estate Therefore he contends that the passing of a special resolution and filing of the same with the Registrar were necessary concomitants inasmuch as the business in real estate which the <ORG> intended to carry on was a new business and it was not germane i was unrelated to the existing business In substance the submission is that the business of development of property and the sale of plots with industrial galas was an adventure in the nature of trade which was wholly independent of the textile business and merely because the <ORG> was raising finance by selling industrial galas constructed on the lands did not necessarily imply that the lands formed part of the textile undertaking There was in reality no such business much less any real estate business There was no transfer of title to the lands and the so called <ORG> had no capital assets of its own There was no separate account of <ORG> and there is really nothing on record to show that any separate business in real estate was ever started The said activity is totally segregated from the textile undertaking and is a separate and independent business of Petitioner No and it has nothing to do with the Textile Undertaking Even the schedule of fixed assets does not indicate that the alleged Real Estate Division comprising of the surplus lands apart from square yards which now form part of the mill precincts had been separated There is nothing to show that the said lands were not appurtenant to the textile undertaking or their integrality was broken Prior to the year there was no sub division of the lands and as such all the assets of the <ORG> were held in relation to the textile business Plot no admeasuring square yards lying vacant There was no development of this plot The respondents <ORG> created an equitable mortgage in favour of <ORG> to raise finance for the textile business In the schedule of fixed assets attached to and forming part of the balance sheet for the year under the heading Current sets the following entry appears a Current Assets i ii From the balance sheets and Profit and Loss Accounts the conclusion is irresistible that the surplus lands belonging to the <ORG> were held in relation to the textile undertaking within the meaning of sub of of the Act me Note attached to the report of <ORG> includes the total lands belonging to the respondents <ORG> for the purpose of determining the value of the assets of the <ORG> and does not exclude <ORG> There can be no doubt that the legislative intent and object of the impugned Act was to secure the socialisation of such surplus lands with a view to sustain the sick textile undertakings so that they could be properly utilised by the <ORG> for social good i in resuscitating the dying textile under takings Hence a paradoxical situation should have been avoided by adding a narrow and pedantic construction of a provision like sub of of the Act which provides for the consequences that ensue upon the taking over in public interest of the management of a textile undertaking under sub thereof as a step towards nationalisation of such undertakings which was clearly against the national interest In dealing with similar legislation this <ORG> has always adopted a broad and liberal approach in repelling the contention that <ORG> together with <ORG> and all its assets built on a plot adjacent to the New Satgram Coal Mines in the technical Director Bungalow built on a plot outside the A mining area somewhere in and another building on the same plot of land namely the Guest House used for the residence of the officers and staff of the mines were not assets falling within the definition of mine defined in vi vii and xi of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act the <ORG> had occasion to observe It will be seen that there is a difference in the language used in vii and xi To illustrate a workshop which has come into existence for and because of the mine but which also cones to be used for purposes other than of the mine does not on that account alone cease to be a workshop used substantially for the purposes of the mine <ORG> instead of providing that the word mine shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Mines Act has given an enlarged definition of mine in so that not merely the colliery but everything connected with the mining industry should vest in <ORG> i not only that part of the industry which consisted of raising winning and getting coal but also that part of it which consisted in the sale of coal and its supply to customers both of which are a part of an integrated activity me High Court held that the question as to whether the staff car should be treated as belonging to the owners of a mine as part of the mine itself raised disputed questions of fact relating to its user which would have to be determined on the basis of evidence purporting to rely upon the aforesaid decision of this Court in <ORG> case and therefore relegated the parties to have the matter settled by A a civil suit It then went on to say that <ORG> by an enlarged definition of mine in of the Act had indicated the nature of the properties that vest and the question whether a particular asset is taken within the sweep of depends on whether it answers the description given therein and added The staff car in question was undoubtedly a fixed asset of <ORG> and it belonged to respondent <ORG> the owners in relation to the said mine The staff car therefore fell within the definition of mine as contained in Section xii and vested in <ORG> under sub section of Section of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act We have no doubt in our mind that the words assets in relation to the textile undertaking used in sub of of the Act have a very wide connotation Upon that view it is not necessary for us to deal with the other contentions namely the applicability of the main objects rule of construction or as to the purport and effect of the special resolution passed by the <ORG> as contemplated by A of the Companies Act or the tests laid down under the Income Tax Act of and for determining whether a certain receipt realized by an assessee was merely a realization or change of capital assets or was profit realized from an adventure in the nature of trade and was therefore business as defined in of the Income Tax Act and of the Income Tax Act or whether two lines of business constitute the same business under of the Income Tax Act or were separate business We do not think that any useful purpose would be served in referring to the large number of decisions turning upon these questions nor to decisions arising under the Industrial Disputes Act on whether the several under takings carried on by the same company are separate or not which necessarily turns on the question whether they are distinct or inter dependent
