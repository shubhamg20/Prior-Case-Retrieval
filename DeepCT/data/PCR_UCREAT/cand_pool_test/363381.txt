The acquisition proceedings were initiated by a notification dated the th of April issued under Sub section of Section of the Land Acquisition Act herein after referred to as the Act Notices of the proposed acquisition were published in conformity with Rule of the rules framed by <ORG> under Section of the Act but no notice thereof was served individually on either of the petitioners and it is contended on their behalf that the acquisition proceedings are void for want of such notices which it was incumbent on the Collector to serve as per instruction contained in paragraph of Standing Order issued by <ORG> That instruction states Besides publishing the notice as prescribed in Rule of the Appendix I the Collector should see that individual notices are served as far as possible on every person known or believed to be interested in the land and to be acquired in the manner prescribed by Sub sections and of Section of the Land Acquisition Act I of After hearing learned Counsel for the parties at some length I have begun to entertain doubts and I say so with the utmost respect to <NAME> about the correctness of the decision in <NAME> case although have not formed any definite opinion in that behalf The notification was published in the official gazette But individual notices were not given to the petitioners The facts bearing on the question before us are not very much in dispute The Special Deputy <NAME> Land Acquisition Town Planning Coimbatore was named as the authority to discharge the functions of the Collector under the Land Acquisition Act in relation to this acquisition On th April the <ORG> published a declaration in the <ORG> declaring that the lands notified were required for the extension of the municipal school The <NAME> there upon took orders from the <ORG> for acquisition and proceeded to conduct the inquiry into compensation to be awarded to the persons interested in the lands In the events that happened as narrated above the complaint of the petitioners before us is that proper notice of the acquisition had not been given to them by the <ORG> Their complaint before us is that there by they had been deprived of the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition at the right moment and of availing themselves of the inquiry held by the <ORG> In the counter affidavits filed in this Court on behalf of <ORG> and <ORG> there is no denial of the allegation in the writ petition that the petitioners were not served with any individual notices of acquisition immediately following the preliminary notification by the <ORG> in the <ORG> It may therefore be taken as a fact that apart from public notices no individual notices were given to the petitioners informing them about the <ORG> preliminary notification The further question is whether the acquisition proceedings would be invalid if such individual notices were not given to the persons interested in the land Section of the Act which is the pertinent provision in this regard is in the following terms Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for a public purpose a notification to that effect shall be published in the Official Gazette and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the locality The appropriate <ORG> must first be satisfied that any land in a given locality is needed actually or potentially for a public purpose The section does not require that even for the initial formation of its opinion that the land is needed for a public purpose the <ORG> should send notices to the owners of the land convene them and listen to their objections In the present case as we had earlier pointed out the writ petitioners do not seek to challenge the acquisition proceedings on the score that no public notice was given as required by Section or even on the ground that the public notice as actually given by the Collector fell short of what is contemplated by the section Sub section of Section deals with the next step in the procedure for compulsory acquisition and it begins with these words Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer etc There are other indications too in Section to the same effect It requires that the notice should be in writing it should be addressed to the occupier it should be served on him personally and it should give him seven days time But short of obtaining the occupier consent the power of entry can be exercised by the officers authorized in that behalf only after service of individual notices on the occupier How the notice on the occupier is to be served is dealt with by Section which provides that in the case of a notice under Section it shall be effected by the officer therein mentioned by delivering or tendering a copy thereof signed by him to the person intended to be served with the notice Section in terms only refers to Section but it is obvious that this reference cannot appertain to any notice under Sub section of that section it can only refer to the notice of intention to enter the premises issued to the owner or occupier of a residential house by officers generally or specially authorized in that behalf by the <ORG> in connection with the proceedings contemplated by Section and the proviso thereto learned Counsel referred in this connection to an unreported judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> The Land Acquisition Officer Omalur Salem District No of dated st January The conclusion of the learned Judge was that individual notices to persons aggrieved must be given in every case He observed The very intention of Section A of the Act is to give all persons interested in the land which is subject to the com pulsory process to state their objections and after such objections are received the Land Acquisition Officer is mandatorily obliged to give such an objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader Sub section requires that objection shall be made to the Collector in writing It further provides that after the receipt of written objection from any person interested the Collector shall give to him an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader On the conclusion of the inquiry the Collector is to make a report to the Government containing a record of the proceedings and also his recommendations on the objections Section A no doubt confers on the persons interested a right to object to the acquisition but under Sub section this right has to be exercised by them within days after the preliminary notification under Section The person objecting may file his objection on the very next day after the <ORG> publication or on any day falling within a period of days We are satisfied that the right under Section A in content as well as in chronology is a bare right to object to the acquisition Mr <NAME> made a reference to the statement of Objects and Reasons set out in the Bill which introduced Section A in the Act in the year According to this statement The object of the Bill is to provide that a local Government shall not declare under Section of the Act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification under Section for persons interested in the land to put in objection and for such objections to be considered by the local Government the Collector shall cause a public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the locality in which the land is situated and a copy of such notification to be served on the owner and where the owner is not the occupier also on the occupier of the land The said Rule is in the following terms Rule Immediately after the publication of the notification under Section the Collector shall issue a notice stating that the land is needed or is likely to be needed as the case may be for a public purpose and requiring all persons interested in the land to lodge before the Collector within days after the issue of the notification a statement in writing of their objections if any to the proposed acquisition In the course of their judgment the learned Judges observed that Neither Section nor Section A contains any provision for the service of individual notice on any person interested in the land sought to be acquired by a notification under Section It was to the following effect Whenever any notification under Section has been published but the provisions of the section have not been applied and the Collector has under Section issued notice to the parties interested and on or before the last day fixed by the Collector in those notices in this behalf any objection is lodged under Section A Firstly the Collector shall record the objection in his proceedings secondly the Collector shall consider whether the objection is admissible according to these rules Before the learned Judges there was no dispute that this rule formed part of the statutory rules made by the State Government in exercise of its powers under Section of the Act and hence it had the force of law Proceeding to construe the rule the learned Judges held that the words the Collector has under Section issued notices to the parties interested clearly indicated that individual notice should be given to all the parties interested in the land Since such notices were not given to the writ petitioners before them the learned Judges quashed the proceedings So far as the relevant Rule in force in this State is concerned we have no doubt whatever that it does not envisage or contemplate much less expressly provide that individual notices shall be addressed to all the persons interested in the land in addition to the publication of notices in prominent places in the locality It was argued that Rule was not mandatory and if it was it would be against the provisions of Section A which invested the Collector with a complete discretion in the matter of conducting the inquiry his only statutory obligation being that he should serve the notice of the inquiry on the persons who had lodged their objections While Section and Rule are obviously intended to facilitate objections to be lodged by the persons interested in the subject matter of the acquisition neither Section nor Rule contemplates that the Collector should serve individual notices on the persons interested in the lands Under the scheme of Section A the question of sending individual notices to persons hardly arises until the proceedings reach a stage when objections are actually lodged with the Collector and an inquiry into these objections has to be gone into by him It follows therefore that for the purposes of seeing whether or not the initial notices of acquisition should be served individually on all the persons interested in the land we would not have to be searching the provisions of Section A or of the relevant rules bearing on Section A but have to look only to Section and Rule for the purpose But the lays down the following further instructions The notice should also be served individually on every person known or believed to be interested in the land to be acquired in the manner prescribed by Sub sections and of Section It is this last passage on which Mr <NAME> places strong reliance Their contention was that the Collector was bound to serve individual notices on them of the inquiry under Section A giving them an opportunity to object to the acquisition considering that he knew that they were the real owners of the land which had been notified by the <ORG> for acquisition Before <NAME> reliance for the petitioners was mainly placed on <ORG> Standing Order No which in turn was based on No Revenue dated th February issued by the State <ORG> portions of which we have set out earlier in this judgment The <ORG> Standing Order is to be found at page of the Land Acquisition Manual and it contains inter alia the following instructions Besides publishing the notice as prescribed in Rule of the Appendix the Collector should see that the individual notices are served as far as possible on every person known or believed to be interested in the land to be acquired in the manner prescribed by Sub sections and of Section of the Land Acquisition Act I of The learned Judge noticed that for exercise by the <ORG> of its rule making power under Section there were certain requirements to be fulfilled and formalities to be observed in order that the Rules may acquire the force of law The learned Judge recognised the legal position that a <ORG> Standing Order or an executive direction by the <ORG> cannot be equated to a statutory rule made by the <ORG> under Section Nevertheless the learned Judge took the view that the instructions contained in the and the <ORG> Standing Order had statutory force On these reasonings the learned Judge held that any violation of the instructions contained in the <ORG> Standing Orders would give rise to a cause of action to a person aggrieved and this Court would have jurisdiction to interfere under Article of the Constitution In this view of the matter on the admitted fact that the petitioners were not given individual notices of the acquisition the learned Judge quashed all the proceedings in that case subsequent to the notification under Section of the Act Paragraph in Section contains the relevant instructions that besides publishing the notice as prescribed in Rule the Collector should see that individual notices are served as far as possible on every person known or believed to be interested in the land to be acquired We have not come across any piece of legislation in which <ORG> has been given any powers as respects proceedings or officers under the Land Acquisition Act As for the Land Acquisition Act itself it is quite remarkable that in all its various provisions there is not a single place in which the <ORG> gets so much as a passing mention The authorities exercising powers and functions under the Land Acquisition Act are three in number but <ORG> is not one of them At no point in the evolution of the statute law relating to land acquisition in this country has the <ORG> <ORG> of Revenue figured as an authority entrusted by the statute with any powers or duties or functions connected with compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes The person aggrieved against the <ORG> decision filed a civil suit to set aside the <ORG> orders One of the questions raised in the suit was whether <ORG> had jurisdiction to interfere with the orders passed by the Revenue Divisional Officer and the District Collector under the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act Under the scheme of the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act whenever there was a vacancy to an hereditary office the Collector shall fill up that vacancy and that any dissatisfied claimant shall have the remedy of a suit before the Collector to establish that he had a better right The learned Judge observed as follows The only power which can be claimed by <ORG> is based on Section of <ORG> Regulation I of whereby <ORG> is given authority to superintend and control all persons employed in the executive administration of the public revenue But I am emphatically of opinion that these general powers of superintendence did not authorise <ORG> to arrogate to itself a power of interference in revision or in second appeal from a statutory order when machinery of the statute itself confers no such power The learned Judge further observed thus In my opinion the order of <ORG> purporting to act in second appeal or revision and to decide a matter which according to the machinery of the Act should have been decided by a suit under Section of Act III of was an illegal attempt to invade the vested rights of the plaintiff He relied rather on the order passed by <ORG> in No <ORG> dated th February relevant portions of which we have extracted and set out in an earlier part of this judgment This Gazette Order is published at page of the Manual and is as under Rules have been framed under Section of the Land Acquisition Act prescribing the procedure to be adopted to give full effect to the spirit of the amending Act and these have the force of law i The instructions contained in Part III including No Revenue dated th February are not rules framed by <ORG> in exercise of its powers under Section But under the peculiar terms of Section which <NAME> carefully noted even instructions issued by the <ORG> for the guidance of officers can have validity only if they are promulgated in the form of statutory rules following the procedure and formalities laid down in Section It was contended by <ORG> that the order was purely an administrative direction and it did not confer any justifiable right on the official in question such as could be enforced by the issue of a mandamus by the <ORG> There are administrative orders which confer rights and impose duties We do not think that the above decision of <ORG> on the construction of Service Rules and instructions can have application to a case like the present where the questions are i whether <ORG> can have locus standi to issue guidelines to officers functioning as independent statutory authorities and ii whether the Government could issue rules for guidance otherwise than under Section It was urged before the <ORG> on behalf of the <ORG> that principles of natural justice would not apply to purely administrative decisions The question of the applicability of the rules of natural justices cannot in our opinion be judged de hors the provisions of the statute and this position is made clear by <ORG> in the above passage Our analysis of Section supplemented by reference to the proviso to Section read with Section and to Section A by way of contrast shows that the omission in the Act to provide for individual notices could not have been accidental There are other provisions too such for instance as Sections and which point to the same conclusion It is also clear that the right to object to the acquisition conferred by Section A on the persons interested in the land can be taken away in any case of urgency by the <ORG> making a direction under Section to the effect that the provisions of Section A shall not apply to the land in question The Rule explicitly made provision for hearing by the Collector of the company in question and also of representations from other Departments of <ORG> The rule however contained no provision for any opportunity to be given at that stage to the owners of the land sought to be acquired for the purpose of the company Even though the rule in question was silent regarding the mode of inquiry to be held by the Collector <ORG> yet held that in the interest of fair play the Collector has to observe the principles of natural justice by affording the persons interested in the lands reasonable opportunity of being heard and of adducing material before the Collector to refute the allegations of the company We do not think that the above decision of <ORG> has any application to Section We may refer in this connection to a recent decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> as to the proper approach that a Court of law must take whenever natural justice is invoked for the purpose of supplementing express statutory provisions Reference was also made to the judgment of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> A and in particular to the following passage in that judgment at page Natural Justice requires that the procedure before any <ORG> which is acting judicially shall be fair in all the circumstances For a long time the <ORG> have without objection from <ORG> supplemented procedure laid down in legislation where they have found that to be necessary for this purpose Having ascertained those means effect must be given to those means and to no other The observations were made in a different context while considering a different statutory situation but we feel that they are apposite to the present purpose Under our system of <ORG>ary Government what <ORG> enacts are not policies but means for giving effect to policies The learned Judge had referred in his judgment to two earlier decisions of learned single Judges of this Court both of them unreported <NAME> <NAME> felt that neither decision laid down the law correctly and in that view felt free to differ from them As we shall show presently the views expressed in the two unreported decisions eminently merit acceptance both on principle and on precedent The earlier of the two unreported decisions arose in a case where the owner contended that there was no proper publication of the notification under Section of the Act It was further contended that the property notified for acquisition was under mortgage and the Collector should have given notice personally to the mortgagee Dealing with the latter contention <NAME> <NAME> observed Regarding the contention that there was no proper notice to the petitioner or to <ORG> it has to be mentioned that neither Section nor Section contemplates service of any personal notice on the owner or occupier of the land that is sought to be acquired Elaborating the theme at a later part of the judgment it was observed as follows The plea of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that Section read with Section contemplates service of notices on the person in occupation or interested in the property cannot be accepted for there is no mention of service of any personal notice under Section What is contemplated under Section is that service of any notice under this Act shall be made by delivering or tendering a copy thereof signed in the case of a notice under Section by the officer therein mentioned The proviso to Section states that no person shall enter any building without giving the occupier at least seven days notice in writing of his intention to do so The comment of <NAME> on the above decision is that there was no consideration by the learned Judge of the executive instructions and the Board Standing Orders bearing on the subject of notice under Section We have earlier expressed the view that those instructions have no legal efficacy On the terms of Section the views expressed in the above unreported judgment are those with which we fully agree But there is nothing in the form to suggest that the notice in that form should actually be issued to each and every one of the persons interested in the land It provides that the Collector shall give public notice at convenient places on or near the land to be taken stating that the Government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land may be made to him Sub section provides that in the event of any such person residing elsewhere and having no agent in residence at the locality then the notice will have to be sent to him by registered post addressed to But when such person cannot be found service may be made on any adult male member of his family residing with him and if no such adult male member can be found the notice may be served by affixing the notice on the outer door of the house in which the person therein named ordinarily dwells or carries on business or by affixing a copy thereof in some conspicuous place in the office of the Collector or in the Court house and also in some conspicuous part of the land to be acquired He states that notices under Sections and of the Land Acquisition Act and and were published and served on all the interested persons in accordance with the Statute In so far as the petitioner <NAME> in No of is concerned it is stated that since she was out of Coimbatore the notice under Section was served by affixture We are satisfied that the services of notices under Section read with Section have been validly made on the petitioner on the basis of their own affidavits in support of the writ petitions It was argued that the house in question was not her residence but this cannot be accepted in the face of the admission made by her in the affidavit that whenever she visited Coimbatore she used to stay in the house and a portion in the house was specially reserved for such stay A person can have more than one ordinary residence and service of notice at any one of the residences would be good service under Section read with Section It would be appreciated that the contentions raised by the petitioners are all in the nature of mere procedural wrangles
