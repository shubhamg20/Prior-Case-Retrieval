All these petitioners challenge the applicability of the Act to them on different grounds With regard to the out of work system the trade mark holder issues the beedi leaves and the tobacco to various beedi rollers directly who take the same to their own places roll them into beedies by themselves with the assistance of the members of their family and return the finished products to the trade mark holder When the contract system is adopted there is a possibility of double rejection However some argument has been advanced even with regard to this based on certain alleged peculiar features involved in the working of this system Even in cases where the trade mark holder or the contractor maintains an establishment of his own in which the beedi rollers are collected and where the rolling of the beedies is done the peculiar features are said to be The beedi rollers can come at any time they please and there are no fixed hours for their coming and working and there is no requirement that they should come day after day and engage themselves in rolling beedies since they are paid only on the basis of piece rate and they get wages only for the work they do They may come whenever they like and if they are not inclined to work on any particular day neither the trade mark holder nor the contractor has any power to compel them to come and do the beedi rolling and there is no obligation on their part to be present at the establishment for the purpose of rolling the beedies at any specified time That Court of Enquiry again submitted its report There is yet another report by Mr <NAME> A number of persons who were connected with the beedi industry challenged the validity of that Act and this Court except for striking off the definition of the term employer in Section i of the Madras Act upheld the validity of that Act by that judgment It became necessary therefore to have central legislation on the subject The Act except Section was brought into force in the State of Tamil Nadu with effect from st July and Section itself was notified to come into force with effect from st August On th August the State Government in pursuance of the powers conferred on it by Section of the Act promulgated rules which fixed the rates of licence fees and also set out the circumstances under which alone an employer was entitled to reject beedies which were defective or sub standard and similar other matters The petitioners also prayed for the issue of a writ of mandamus in each case restraining the respondents herein namely <ORG> and the State of Tamil Nadu from enforcing the provisions of the Act against the various petitioners For the purpose of understanding the arguments advanced in support of these writ petitions it is necessary to refer to the salient provisions of the Act Section of the Act defines the various terms and expressions and we are extracting in this judgment the expressions and terms whose definitions have been the subject matter of elaborate argument and dis discussion before us Section contract labour means any person engaged or employed in any premises by or through a contractor with or without the knowledge of the employer in any manufacturing process Section employee means a person employed directly or through any agency whether for wages or not in any establishment to do any work skilled unskilled manual or clerical and includes i any labourer who is given raw materials by an employer or a contractor for being made into beedi or cigar or both at home hereinafter referred to in this Act as home worker and ii any person not employed by an employer or a contractor but working with the permission of or under agreement with the employer or contractor Section employer means a in relation to contract labour the principal employer and in relation to other labour the person who has the ultimate control over the affairs of any establishment or who has by reason of his advancing money supplying goods or other wise a substantial interest in the control of the affairs of any establishment and includes any other person to whom the affairs of the establishment are entrusted whether such other person is called the managing agent manager superintendent or by any other name Section principal employer means a person for whom or on whose behalf any contract labour is engaged or employed in an establishment It is against the background of these provisions an argument was advanced on behalf of the trade mark holders that the trade mark holders cannot be treated as employers with reference to the beedi rollers engaged by their contractors who are actually independent contractors and it is the contractors who alone can be described as employers Section deals with the necessity for applying for a licence the particulars to be mentioned in the application and the matters which should be taken into account by the licensing authority in deciding to grant or refuse the licence applied for Section provides for an appeal against refusal of a licence Section deals with the powers of Inspectors Section deals with cleanliness in the industrial premises while Section deals with the provision for maintenance of such standards of lighting ventilation and temperature as may be prescribed in the industrial premises Sections and deal with the provision of drinking water latrines and urinals and washing facilities respectively in the industrial premises Section deals with notice of periods of work and Section states that the hours of work in the industrial premises should correspond with the notice under Section If an employee is discharged or dismissed from service or quits employment during the course of the year he shall be entitled to leave with wages at the rate laid down in Sub section If any employee does not in any calendar year take the whole of the leave allowed to him under Sub section the leave not taken by him shall be added to the leave to be allowed to him in the succeeding calendar year Provided that the total number of days of leave that may be carried forward to a succeeding year shall not exceed thirty in the case of an adult or forty in the case of a young person If the employment of an employee who is entitled to leave under Sub section is terminated by the employer before he has taken the entire leave to which he is entitled or if having applied for leave he has not been granted such leave or if the employee quits his employment before has taken the leave the employer shall pay him the amount payable under Section in respect of leave not taken and such payment shall be made where the employment of the employee is terminated by the employer before the expiry of the second working day after such termination and where the employee quits his employment on or before the next pay day Section makes some special provisions for the wetting or cutting of beedi or tobacco leaves by the employees while Section deals with onus as to age a The employee discharged dismissed or retrenched may appeal to such authority and within such time as may be prescribed either on the ground that there was no reasonable cause for dispensing with his services or on the ground that he had not been guilty of misconduct as held by the employer or on the ground that such punishment of discharge or dismissal was severe The appellate authority may after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the employer and the employee dismiss the appeal or direct reinstatement of the employee with or without wages for the period during which he was kept out of employment or direct payment of compensation without reinstatement or grant such other relief as it deems fit in the circumstances of the case Section provides for penalty for obstructing an Inspector while Section is a general provision dealing with penalty for offences Sub section of Section is as follows Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act any person who contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule made thereunder or fails to pay wages or compensation in accordance with any order of the appellate authority passed under Clause of Sub section of Section shall be punishable for the first offence with fine which may extend to two hundred and fifty rupees and for a second or any subsequent offence with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one month or more than six months or with fine which shall not be less than one hundred rupees or more than five hundred rupees or with both Section deals with offences by companies Section provides for the application for the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act and the Maternity Benefit Act to every industrial premises under the Act and that section reads Section Section confers upon <ORG> power to make rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act He really did not have any complaint regarding Sections to which deal with the provisions for various amenities in an industrial premises except to point out that some of the provisions are couched in passive voice for example Section states that every industrial premises shall provide such first aid facilities as may be prescribed without indicating as to who should provide such facilities His contention is that the language of Section as well as Section clearly shows that the licence has to be obtained only by the contractor and not by the trade mark holder since the trade mark holder cannot be said to be an employer at all and it is only the contractor who is the employer In particular he drew our attention to Section which refers to the previous experience of the applicant Section refers to the financial resources of the applicant including his financial capacity to meet the demands arising out of the provisions of the law for the time being in force relating to welfare of labour and Section is whether the application is made bona fide on behalf of the applicant himself or benami for any other person With regard to Sections to the contention of the learned Counsel is again the same namely that the industrial premises is maintained only by the contractor and not by the trade mark holder and the obligation is imposed only on the contractor Since he is appearing for the contractor also he challenged the correctness of the applicability of these provisions even to industrial premises by contending that there are no fixed hours of work that the beedi rollers can come at With regard to Sections and which we have extracted already the argument of the learned Counsel is that though Section is in general terms without giving any indication that it applies to home workers Sections and go together and Section expressly makes it applicable to home workers and that both the sections together can have no application to home workers Even with regard to industrial premises the contention of the learned Counsel is that they will have no application since there are no fixed hours of work for beedi rollers to come and work The attack on Section was made based upon the language employed for a period of six months or more by contending that the said section will have no application to domestic workers or home workers since no relationship of master and servant exists between the trade mark holder or contractor on the one hand and the home worker on the other so as to hold that a home worker was employed for a period of six months or more There is nothing which prevents the contractor from taking the raw material and entering into agreement with more than one trade mark holder As a matter of fact <ORG> Madras in I No of by its award dated th November has held It is therefore clear that there is no prohibition against branch managers taking to beedi manufacturing works under other proprietors and it is not likely that this proprietor would have allowed his servants to undertake work from other masters Inasmuch as the contractor can enter into agreements with different trade mark holders a worker is entitled to take his raw material and supply the finished product to different trade mark holders or different contractors A common counter affidavit has been filed in these writ petitions on behalf of the first respondent as well as the second respondent In paragraph of the common counter affidavit filed on behalf of the second respondent it is stated as follows The facts stated by the petitioner in paragraphs to of the affidavit are substantially correct In view of the statement contained in paragraph of the counter affidavit of the second respondent Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the petitioners contended that the facts stated by the petitioners in paragraphs to of their affidavits have been admitted to be correct by the second respondent who alone is the local authority to enforce the Act and this admission would clearly show that the trade mark holders are not employers of the beedi rollers and it is only the independent contractors who can be said to be the employers that no relationship of master and servant exists between the trade mark holders and the beedi rollers and that therefore the various provisions of the Act imposing an obligation on the employers cannot be enforced against the trade mark holders In support of his contention the learned Counsel relied certain well known decisions of <ORG> dealing with the concept of employment and the significance of master and servant relationship <ORG> finally pointed out that the correct method of approach would be to consider whether having regard to the nature of the work there was due control and supervision by the employer and in that context referred to the following observations of <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> <ORG> further pointed out that there is a clear cut distinction between a contractor and a workman and the identifying mark of the latter is that he should be under the control and supervision of the employer in respect of the details of the work Fund Scheme to contract labour and <ORG> held that the said notifications were discriminatory and did not put reasonable restrictions on the right of those employers who employed contract labour to carry on trade or business within Article of the Constitution and therefore must be struck down as unconstitutional <ORG> pointed out that the provisions of the Employees Provident Fund Scheme as amended by the notifications secured the benefits of the Scheme to employees who are employed through contractors but the principal employer was incapable of exercising as against contract labour the right given to him under Para and that it operated unfairly and harshly on persons who employed contract labour and it further resulted in discrimination between those who employed contract labour and those who employed direct labour We are therefore of opinion that Section imposes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioners and is unconstitutional Reliance was also placed on a decision of this Court in Public Prosecutor <NAME> <NAME> There was also the evidence that any worker could leave one factory and take up work in another The circumstance that these workers had to work in the premises of the employer makes no difference As we have pointed out already the argument of Mr <NAME> based on the decisions referred to above is that as the facts stated by the petitioners in paragraphs to of their affidavits are admitted by the second respondent such facts establish that the contractors are independent contractors and therefore there is no relationship of master and servant between the trade mark holders and the beedi rollers The learned Advocate General who appeared for both the respondents in these writ petitions clearly represented to us that the respondents did not want to go back on the averments contained in paragraph of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the second respondent and that they stood by the same Therefore we have to proceed on the basis that the broad features of the systems of manufacture of beedis stated by the petitioners in their affidavits have been admitted by the respondents herein though from the very nature of the case it is impossible to hold that the respondents have admitted all the details contained in the said paragraphs of the affidavits filed on behalf of the petitioners such as the number of contractors engaged by each petitioner or the turnover of beedis of each petitioner etc From the moment of the issue of the beedi leaves and the tobacco to the contractor till they are returned in the form of rolled beedis the interest of the trade mark holder in the raw materials continues and if there is a shortage in the number of beedis rolled with reference to the quantity of beedi leaves and tobacco issued the contractor will certainly be accountable to whom the beedi rollers will be accountable in their turn Taking the nature of the work in the present case it can hardly be said that there must be supervision all the time when beedis are being prepared and unless there is such supervision there can be no direction as to the manner of work The fact that the trade mark holder trusts the contractor and allows him to engage the necessary labour for the rolling of the beedis in the belief that the contractor will not misuse the raw materials issued to him and he in his turn will see that the beedi rollers themselves do not misuse the raw materials will not lead to the inference that the trade mark holder has no right to supervise the actual rolling of the beedis even though he may not choose to exercise that right Another decision of <ORG> in which the facts are much more favourable to the contentions advanced on behalf of the trade mark holders also negatives the case of the petitioners That case arose on a reference made under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act There also the contention that was put forward was that there was no relationship of master and servant between the trade mark holder and the actual rollers of beedis and it was only the independent contractor who was the employer of the beedi rollers A sample agreement between the trade mark holder and the contractor was produced before <ORG> which provided inter alia for the following terms that the proprietor should supply the tobacco and the beedi leave that the intermediary should engage premises of his own and obtain the requisite licence to carry on the work of having the beedis rolled there that at no time should more than nine beedi rollers work in the premises of that intermediary that the intermediary should meet all the incidental charges for rolling the beedis including the cost of thread and the remuneration paid to the beedi rollers that for every unit of beedis rolled and delivered by the inter miediary to the proprietor the latter should pay the stipulated amount after deducting the cost of the tobacco and the beedi leaves supplied by the proprietor that the intermediary should not enter into similar engagement with any other industrial concern that the price of the raw materials and price to be paid for every unit of beedis rolled and delivered were to be fixed at the discretion of the proprietor There is in our opinion little doubt that this system has been evolved to avoid regulations under the Factories Act Further there is also no doubt from whatever terms of agreement are available on the record that the so called independent contractors have really not been independent at all We can therefore see no difficulty in holding that the so called contractor is merely an employee or an agent of the appellants as held by <ORG> and as such employee or agent he employs workers to roll beedis on behalf of the appellants In the present cases we have not got the full terms of the agreement and it is therefore not possible to say that there was no kind of supervision or control over the workers and that the so called independent contractors had to accept all kinds of beedis whether made upto standard or not In the present case there is not even an averment in the affidavits of the petitioners that the raw materials are sold by the petitioners to the contractors We asked the learned Counsel for the petitioners to tell us the actual terms of the arrangement between the trade mark holder and the contractor the quantum of supervision will really depend upon the nature of the work to be performed and having regard to the facts referred to above it cannot be said the petitioners herein have no right of supervision or control over the so called contractors or over the actual beedi rollers Further that decision was rendered with reference to the definition of the term worker in Section of the Factories Act which is narrower in scope than the definition of the term employee in the Act In view of these considerations we are clearly of the opinion that the so called contractors of the trade mark holders are not independent contractors in the sense that the beedi rollers employed by them are their employees and they have nothing whatever to do with the trade mark holders that they are merely agents or representatives of the trade mark holders and that therefore the trade mark holders are the employers with respect to such beedi rollers In each of the affidavits filed in support of Nos and of and No of the petitioner has stated that the petitioner does not employ any worker for the purpose of manufacturing beedis but it is buying beedis at the rate of Rs In view of these statements contained in paragraph of the affidavit we do not see any difference between the cases of these petitioners and other petitioners solely because the petitioners in these cases have stated in paragraph of their affidavits that the firm is buying beedis at the rate of Rs It is significant to note that there is no mention about the sale of raw materials by the trade mark holder to the so called contractors nor the price for which they are sold nor is there any mention as to what happens to those raw materials The petitioner in No of states that for the purpose of securing its turnover of seven lakhs of beedis it has entered into agreements with six contractors who employ their own workmen without any reference of approval from the petitioner firm for the manufacture of beedis that there are three contractors two at Kancheepuram and one at Ranipet that the petitioner firm sells the tobacco and leaves to the independent contractors who manufacture beedis by employing their own workmen and sell them to the petitioner firm that as regards the three other independent contractors at Visharam Timiri and Kaveripakkam a different procedure is adopted in that the petitioner firm supplies the tobacco as well as the leaves to these contractors who in their turn engage workmen for the manufacture of beedis and that to these contractors a lump sum commission is paid every month Here again it is significant to note that there is no reference in the affidavit as to the course which the raw materials undergo in the hands of the contractors and at what price the raw materials are being sold and how the same is realised The fact that a lump sum commission is being paid to three other contractors every month would not also make any difference In the affidavit filed in No of in paragraph the petitioner stated that it sells raw materials to independent contractors against cash payments and finished products are purchased from the independent contractors at rates mutually agreed from time to time by paying cash and that receipts are issued by the petitioner firm for sale of raw materials to the independent contractors In view of the considerations mentioned above we hold that the trade mark holders in these cases will be employers of the beedi rollers and they will have to discharge the obligations imposed on them and it is not open to them to put forward the contention that the so called contractors to whom beedi leaves and tobacco are issued alone are the employers and not the petitioners No such restricted interpretation could be given to Section i In our opinion the definition contained in Section which included the proprietor or the registered user of trade mark is unreasonable and unrelated to the mischief sought to be remedied Except for putting forward a contention that in view of the fact that the contractors are independent contractors the obligation for taking out a licence is cast only on them and not on the trade mark holders and that the language of Section is appropriate only to a contractor and not a trade mark holder no other argument was advanced before us with reference to these two sections We are unable to hold that there is anything in Section of the Act to conclude that the matters enumerated therein would be applicable only to a contractor and not to a trade mark holder Hence we do not see any substance in this argument of Mr <NAME> An appeal is provided under Section against the refusal to grant or renew a licence There is also no criteria laid down for determining what constitutes an establishment and what constitutes an industrial premises Therefore in the absence of a machinery for deciding the dispute whether a particular place or premises is an establishment or an industrial premises or a private dwelling house where business is carried on by the owner or cocupier thereof with the assistance of the members of his family there is scope for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the provisions of the Act In the instant case as we have seen the Act does not provide for giving a notice or an opportunity to make representations and for deciding whether a particular place or premises constitutes an establishment or an industrial premises and the executive authority on its own determination that a place or premises is an industrial premises can enforce the provisions of the Act even in respect of a place or premises which does not fall within the description of an industrial premises In the first place Section requires the person concerned applying for a licence in writing for an industrial premises Section of the Act provides for an appeal to the appellate authority against such order But when the said power is sufficiently controlled by necessary guidance and there are other built in safeguards preventing the abuse of power it would be valid We do not have any doubt whatever that the obligation is imposed on the employer as defined in the Act who will be different persons depending upon whether the case falls under Section a or Section Consequently the only question is if an industrial premises exists whether there is any difficulty in applying or enforcing these provisions whether it is the trade mark holder or the independent contractor who is considered to be the employer in respect of the industrial premises in question The very language of the provisions in question requires the employer to comply with these requirements and there ore whether the employer happens to be a trade mark holder or an independent contractor he will have to comply with the said requirements and there is nothing inherently impossible in giving effect to these statutory requirements Therefore we are unable to agree with the contention advanced on behalf of the petitioners and to hold that these sections are in any way open to challenge It was next contended by Mr <NAME> that these provisions would constitute an unreasonable restriction in excess of the legislative competence under Article of the Constitution of India in so far as it interferes with the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on their business guaranteed by Article There are two answers to this contention The first is certainly these statutory provisions are for the benefit of a large body of workers engaged in the industry and therefore these restrictions are imposed in the interests of the general public as contemplated by Article of the Constitution of India We have already referred to the provisions contained in Section relating to working hours which states that no employee shall be required or allowed to work in any industrial premises for more than nine hours in any day or for more than forty eight hours in any week The proviso to that section contemplates an adult employee being allowed to work in such industrial premises for any period in excess of the limit fixed under that section subject to the payment of overtime wages if the period of work including overtime work does not exceed ten hours in any day and in the aggregate fifty four hours in any week Section equires that the period of work for employees in an industrial premises each day shall be so fixed that no period shall exceed five hours and that no employee shall work for more than five hours before he has had an interval for rest of at least half an hour In the case of home workers there is no question of their being required to work only for a specified number of hours in a day and those hours being spread over and the dwelling house remaining entirely closed on a day in a week Apart from this in our opinion Sections and are unconstitutional even in respect of the employees in industrial premises as constituting unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right of the employees to carry on their business As the language of Section stands now there is absolutely no requirement that any particular employee should have worked for any particular period in a calendar year for getting the benefit of the annual leave with wages A combined leading of Sub sections and of Section will lead to the conclusion that even if an employee has worked for eleven days in a calendar year he would be entitled to a day annual leave with wages The provisions contained in Section of the Act can be usefully compared with Section of the Madras Act which is as follows Section Annual leave with wages Every employee who has worked for a period of not less than days in a beedi industrial premises during a calendar year shall be allowed in the subsequent calendar year leave with wages for a number of days calculated i in the case of an adult at the rate of one day for every twenty days of work performed by him during the previous calendar year ii in the case of a young person at the rate of one day for every fifteen days of work performed by him during the previous calendar year From a comparison of these two sections it is clear that the draftsman of the Act while borrowing the provisions contained in Section of the Madras Act omitted to include the most crucial and important requirement of that section namely an employee should have worked for a period of not less than days during a calendar year Certainly there can be no justification whatever for such a provision and therefore the said provision constitutes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the employers to carry on their business Mr <NAME> also challenged the validity of Section of the Act Section states that <ORG> may permit the wetting or cutting of beedi or tobacco leaves by employees outside the industrial premises on an application made to it by the employer on behalf of such employees In view of the conclusion we have already come to namely that the so called contractors are not really independent contractors and so they are not employers we do not find any difficulty in giving effect to the provision of this sub section There was a faint attack on Section which provides for the application of the Payment of Wages Act to the industrial premises under the Act on Section which provides for the application of the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act and the Maternity Benefit Act to the industrial premises on Section which applied Chapter IV and Section of the Factories Act and on Section which applies the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act to the industrial premises The contention of Mr <NAME> is that the section uses the expression employed for a period of six months or more and since <ORG> has interpreted the word employed as constituting master and servant relationship this section cannot be enforced against the trade mark holders in respect of the beedi rollers engaged by the independent contractors Mr <NAME> pointed out that the trade mark holder might not even be aware of the particular beedi roller employed by the independent contractor and for any failure to comply with the requirement of the section on the part of the independent contractor over whom the trade mark holder had no control the trade mark holder would be made liable and such a vicarious liability could not be imposed on the trade mark holder Section deals with the right to payment of maternity benefit according to which every woman shall be entitled to and her employer shall be liable for the payment of maternity benefit at the rate of the average daily wage for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day The other sections of the Act make ancillary and consequential provisions in so far as the said sub section makes the provisions in the Maternity Benefit Act applicable to such home workers the said provision is invalid and unconstitutional as offending the fundamental right of the employers to carry on their business There is only one other section whose validity has been specifically challenged though not raised in the affidavits Section deals with the powers of Inspectors appointed under the Act and one of the powers enumerated in Section is Subject to any rules made by <ORG> in this behalf an Inspector may within the local limits for which he is appointed enter with such assistants as he thinks fit at all times any place or premises including the residence of employees if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any manufacturing process is being carried on or is ordinarily carried on in any such place or premises There is absolutely nothing in the scheme of the Act to show as to what purpose that clause is intended to achieve in addition to the provisions contained in Sub section of Section Section of the Madras Act is as follows Subject to any rules made in this behalf an Inspector appointed under this Act shall for the purposes of the enforcement of this Act have power to do all or any of the following things within the local limits for which he is appointed to enter at all reasonable times any place or premises including the residences of employees when he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any beedi industry is being carried on or is ordinarily carried on in any such place or premises Thus it will be seen the guidance provided for and the restrictions imposed on the power of entry of the Inspector under Section of the Madras Act are absent in Section of the Act The provisions of the Act contained in Section CO omit the word reasonable and the power is conferred in the widest possible terms enabling the Inspector to enter the premises at all times The said sub section is as follows For the purposes of Clause of Sub section an Inspector may after giving due notice to the employer or in the absence of the employer to the occupier enter the beedi industrial premises with such assistants if any as he thinks fit As we have pointed out already this section is not specifically referred to in the affidavits filed in support of these writ petitions but the question was argued before us and the learned Advocate General having regard to the fact that the question involved was one of construction of the statutory provisions on their language did not object to the question being raised and gone into by this <ORG> For instance the learned Counsel contended that there is no provision in the Act a to compel a worker to work for the minimum of nine hours to compel a worker to work overtime for the period stipulated in the Act to compel him to turn out a minimum rate of production of beedis per day to maintain the quality or standard of work and to maintain good conduct Secondly the Act is binding on all persons concerned and therefore it cannot be contended that when the provisions of the Act are to be enforced there is no obligation on the workmen beedi rollers to comply with the requirement of the statute mentioned above When we pointed this out to the learned Counsel the learned Counsel invited our attention Section of the Act which states The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the terms of any award agreement or contract of service whether made before or after the commencement of this Act Provided that where under any such award agreement contract of service or otherwise an employee is entitled to benefits in respect of any matters which are more favourable to him than those to which he will be entitled under this Act the employee shall continue to be entitled to the more favourable benefits in respect of that matter notwithstanding that he receives benefits in respect of other matters under this Act For these reasons we hold that the mere fact that a particular system was prevalent at the time when the Act came into force is no ground for deciding that the Act did not intend to interfere with that system for the purpose of giving effect to the various provisions it has made According to the petitioners in the award in I No of it was held by <ORG> that there was no prohibition against branch managers to taking beedi manufacturing works under other proprietors and it was not likely that that proprietor would have allowed his servants to undertake from other masters We have already pointed out that in the common counter affidavit filed by the second respondent in all the writ petitions in paragraph thereof while admitting that the facts stated in paragraphs to of the affidavits of the petitioners are substantially correct it is stated that in actual practice the contractor undertook manufacture of beedi only for one factory or trade mark holder Apart from this we have already referred to the fact that the trade mark holders distinguish their respective products with reference to secret mixture of tobacco At least to the extent to which the trade mark holder is interested in seeing that his mixture of tobacco is used only for rolling his beedis and not for rolling the beedis of others he has a right to inspect and supervise the actual manufacturing process itself as indicated by vis already Consequently those two awards will not have any bearing in deciding the question involved in the present case In that writ petition in support of the contention that as between the parties there was only the relationship of master and servant and not buyer and seller as was held by the <ORG> reliance was placed on the decision of <ORG> in Management of <NAME> and Sons Secretary <ORG> Salem and <ORG> While dealing with that contention this <ORG> pointed out the following distinguishing features In the case before <ORG> there was no actual sale and purchase between the parties and the entire thing was one of a matter of adjustment At the time when the manufacturer of the beedis sold leaves and tobacco no purchase price was paid by the vendee and subsequently when the manufactured beedis were re sold the price of the manufactured beedis was fixed and from it a notional price for the leaves and tobacco was deducted leaving the balance as the wages of the workmen and the commission of the agents But in the case before this Court there was no such evidence that if the beedis were not rolled leaves and the tobacco were to be returned to the proprietor But in the case before this Court there was evidence before the <ORG> and the <ORG> also recorded a finding with reference to such evidence that there was fluctuation in the price of leaves and tobacco sold by the first respondent therein to the ten individuals and others In the case before this Court there was no evidence to that effect But on the other hand the <ORG> pointed out that there was no material whatever to show that the first respondent had any control over the ten alleged branch managers and the workmen employed by them In the case before this Court there was evidence to show that the first respondent used to reject some of the beedis produced by the ten individuals and once they were rejected they were at liberty to sell these beedis to anybody they liked In the case before <ORG> great reliance was placed on the impecunious nature of the so called independent contractors while in the case before this Court there was evidence to show that these ten individuals who were called branch managers paid for tobacco and leaves purchased by him and according to the evidence placed before the <ORG> the quantity of the leaves and tobacco purchased by them depended upon the availability of cash with them In support of this contention in paragraph A of the affidavits filed in support of the writ petitions the petitioners have given some figures as to what would be the cost of liability on the petitioners in respect of the construction of latrines or urinals construction of washing facilities and supply of first aid boxes and according to them the same would be in the region of Rs Mr <NAME> contended that if the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the second respondent had questioned the correctness of the figures the petitioners would have placed necessary materials to establish their case before this <ORG> There is absolutely nothing to show that if the petitioners were to incur additional expenses by way of providing facilities which are meant for the benefit of the employees they will not be able to recoup the same by raising the selling price of the beedis manufactured by them Simply because the petitioners will have to incur additional expenses for providing benefits to the employees which are admittedly in the interest of the general public it cannot be contended that the provisions of the Act are violative of the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on their business or they are in excess of the permissible limits under Article of the Constitution They further held that Section and Sections and would not apply to employees in industrial premises who do not voluntarily choose to work for the full hours of work notified under Section read with Section of the Act on all the days or the requisite number of days As far as clauses a and are concerned <ORG> proceeded on the basis that the contractor was an independent contractor and the provisions of the Act logically taken to their conclusions meant that the principal employer was made liable civilly as well as criminally in respect of every facility that was made available to all the employees including the workers and even when therefore a genuine case of a contractor existed and that contractor having received full payment from the principal employer failed to make payments to his employee it would amount to principal employer not making payment or failing to make payment of wages and he might have to face a litigation before <ORG> as that Act is made applicable to this industry by Section of the Act and he would further be liable to be prosecuted under Section of the Act and that if such a performance was repeated twice not by the same contractor but by two contractors independently it would be a second offence of the principal employer We have already expressed our opinion that the contractors involved in these writ petitions are not really independent contractors We have also referred to the circumstances under which a person other than the trade mark holder can be held to be an employer for the purpose of the provisions of the Act That is a judgment of a single Judge and there are no detailed discussions in the judgment and the major portion of the decision is based upon concessions made before the Court Having regard to this conflict between the various decisions brought to our notice we have approached the question independently based on the pleadings before us the language in the statutory provisions and the history behind the same We have further held that Section and Section will have no application to a home worker In this context it is relevant to extract the following portion from the Report of the Committee which investigated into the conditions of <ORG> under the chairmanship of Mr <NAME> I appointed by <ORG> in to which we have made a reference already To conclude matters requiring immediate attention in the beedi and cigar industries are the unhealthy working conditions long hours of work employment of women and children deduction from wages and the subcontract system of organisation However these are not matters with which we are concerned at present and we are called upon only to interpret the provisions of the Act and decide their constitutional validity Apart from the fact that the decision of <ORG> of Andhra Pradesh is under appeal to <ORG> and we ourselves have taken the view that Sections and of the Act are valid and legal it cannot be said that simply because one <ORG> has held that a certain provision of the Central enactment is ultra vires or invalid it automatically ceases to apply to the territories other than those within the jurisdiction of that particular <ORG> The decision of <ORG> of Andhra Pradesh with regard to Sections and has not been concurred with by <ORG> of Mysore in the decision referred to already and we ourselves have taken a different view Then again there is a decision of <ORG> of Gujarat upholding the validity of the entire Act Then there remains the writ petitions filed by the manufacturers of cigars and cigar rollers The case of the manufacturers of cigars as set out in the affidavits filed in support of their writ petitions can be briefly stated as follows The manufacturers employ persons rolling cigars in their own premises these persons are being assisted by some other persons brought by the rollers called helpers in addition the manufacturer engages certain employees for the purpose of stripping and splitting the mid ribs of tobacco leaves and certain others in the process of affixing ring labels to the finished goods and the persons in the process of stripping and splitting and those engaged in affixing ring labels take away the materials to their own homes for doing the particular process for which they have been engaged Paragraphs to of the affidavit filed in No of deal with the manufacturing process The facts stated by them are also the same as stated in the affidavit filed by the petitioner in No of The first is there are no fixed hours during which a cigar roller is required to work Apart from these three factors reliance has also been placed upon a number of awards of <ORG> namely the award of <ORG> Madras in I No of the award of <ORG> Madurai in I No of the award of <ORG> in I No of the award of <ORG> Madras in I No of and the award of <ORG> Madurai in I No of in each one of which it was held that there was no relationship of master and servant between the cigar manufacturer and the cigar roller Reliance has also been placed on the decision of this Court <NAME> in Public Prosecutor <NAME> We have already referred to the decision of <NAME> mentioned above Consequently we proceed to examine the question only on the basis of the pleadings We have already referred to the circumstances relied on in support of the contention that the relationship of master and servant does not exist between the cigar manufacturer and the cigar roller It may be that there are no fixed hours for each worker to work in the manufacturing premises As we have already pointed out the number of cigars taken out for this purpose will have to be retable to the number of hours a worker is able to spare in the house and therefore the general argument advanced with regard to home workers in beedi industry is not available to the case of these workers in cigar industry Further in the affidavit filed by the petitioner in No of it is stated that the petitioner firm engages about persons for the purpose of stripping and splitting the mid ribs of tobacco leaves and about persons in the process of affixing the ring labels to the There is no averment whatever in the affidavit that those persons and persons need not by themselves do the work for which they are engaged and they can have the work done by somebody else when they take the leaves and rolled cigars to their respective houses Consequently there are no materials before us to hold that such persons are independent contractors and not employees of the cigar manufacturers But in our opinion this is no ground for holding that the provisions of the Act cannot be applied to the industrial premises because in such an event what an experienced worker was previously getting is shared between him and the helper who himself becomes an employee in his individual right and such a circumstance is not sufficient to invalidate the provisions of the Act In paragraphs and of the affidavit filed in support of No of the petitioner has given some figures as to the liability he will have to incur by implementing the provisions of the Act by way of providing facilities referred to for the industrial premises and by way of giving holidays with wages to the workers concerned No case has been put forward in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition nor any fact which emerges from any of the decided cases was brought to our notice showing that such domestic workers are not continuously employed or they are incapable of being continuously employed for a period of six months and more as contemplated by Section
