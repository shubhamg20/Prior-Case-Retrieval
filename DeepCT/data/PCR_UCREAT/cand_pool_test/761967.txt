He submitted his final report by the end of appellant came up to <ORG> by special leave It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the Act laid down two distinct and separate procedures one for investigation and the other for settlement and it was the former alone and not the latter that was affected by the decisions of this <ORG> and that the appellant by voluntarily entering into the settlement had waived his fundamental right founded on Art Of the Constitution and it was not correct to contend that the appellant had by entering into the settlement under A of the Act waived his fundamental right under that Article but also of any other fundamental right guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution The Constitution made no distinction between fundamental rights enacted for the benefit of the individual and those enacted in the public interest or on grounds of the public policy Since the arguments in the instant case had covered the entire field of fundamental rights there was no reason why the answer should be confined to Art Per <NAME> It seems clear that Art itself re cognises the distinction between absence of legislative power which will make the law made by an incompetent legislature wholly void and exercise of legislative power in contravention of a restriction or check on such power which will make the law void to the extent of the inconsistency or contravention therefore the mere use of the word void in Art does not necessarily militate against the application of the doctrine of waiver in respect of the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution There was nothing in the two preambles to the Indian and the American Constitutions that could make the doctrine of waiver applicable to the one and not to the other since the doctrine applied to the constitutional rights under the American Constitution there is no reason why it should not apply to the fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution But it must be made clear that there is no absolute rule or one formulated in the abstract as to the applicability of that doctrine to fundamental rights and such applicability must depend on the nature of fundamental right to which it is sought to be applied and the foundation on the basis of which the plea is raised This Act which came into force on May by a notification issued by <ORG> under thereof has had a short but chequered career as will appear from the facts hereinafter stated The Central Government may at any time before the th day of June refer to the <ORG> for investigation and report any case or points in a case in which <ORG> has prima facie reasons for believing that a person has to a substantial extent evaded payment of taxation on income together with such material as may be available in support of such belief and may at any time before the th day of June apply to the <ORG> for the withdrawal of any case or points in a case thus referred and if the <ORG> approves of the withdrawal no further proceedings shall thereafter be taken by or before the <ORG> in respect of the case or points so withdrawn The <ORG> may after examining the material submitted by <ORG> with reference to any case or points in a case and making such investigation as it considers necessary report to <ORG> that in its opinion further investigation is not likely to reveal any substantial evasion of taxation on income and on such report being made the investigation shall be deemed to be closed No reference made by <ORG> under sub section at any time before the th day of June shall be called in question nor shall the sufficiency of the material on which such a reference has been made be investigated in any manner by any Court If in the course of investigation into any case or points in a case referred to it under sub section the <ORG> has reason to believe a that some person other than the person whose case is being investigated has evaded payment of taxation on income or that some points other than those referred to it by <ORG> in respect of any case also require investigation it may make a report to <ORG> stating its reasons for such belief and on receipt of such report <ORG> shall notwithstanding anything contained in sub section forthwith refer to the <ORG> for investigation the case of such other person or such additional points as may be indicated in that report Save as otherwise provided in this Act the materials brought on record shall be considered by all the three members of the <ORG> sitting together and the report of the <ORG> shall be in accordance with the opinion of the majority After considering the report <ORG> shall by order in writing direct that such proceedings as it thinks fit under the Indian Income Tax Act the Excess Profits Tax Act or any other law shall be taken against the person to whose case the report relates in respect of the income of any period commencing after the st day of December and upon such a direction being given such proceedings may be taken and completed under the appropriate law notwithstanding the restrictions contained in section of the Indian Income Tax Act or section of the Excess Profits Tax Act or any other law and notwithstanding any lapse of time or any decision to a different effect given in the case by any Income tax authority or <ORG> Section barred the jurisdiction of Courts to call in question any act or proceeding of the <ORG> or any authorised official appointed under Section gave power to <ORG> to make rules by notification in the official gazette Under section of the Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act the cases of the following persons are hereby referred to <ORG> for investigation and report as <ORG> has prima facie reasons for believing that each such person has either alone or in combination with the other persons mentioned below evaded payment of taxation on income to a substantial extent Settlement of cases under investigation Where any Person concerned in any case referred to or pending before the <ORG> for investigation applies to the <ORG> at any time during such investigation to have the case or any part thereof settled in so far as it relates to him the <ORG> shall if it is of opinion that the terms of the settlement contained in the application may be approved refer the matter to <ORG> and if <ORG> accepts the terms of such settlement the <ORG> shall have the terms thereof recorded and thereupon the investigation in so far as it relates to matters covered by such settlement shall be deemed to be closed For the purpose of enforcing the terms of any settlement arrived at in pursuance of sub section <ORG> may direct that such proceedings as may be appropriate under the Indian Income tax Act XI of the Excess Profits Tax Act XV of or any other law may be taken against the person to whom the settlement relates and in particular the provisions of the second proviso to clause a of sub section of section section the proviso to sub section of section A the proviso to subjection of section and sections and of the Indian Income tax Act shall be applicable to the recovery of any sum specified in such settlement by the Income Tax Officer having jurisdiction to assess the person by whom such sum is payable as if it were income tax or an arrear of income tax within the meaning of those provisions Subject to the provisions of sub section of section any settlement arrived at under this section shall be conclusive as to the matters stated therein and no person whose case has been so settled be entitled to re open in any proceeding for the recovery of any sum under this section or in any subsequent assessment or reassessment proceeding relating to taxation on income or in any other proceeding before any <ORG> or other authority any matter which forms part of such settlement Our Constitution came into force on January On January notice was issued to the assessee to appear before the <ORG> on February After the evidence was closed notice was issued to the assessee on May asking him to appear before the <ORG> on May Learned counsel for the assessee states that at the close of the arguments on May the <ORG> announced its view that the income profits and gains that had escaped assessment in the hands of the assessee for the period beginning with April and ending March were the sum of Rs of the Constitution asking for an appropriate writ restraining the <ORG> from taking any action on the ground that the provisions of the Investigation Act had become void being discriminatory in character By that judgment this Court held that both of the Indian Income Tax Act as it then stood and sub of of the Investigation Act dealt with persons who had similar characteristics of being persons who had not truly disclosed their income and had evaded payment of tax on their income but that as the procedure prescribed by the Investigation Act was substantially more prejudicial than the procedure under the Indian Income Tax Act sub of and the procedure prescribed by the Investigation Act in so far as it affected persons proceeded against under that sub section was a piece of discriminatory legislation which offended the provisions of Art Paradoxical as it may seem the result of this amendment was that persons who originally fell only within the ambit of of the Investigation Act and formed a distinct class of substantial tax evaders also came within the amended of the Indian Income Tax Act Indian Income Tax Act be taken against that assessee with a view to assess or re assess the income which had escaped assessment for the period to In regard to the assessment orders which had been served the assessee concerned applied to the <ORG>er of Income Tax under of the Investigation Act for reference to <ORG> on questions of law arising out of those re assessment orders The majority of this Court held that different persons though falling under the same class or category of substantial evaders of income tax were being subjected to different procedures one a summary and drastic procedure and the other the normal procedure which gave to the assessees various rights which were denied to those who were specially treated under the procedure prescribed by the Investigation Act and therefore the assessments made under were void and unenforceable The assessee appellant before us who had at the end of the investigation entered into a settlement and been assessed in accordance with the terms of such settlement however went on making payments in discharge of the balance due under the terms of settlement right up to September when he made the last payment of <ORG> Being aggrieved by the above decision the assessee thereupon moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal against that order In view of the three decisions referred to above learned Attorney General does not seriously contend that the powers conferred on the <ORG> by and the procedure laid down by of the Investigation Act are not discriminatory but what he urges is that none of the said decisions has held that is wholly void and inoperative If the first procedure is followed and an assessment is made under such assessment will undoubtedly be invalid as has been held in <NAME> case but if on a case being referred the settlement procedure is followed then the consequential order of assessment under A cannot be questioned It will be recalled that when the case of the assessee was referred to the <ORG> under on July there was no provision for settlement in the Act at all It is true that there was nothing to prevent the assessee from straightaway For the purpose of satisfying itself the <ORG> had obviously to go into the facts either by itself or through an authorised official and to consider the materials collected by the authorised official and in the process of doing so had to hold an investigation of some sort and that investigation had neces sarily to be made in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Investigation Act itself In recording the compromise and passing a judgment in accordance with the compromise thereof the court exercises the same jurisdiction as it exercises in entertaining and disposing of the suit itself Learned Attorney General then points out that the Investigation Act was a pre Constitution Act and that before the commencement of the Constitution when there was no such thing as a fundamental right its provisions could not be questioned however discriminatory the procedure may have been In our judgement those observations have no application to the facts of the present appeal before us for here even after the commencement of the Constitution the process of investigation continued in that the authorised official went on collecting materials by following the procedure prescribed by and exercising the powers conferred on him by of the Investigation Act Immediately two questions arise for consideration namely whether the assessee could waive the breach of the fundamental right in question and whether in the facts and circumstances of this case he had actually done so The answer to it depends on two considerations firstly does the constitutional prohibition which has been infringed affect the competence of the <ORG> to enact the law or does it merely operate as a check on the exercise of a power which is within its competence and secondly if it is merely a check whether it is enacted for the benefit of individuals or whether it is imposed for the benefit of the general public on grounds of public policy That would also be the position when a limitation is imposed on the legislative power in the interests of the public as for instance the provisions in Chapter XIII of the Constitution relating to inter <ORG> trade and commerce The rights guaranteed under Art are enacted for the benefit of owners of properties and when a law is found to infringe that provision it is open to any person whose rights have been infringed to waive it and when there is waiver there is no legal impediment to the enforcement of the law Without finally expressing an opinion on this question we are not for the moment convinced that this theory has any relevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of our Constitution They have been put there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no application to provisions of law which have been enacted as a matter of constitutional policy On that occasion one of us preferred not to express any opinion on this subject and said at page In coming to the conclusion that I have I have in a large measure found myself in agreement with the views of <NAME> on that part of the case On those topics I prefer to express no opinion on this occasion It will however be noticed that the observations of the learned judges made in that case did not relate to the waiver of a breach of the fundamental right under Art We take the view that this court should not make any pronouncement on any question which is not strictly necessary for the disposal of the particular case before it We therefore confine our attention to Art Article runs as follows The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India of this Article prohibits the <ORG> from making any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by the same Part and follows it up by saying that any law made in contravention of this clause Shall to the extent of the contravention be void Said his Lordship at page that in accordance with British jurisprudence no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except when be can support the legality of his act before a court of justice That apart the very language of Art It seems to us absolutely clear on the language of Art that it is a command issued by the Constitution to the <ORG> as a matter of public policy with a view to implement its object of ensuring the equality of status and opportunity which every welfare <ORG> such as India is by her Constitution expected to do and no person can by any act or conduct relieve the <ORG> of the solemn obligation imposed on it by the Constitution They have no bearing on the question of the waiver of the equal protection clause of the th Amendment which like our Art was not a fundamental right conferred by Part III it could not be enforced under Art conferred merely a privilege and that such privilege could always be waived It was overlooked that if a person volun tarily answered any question then there was no breach of his fundamental right at all for the fundamental right is that a person shall not be compelled to incriminate himself The appeal is against the order of the income tax authorities which order makes no reference to the plea of waiver The view taken on question however relieves us of the necessity of going into this question we have no doubt in our mind that it is not for a citizen or any other person who benefits by reason of its provisons to waive any breach of the obligation on the part of the <ORG> <NAME> I agree with the reasoning adopted and the conclusion reached in the judgments prepared by My Lord the Chief Justice and my brother <NAME> in regard to the ultra vires character of the proceedings adopted under A of the Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act and the void character of the settlement reached thereunder As regards the parts of the judgments which deal with the question whether a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution can be waived at all I find myself in agreement with the judgment prepared by my brother <NAME> and am of the opinion that it is not open to a citizen to waive the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution If the proceedings and the settlement under section A of the Act were void as aforesaid the respondent contended that the appellant had waived the fundamental right enshrined in Art This was only by way of reply to the contention of the appellant and was not set out in proper details in any affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent No objection was taken by either of the parties before us to the issue of waiver being decided on such materials and the question was argued at considerable length before us We therefore see no reason why we should refrain from pronouncing our opinion on that question But unless and until we find the limitations on such fundamental rights enacted in the very provisions of the Constitution there is no justification whatever for importing any notions from the United States of America or the authority of cases decided by <ORG> there in order to whittle down the plenitude of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of our Constitution The genesis of the declaration of fundamental rights in our Constitution can be traced to the following passage from the Report of the Nehru Committee Canada Australia and South Africa have no declaration of rights in their Constitutions but there are various articles to be found in the Constitution of the Irish Free State which may properly be grouped under the general head fundamental rights The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void to include Laws passed or made by a <ORG> or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas and they were declared void in so far as they were inconsistent with the provisions of this Part to the extent of such inconsistency was enjoined not to make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in con travention of this clause was to the extent of the contravention declared void an admonition was administered to the <ORG> not to enact any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and the obligation thus imposed on the <ORG> enured for the benefit of all citizens of Bharat alike in respect of all the fundamental rights enacted in Part III of the Constitution To borrow the words of My Lord the Chief Justice In the face of such unequivocal admonition administered by the Constitution which is the supreme law of the land is it open to the <ORG> to disobey the Constitutional mandate merely because a citizen told the <ORG> that it may do so if the Constitution asks the <ORG> as to why the <ORG> did not carry out its behest will it be any answer for the <ORG> to make that True you directed me not to take away or abridge the rights conferred by this Part but this citizen said that I could do so for he had no objection to my doing so and no distinction can be made at all between the fundamental rights enacted for the benefit of the individual and those enacted in the public interest or on grounds of public policy What then is the basis of this distinction which has be strenuously urged before us that there are certain fundamental rights which are enacted only for the private benefit of a citizen rights of property which can be waived by him and there are other fundamental rights enacted for the public good or as a matter of public policy which it would not be open to a citizen to waive even though he were affected by the breach thereof There is nothing in the terms of the various articles embodying the fundamental rights in Part III of our Constitution which warrants such a distinction Such constitutional limitations are to be found within the terms of the articles themselves and there is no justification for reading in the terms of the articles anything more than what is expressly stated therein There is further this distinction between the American Constitution and ours that whereas the American Constitution was merely enacted in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty and was an outline of government and nothing more our Constitution was There is some need of protecting personal liberty against governmental power and also some need of limiting personal liberty by governmental power There is no difficulty whatever in working out this position and to my mind the difficulties pointed out of the Constitution he would be promptly confronted with the argument that the <ORG> should in the exercise of its discretion refuse him the relief prayed for Even then he might merely obtain a relief declaring the legislation ultra vires the Constitution and the <ORG> would not grant him any consequential relief For that relief he would have to approach the regular courts of law when all questions of law apart from the mere constitutionality of the provision would be considered by the <ORG> on a contest between the par They have been put there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no application to provisions of law which have been enacted as a matter of constitutional policy <NAME> is an appeal by special leave from an order dated January passed by the Commissioner of Income tax Delhi respondent no before us in circumstances which are somewhat unusual and out of the ordinary We have therefore proceeded on the footing that the present appeal is competent and have considered it unnecessary to decide in the abstract the more general question as to the circumstances in which an order made by a revenue authority like the Commissioner of Income tax partakes of the character of A judicial or quasi judicial order The Act received the assent of the Governor General on April and came into force on May The reference was made under of the Act and it stated that the Central Government had prima facie reasons for believing that the assessee either alone or in combination with other persons evaded payment of taxation on income to a substantial extent and therefore the case of the asseesee was sent to <ORG> for investigation and report In the circumstances we consider it proper to allow the assessee the benefit of a settlement on the lower concessional basis of of evaded income payable by way of tax and a moderate penalty of Rs The assessee accepting our findings both as regards the amount of income that escaped assessment and the amount of tax and penalty payable offered a settlement On December the assessee filed a petition to the Income tax Commissioner Delhi in which after stating the relevant facts the assessee claimed that after the decision in <NAME> case the settlement made under A of the Act had no force and was not binding on him the assessee then prayed that the attached properties should be released from attachment and the amounts recovered under the terms of settlement refunded to him The assessee asked for and obtained special leave from this Court on February to appeal from the aforesaid order In the appeal as orginally filed in pursuance of the special leave granted to the assessee the prayer portion was inadvertently left out On behalf of the respondents the learned Attorney General has contended that there is no decision of this Court which has held that of the Act is wholly void and on a proper construction of the various sections of the Act it will be found that there are two separate and distinct procedures or jurisdictions which <ORG> may follow or exercise one is investigation and the other relates to settlement He has submitted that the jurisdiction conferred on <ORG> under A which was inserted in the Act in by of Act of is not affected by the decision in <NAME> case and if <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain an application from the assessee for settlement approve of the same and refer it to <ORG> the latter had also jurisdiction to accept it under sub and make necessary orders under sub of A In short the argument of the learned Attorney General is that there is nothing in <NAME> decision which renders A constitutionally invalid We have said that the Act came into force on May <ORG> whose duties shall be to quote the words of the section a to investigate and report to <ORG> on all matters relating to taxation on income with particular reference to the extent to which the existing law relating to and procedure for the assessment and collection of such taxation is adequate to prevent the evasion thereof to investigate in accordance with the provisions of this Act any case or point in a case referred to it under section and make a report thereon including such interim reports as the <ORG> may think fit to <ORG> in respect of all or any of the assessments made in relation to the case before the date of its report or interim report as the case may be Section deals with the composition of the <ORG> details whereof are unnecessary for our purpose Sub sections and of are relevant to the problems before us and must be read The Central Government may at any time before the st day of September refer to the <ORG> for investigation and report any case or points in a case in which the Central Government has prima facie reasons for believing that a person has to a substantial extent evaded payment of taxation on income together with such material as may be available in support of such belief and may at any time before the st day of September apply to the <ORG> for the withdrawal of any case or points in a case thus referred and if the <ORG> approves of the withdrawal no further proceedings shall thereafter be taken by or before the <ORG> in respect of the case or points so withdrawn The <ORG> may after examining the material submitted by <ORG> with reference to any case or points in a case and making such investigation as it considers necessary report to <ORG> that in its opinion further investigation is not likely to reveal any substantial evasion of taxation on income and on such report being made the investigation shall be deemed to be closed If in the course of investigation into any case or points in a case referred to it under sub section the <ORG> has reason to believe a that some person other than the person whose case is being investigated has evaded payment of taxation on income or that some points other than those referred to it by <ORG> in respect of any case also require investigation it may make a report to <ORG> stating its reasons for such belief and on receipt of such report <ORG> shall notwithstanding anything contained in sub section forthwith refer to the <ORG> for investigation the case of such other person or such additional points as may be indicated in that report Section states the powers of the <ORG> and they may be summarised thus a the <ORG> has power to require any person or banking or other Company to give information on relevant points it has power to administer oaths and all the powers of a civil court to take evidence enforce the attendance of witnesses etc it has power to impound and retain a document in its custody it has power to ask an authorised official to examine accounts and interrogate any person it has power to give directions to an authorised official it has power to close the investigation and make a best of judgment assessment in respect of a person who refuses or fails to attend in person to give evidence or produce documents etc and it has power of seizure search etc and whereof need only be referred to here In making an investigation under clause of section the <ORG> shall act in accordance with the principles of natural justice shall follow as far as practicable the principles of the Indian Evidence Act and shall give the person whose case is being investigated a reasonable opportunity of rebutting any evidence adduced against him and the power of the <ORG> to compel production of documents shall not be subject to the limitation imposed by section of the Indian Evidence Act and the <ORG> shall be deemed to be a court and its proceedings legal proceedings for the purpose of sections and of the Bankers Books Evidence Act XVIII of No person shall be entitled to inspect call for or obtain copies of any documents statements or papers or materials furnished to obtained by or produced before the <ORG> or any authorised official in any proceedings under this Act but the <ORG> and after the <ORG> has ceased to exist such authority as the Central Government may in this behalf appoint may in its discretion allow such inspection and furnish such copies to any person Provided that for the purpose of enabling the person whose case or points in whose case is or are being investigated to rebut any evidence brought on the record against him he shall on application made in this behalf and on payment of such fees as may be prescribed by Rules made under this Act be furnished with certified copies of documents statements papers and materials brought on the record by <ORG> In any proceedings under this Act the <ORG> may in its discretion admit in evidence and act upon any document notwithstanding that it is not duly stamped or registered Section states in effect what the <ORG> shall do on the conclusion of the investigation it states that the materials brought on the record shall be considered by all the members and the report shall be in accordance with the opinion of the majority A Where any person concerned in any case referred to or pending before the <ORG> for investigation applies to the <ORG> at any time during such investigation to have the case or any part thereof settled in so far as it relates to him the <ORG> shall if it is of opinion that the terms of the settlement contained in the application may be approved refer the matter to <ORG> and if <ORG> accepts the terms of such settlement the <ORG> shall have the terms thereof recorded and thereupon the investigation in so far as it relates to matters covered by such settlement shall be deemed to be closed For the purpose of enforcing the terms of any settlement arrived at in pursuance of subsection <ORG> may direct that such proceedings as may be appropriate under the Indian Income tax Act XI of the Excess Profits Tax Act XV of or any other law may be taken against the person to whom the settlement relates and in particular the provisions of the second proviso to clause Subject to the provisions of subsection of section any settlement arrived at under this section shall be conclusive as to the matters stated therein and no person whose case has been so settled shall be entitled to reopen in any proceeding for the recovery of any sum under this section or in any subsequent assesssment or reassessment proceeding relating to taxation on income or in any other proceeding before any court or other authority any matter which forms part of such settlement Section bars the jurisdiction of courts but it is not disputed that if any of the provisions of the Act are ultra vires the Constitution will neither cure the defect nor stand in the way of the assessee Section the last section gives <ORG> power to make rules of of the Act and the procedure prescribed by the Act in so far as it affected the persons proceeded against under that sub section were held to be discriminatory and therefore void and unenforceable On December the assessees filed their writ petitions challenging the constitutionality of of the Act It was held by the majority that was discriminatory and violative of the fundamental right guaranteed under Art The ratio of the decision was thus explained in the majority judgment at page After the th September there were two procedures simultaneously in operation the one under Act XXX of and the other under the Indian Income tax Act with reference to persons who fell within the same class or category viz Different persons though falling under the same class or category of substantial evaders of income tax would therefore be subject to different procedures one a summary and drastic procedure and the other a normal procedure which gave to the assessees various rights which were denied to those who were specially treated under the procedure prescribed in Act XXX of When however the Constitution came into force on the th January the citizens obtained the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution including the right to equality of laws and equal protection of laws enacted in article thereof and whatever may have been the position before January it was open to the persons alleged to belong to the class of substantial evaders thereafter to ask as to why some of them were subjected to the summary and drastic procedure prescribed in Act XXX of and others were subjected to the normal procedure prescribed in section and the cognate sections of the Indian Income tax Act the procedure prescribed in Act XXX of being obviously discriminatory and therefore violative of the fundamental right guaranteed under article of the Constitution We do not propose to cover the same ground again but cop tent ourselves with drawing attention to what was pointedly said in <ORG> case namely that it was conceded on behalf of Government that the procedure prescribed by the impugned Act in ss and which we have read earlier was more drastic than the procedure prescribed in ss and of the Indian Income tax Act It was stated therein that though in the first stages of investigation there was some similarity between the two procedures the overall picture was not the same The learned Attorney General has not seriously contested the correctness of this position but has argued that what we are concerned with in the present case is not the mere possibility of a differential treatment but what actually was done by the <ORG> in the case of the present assessee after January In our view the ratio of the majority decision in <NAME> case has no application in the case under our consideration and the principle which applies is what was laid down in <NAME> case The majority decision is <NAME> case proceeded on the finding to quote the words of <NAME> who delivered the majority judgment that although there were deviations in certain particulars It is necessary to explain here why we cannot accept the contention of the learned Attorney General that there are two procedures or two jurisdictions under the Act What in substance is the effect of the provisions of the Act in so far as they relate to the <ORG> duty under The <ORG> receives a reference under if it does not proceed under it exercises such of its powers under as it considers necessary It then follows the procedure laid down in and submits its report under That is exactly what was done in the present case He then submitted a final report On May after the assessee knew what the final finding of the <ORG> was going to be he filed an application for settlement It is difficult to understand how in the circumstances stated above it can be said that the <ORG> followed a non discriminatory procedure or that it had two jurisdictions one relating to investigation and the other to settlement Then he made an application for settlement which was approved by the <ORG> under A This brings me to the second question that of waiver of a fundamental right which is as important as it is complex We have however heard full arguments on it and proceed to consider it on such materials as have been placed before us On behalf of the respondents it has been submitted that assuming without conceding that the discriminatory provisions of the Act were applied in the case of the assessee before he asked for a settlement the materials on record show that he never objected to the procedure adopted voluntarily asked for a settlement got by the settlement the benefit Payments made up to April Payment made on OOO The learned Attorney General has in this connection referred us to the application for settlement which the assessee had made to the <ORG> wherein the following statements were made in view of the fact that though no disclosure statement had been made before the submission of his reports by the authorised official still during the enquiry before the <ORG> the assessee and his auditors admitted their liability to tax in respect of the aforesaid sum of Rs The assessee accepts the conclusions of the <ORG> as regards the amount of income that escaped assessment the tax payable thereon and the penalty payable as aforesaid On the basis of these statements the learned Attorney General has argued that there is no foundation for the suggestion made on behalf of the assessee that the application for settlement was made under the pressure of circumstances and in view of the coercive machinery of the Act In <NAME> case the argument urged was inter alia that ss and of the Act were invalid and ultra vires as they contravened the provisions of Arts and of the Constitution and the prayer made was that the entire proceedings should be quashed as also all orders made by <ORG> in pursuance of the settlement under A In rejecting the argument and prayer <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Court said at In this situation unless and until the petitioner can establish that his consent was improperly procured and that he is not bound thereby he cannot complain that any of his fundamental rights has been contravened for which he can claim relief under art It seems to me that the decision proceeded more upon the scope of Art is not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution it could not be enforced under Article In view of this decision it has to be held that the petition under Article is not maintainable in the situation that has arisen and that even otherwise in the peculiar circumstances that have arisen it would not be just and proper to direct the issue of any of the writs the issue of which is discretionary with this <ORG> Here again there is no reference to the doctrine of waiver and the case was decided on the ambit and scope of Art Indeed it is true that the assessee submitted to the discriminatory procedure applied to him by the <ORG> he also asked for a settlement under which he agreed to pay of his alleged tax liability and a small amount of penalty he made some payment in instalments even after <NAME> decision in December In his application for a settlement he said clearly in paragraph that the <ORG> announced it as its view that the income profits and gains that had escaped assessment in the hands of the assessee was Rs Waiver differs from estoppel in the sense that it is contractual and is an agreement to release or not to assert a right estoppel is a rule of evidence I do not think that the maxim ignorance of law is no excuse can be carried to the extent of saying that every person must be presumed to know that a piece of legislation enacted by a legislature of competent jurisdiction must be held to be invalid in case it prescribes a differential treatment and he must therefore refuse to submit to it or incur the peril of the bar of waiver being raised against him On the contrary the presumption if any which operated at the relevant time was the presumption that a law passed by a competent legislature is valid unless declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction I greatly regret to have to say that I have come to a conclusion different from theirs with regard to this question and as they have thought fit to express their views on it proceed now to explain why I have come to a conclusion different from those of my learned brethren on this question The view which <NAME> expressed was this if the constitutional provision which has been infringed affects the competence of the legislature which passed the law the law is a nullity as for example when a State enacts a law which is within the exclusive competence of the <ORG> when however a law is within the competence of the legislature which passed it and the unconstitutionality arises by reason of its repugnancy to provisions enacted for the benefit of individuals it is not a nullity but is merely unenforceable such unconstitutionality can be waived and in that case the law becomes enforceable He said that in America this principle was well settled and he referred to Cooley on Constitutional Limitations Volume pages to <NAME> on Constitutional Law at He then referred to certain American decisions in support of his views and then said The position must be the same under our Constitution when a law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of individuals It is open to any person whose rights have been infringed to waive it and when there is waiver there is no legal impediment to the enforcement of the law Both these declarations of unconstitutionality go to the root of the power itself and there is no real distinction between them of the Constitution and said that it was a clear and unequivocal mandate of the fundamental law prohibiting the <ORG> from making any laws which came into conflict with Part III of the Constitution His Lordship added In our opinion the doctrine of waiver enunciated by some American Judges in construing the American Constitution cannot be introduced in our Constitution without a fuller discussion of the matter Without finally expressing an opinion on this question we are not for the moment convinced that this theory has any relevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution They have been put there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no application to provisions of law which have been enacted as a matter of constitutional policy of the Constitution was to prohibit the <ORG> from making any laws which came into conflict with Part III of the Constitution and he recognised no such distinction as was drawn by <NAME> between absence of legislative power that is incompetence of the legislature and non observance of provisions which operate merely as a check on the exercise of legislative power Secondly he referred to the preamble and the scheme of Part III of the Constitution in support of his view that the doctrine of waiver did not apply Article is in two parts the first part deals with all laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution and says that so far as such laws are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III they shall to the extent of such inconsistency be void the second part deals with laws made after the commencement of the Constitution and says that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution and any law made in contravention of cl of Art It seems clear to me that the Article itself recognises the distinction between absence of legislative power which will make the law made by an incompetent legislature wholly void and exercise of legislative power in contravention of a restriction or check on such power which will make the law void to the extent of the inconsistency or contravention This was an unanimous decision of this Court and several earlier decisions including the decision in <NAME> case on which <NAME> placed so much reliance were considered therein The decision in <NAME> was also considered and then the following observations were made with regard to Art Such law existed for all past transactions and for enforcement of rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution as was held in <NAME> case The law continued in force even after the commencement of the Constitution with respect to persons who were not citizens and could not claim the fundamental right had the effect of nullifying or rendering the existing law which had become inconsistent with Art The aforesaid view expressed in <NAME> case was accepted in many later decisions including the decision in <NAME> case if it is then the court is next to consider whether in the case of an Act passed by the <ORG> of a Province now a State its operation extends beyond the boundaries of the Province or the State for under the provisions conferring legislative powers on it such <ORG> can only make a law for its territories or any part thereof and its laws cannot in the absence of a territorial nexus have any extra territorial operation If the impugned law satisfies both these tests then finally the court has to ascertain if there is anything in any other part of the Constitution which places any fetter on the legislative powers of such <ORG> The impugned law has to pass all these three test does not necessarily militate against the application of the doctrine of waiver in respect of the provisions contained in Part III of our Constitution I do not find any In other words there is an attempt at adjustment of individual rights with social good and in that sense the limitations or restrictions are also defined Take for example an ordinary statutory enactment like of the Code of Civil Procedure which says that no suit shall be instituted against the Government or against a public officer in respect of any act purporting to be done by such public officer in his official capacity until the expiration of two months next after a notice in writing has been given etc There is undoubtedly a reason of public policy behind this provision but it is open to the party for whose benefit the vision has been made to waive notice and indeed the party may be estopped by his conduct from pleading the want of notice Villavar Chettiar <ORG> there is no inconsistency between the propositions that the provisions of a section are mandatory and must be enforced by the court and that they may be waived by the authority for whose benefit they are provided It is to be remembered that the rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution are not confined to citizens alone Article for example does not give any right to any person on the contrary it gives power to <ORG> to modify the rights conferred by Part III in their application to persons the Constitution and a right guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution With regard to an ordinary statutory right there is I think no difficulty With regard to a constitutional right it may be pointed out that there are several provisions in our Constitution which do not occur in Part III but which yet relate to certain rights take for example the rights relating to the Services under the <ORG> and the States in Part XIV I do not think that it can be seriously contended that a right which is granted to a Government servant for his benefit cannot be waived by him provided no question of jurisdiction is involved These provisions also impose certain restrictions on the legislative powers of the <ORG> and of the States with regard to trade and commerce But can we say the same thing in respect of all the rights Let us take Art which says that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law and that no property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of law which provides for compensation etc Can such a man after two or three years change his mind and say that the law is invalid and his land on which a school or a hospital may have been built in the meantime should be restored to him because he could not waive his fundamental right In my opinion if we express the view in the abstract that no fundamental right can ever be waived many startling and unforeseen results may follow Suppose a man obtains a permit or a licence for running a motor vehicle or an excise shop Having enjoyed the benefit of the permit for several years is it open to him to say when action is proposed to be taken against him to terminate the licence that the law under which the permit was granted to him was not constitutionally valid Having derived all the benefit from the permit granted to him is it open to him to say that the very Act under which a permit was granted to him is not valid in law Such and other startling results will follow if we decide in the abstract by a general negative that a fundamental right can never be waived which is a right to a constitutional remedy namely the right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III Suppose a person exercises that right and initiates appropriate proceedings for enforcement of a fundamental right Later he thinks better of it and withdraws his application Still later he changes his mind and the order passed on his application for withdrawal had no legal validity We may take still another example of the Constitution all minorities whether based on religion or language have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Suppose there is a minority educational institution and the minority has the right to administer that institution but they want grant from <ORG> Can the minority waive its right Such a question arose for consideration in the advisory opinion which we gave in connection with the Kerala Education Bill and so far as I have been able to understand the effect of our opinion is that the minority can surrender part of its right of administration of a school of its own choice in order to get aid from <ORG> The learned author has summarised the position thus There are certain constitutional provisions that may be waived by the person for whose protection they were intended A person who would otherwise be entitled to raise a constitutional issue is sometimes denied that right because he is estopped to do so The factor usually present in these cases is conduct inconsistent with file present assertion of that right or conduct of such character that it would be unjust to others to permit him to avoid liability on constitutional grounds The acceptance of a benefit under one provision of an Act does not ordinarily preclude a person from asserting the invalidity of another and severable provision thereof but there are exceptions to this rule Sometimes rights have been divided into natural rights and civil rights and natural rights have been stated to be those which are necessarily inherent or innate and which come from the very elementary laws of nature whereas civil rights are those which arise from the needs of civil as distinguished from barbaric communities There are in my opinion clear indications in Part III of the Constitution itself that the doctrine of natural rights had played no part in the formulation of the provisions therein and which give <ORG> power to modify the rights conferred by Part III Therefore I am of the view that the doctrine of natural rights affords nothing but a foundation of shifting sand for building up a thesis that the doctrine of waiver does not apply to the rights guaranteed in Part III of our Constitution In the case before us I have held that there is no foundation on facts to sustain the plea of waiver Therefore I would allow the appeal with costs <NAME> I have had the advantage of perusing the judgments of my Lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother <NAME> I agree with their conclusion but I would prefer to express my opinion separately in regard to the question of the applicability of the doctrine of waiver to the fundamental rights In the circumstances I cannot share the opinion of my learned brother <NAME> that this Court should avoid a decision on this question and leave it to be decided in a more appropriate case The facts have been fully stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in his judgment and I need not restate them The learned Attorney General contended that in the American Law the principle of waiver was applied to rights created by the Constitution except in cases where the protection of the rights was based upon public policy and that by the same analogy if no public policy was involved even in India the person affected by the infringement of the fundamental rights could waive the constitutional protection guaranteed to him It was said that in the present case the appellant waived his fundamental right under Art They give protection against self incrimination The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United <ORG>s prescribes that no person shall be deprived of life To this rule there are no exceptions note that the doctrine of waiver extends to rights and privileges of any character and since the word waiver covers every conceivable right it is the general rule that a person may waive any matter which affects his property and any alienable right or privilege of which he is the owner or which belongs to him or to which he is legally entitled whether secured by contract conferred by statute or guaranteed by constitution provided such rights and privileges rest in the individual are intended for his sole benefit do not infringe on the rights of others and further provided the waiver Of the right or privilege is not forbidden by law and does not contravene public policy and the principle is recognized that everyone has a right to waive and agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity if it can be dispensed with and relinquished without infringing on any public right and without detriment to the community at large As a general rule rights relating to procedure and remedy are subject to waiver but if a right is so fundamental in its nature as to be regarded by the state as vitally integrated in immemorially established processes of the administration of justice it cannot be waived by anyone The cases cited at the <ORG> illustrate the aforesaid principles But if the privilege conferred or the right created by the statute is solely for the benefit of the individual he can waive it This leads me to the question whether the fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution pertain to that category of rights which could be waived To put it differently whether the Constitutional guarantee in regard to the fundamental rights restricts or ousts the jurisdiction of the relevant authorities under the Constitution to make laws in derogation of the said rights or whether the said rights are for the benefit of the general public While it is true that the judgments of <ORG> of the United States are of a great assistance to this Court in elucidating and solving the difficult problems that arise from time to time it is equally necessary to keep in mind the fact that the decisions are given in the context of a different social economic and political set up and therefore great care should be bestowed in applying those decisions to cases arising in India with different social economic and political conditions The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void This Article in clear and unambiguous terms not only declares that all laws in fore before the commencement of the Constitution and made thereafter taking away or abridging the said rights would be void to the extent of the contravention but also prohibits the <ORG> from making any law taking away or abridging the said rights For the same purpose the said chapter imposes a limitation on the power of the <ORG> to make laws in violation of those rights While in America this process of reconciliation was allowed to be evolved by the course of judicial decisions in India the fundamental rights and their limitations are crystallized and embodied in the Constitution itself while in America a freehand was given to the judiciary not only to evolve the content of the right but also its limitations in the Indian Constitution there is not much scope for such a process Article embodies the famous principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws and Arts The principle underlying these Articles is the mainspring of our democratic form of government and it guarantees to its citizens equal protection in respect of both substantive and procedural laws When one realizes the unequal positions occupied by the <ORG> and the private citizen particularly in India where illiteracy is rampant it is easy to visualize that in a conflict between the <ORG> and a citizen the latter may by fear of force or hope of preferment give up his right It is said that in such a case coercion or influence can be established in a Court of law but in practice it will be well nigh impossible to do so Article reads All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business are concerned I cannot visualise any contingency where a citizen would be in a worse position than he was if he could not exercise the right of waiver In regard to freedom to acquire hold and dispose of property a plausible argument may be advanced namely that a citizen should have a right to waive his right to acquire hold and dispose of property for otherwise he might be compelled to acquire and hold his property even if he intended to give it up There is an underlying fallacy in this argument So too a person may not acquire the property at all or practise any profession but if he seeks to acquire property or practise any profession he cannot be told that he has waived his right at an earlier stage to acquire property or practise the profession There is an essential distinction between the non exercise of a right and the exercise of a right subject to the doctrine of waiver of cl there cannot be any occasion when a citizen would be worse off than when he had no fundamental rights under the Article no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law and Art which prohibits employment of children in factories cannot be waived It declares that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion The cultural and educational rights of the minorities and their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice are given for the protection of the rights of the minorities and it cannot be said that they are not in public interest Secondly if the owner of a property intends to give it to the <ORG> the <ORG> can always insist upon conveying to it the said property in the manner known to law By express provisions of the Constitution the <ORG> is prohibited from making any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution When an application is dismissed for whatever reason it may be whether on merits or on admission the order of the <ORG> becomes final and it can be reopened only in the manner prescribed by law There is no scope for the application of the doctrine of waiver in such a cage Article confers power on <ORG> to modify the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution in their application to facts and the latter enables it to impose restrictions on the rights conferred by that Part while martial law is in force in any area Article confers on the <ORG> the power to legislate for giving effect to the provisions of Part III to the exclusion of the Legislatures of the States Having enjoyed the benefit for several years and when action is proposed to be taken against him to terminate the licence he contends that the law under which the permit was granted to him offended his fundamental rights and therefore constitutionally not valid It is asked whether it would be open to him to say that the very Act under which the permit was granted to him was not valid in law I have considered the various provisions relating to the fundamental rights with a view to discover if there is any justification for the comment that without the aid of the doctrine of waiver a citizen in certain circumstances would be in a worse position than that he would be if he exercised his right I have shown that there is none I have therefore no hesitation in holding that the fundamental rights created by the Constitution are transcendental in nature conceived and enacted in national and public interest and therefore cannot be waived It is suggested that there is a distinction between a case where the enactment is beyond the legislative competence Of the <ORG> which made it and the case where the law is unconstitutional on the ground of existence of a constitutional limitation that while in the former case the law is null and void in the latter case the law is unenforceable and may be revived by the removal of the limitation by an amendment of the Constitution He observed at page thus It is axiomatic that when the law making power of a <ORG> is restricted by written fundamental law then any law enacted and opposed to the fundamental law is in excess of the legislative authority and is thus a nullity Both these declarations of unconstitutionality go to the root of the power itself and there is no real distinction between them This Court answered the question in the affirmative III which conferred the fundamental rights on the citizens It did not become void independently of the existence of the rights guaranteed by Part III In Short Article had the effect of nullifying or rendering the existing law which had become inconsistent with Art This judgment does not say anything different from that expressed in <NAME> case nor does it dissent from the view expressed by <NAME> in <NAME> case The legal position vis a vis the law declared to be void either on the ground of legislative incompetence or for the reason of constitu tional limitation as stated in the earlier decisions remains unshaken by this decision If the Commissioner had no jurisdiction the appellant could not by waiving his right confer jurisdiction on him Even so it was contended that the accused had waived his fundamental right and therefore he could not sustain his defence Without finally expressing an opinion on this question we are not for the moment convinced that this theory has any relevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of our Constitution They have been put there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no application to provisions of law which have been enacted as a matter of Constitutional policy But the learned Judge made it clear in his judgment that the question of waiver had no bearing to any issue of fact arising for determination in that case but only for showing the nature of the right declared under Art <NAME> <NAME> as he then was in his dissenting judgment did not state his view on this question but expressly reserved it in the following words In coming to the conclusion that I have I have in a large measure found myself in agreement with the views of <NAME> on that part of the case I respectfully agree with the observations of <NAME> <NAME> For the aforesaid reasons hold that the doctrine of waiver has no application in the case of fundamental rights under our Constitution The appellant shall get costs of this appeal
