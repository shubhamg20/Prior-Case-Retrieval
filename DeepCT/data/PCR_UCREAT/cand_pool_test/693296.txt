This appeal has been preferred against the decision of <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> against its decision awarding a sum of Rs There is no effective cross examination and nothing is suggested to him that the accident happened in any other manner that the boy was run over on account of the boy negligence and no theory is suggested to this witness to make out that the driver of the bus was not negligent and that the accident occurred on account of the negligence of the boy suddenly running across the bus or at the rear side of the bus The Judge has adverted to the discrepancy between the evidence of and as well as the discrepancy revealed in the evidence of who gave evidence in the criminal case in which the bus driver was prosecuted Admittedly there was no passenger in the bus and it is clear that the driver has driving the bus in a rash and negligent manner in a fast speed and without any care and caution which resulted in the death of the boy We have perused the evidence of the bus driver and the conductor and we have no> hesitation to say that their evidence is unreliable We have not the slightest hesitation in accepting the finding of the <ORG> that the death was due to the rash and negligent driving of the bus by the driver without taking any care or caution in the matter Section does not lay down any condition as to the manner of the exercise of jurisdiction by the tribunal and all that it states is that it has to hold an enquiry into the claim and make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just Section bars the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> to entertain any question relating to any claim for compensation arising out of motor vehicles accidents for which special provision has been made in the Act Our attention was drawn to certain decisions arising out of the claims under the Motor Vehicles Act as amended in revealing a divergence of view on the question whether the newly introduced provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act are self contained and constitute an exhaustive machinery or whether the ultimate liability should be determined only in accordance with the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act and the principles enunciated by decisions rendered under that Act The reasoning of the Bench is that the provisions in Sections to do not enter into the field of the law of liability which would still continue to be governed by the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act and the law of torts and the new provisions are in no way intended to give a go by to the limits and the basis of the liability which will have to be determined under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act and that Sections A to provide merely a cheap and expeditious remedy for the ascertainment of that liability The Bench observed that the expression just in Section is wide in ambit than the words used in Sections A and of the Fatal Accidents Act and that the tribunal has to only consider what appears to it to be just compensation and it need not strictly follow and apply the basis of the assessment of compensation indicated in the various decisions under the Fatal Accidents Act Indian or English though they may be merely of general guidance The question which the Bench had to decide was whether the expression representative in the Fatal Accidents Act means the same thing as the same word used in Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act and the Bench held that the expression legal representatives in the Motor Vehicles Act is used in the general sense and not in the restricted sense as in the Fatal Accidents Act With respect we agree with the view taken in the decision of <ORG> It has various meanings and its meaning is often governed by the context At page of words and Phrases edited by <ORG> Volume the true meaning of the word just is in these terms The word just is derived from the Latin Justus which is from the Latin jus which means a right and more technically a legal right at law Again at page of the same book it is stated Instruction that plaintiff in action for personal injury had burden of proving by preponderance of the evidence that his claim is just and that he is entitled to recover was erroneous as a just claim is not always a legal claim that may be compensated for in damages and as just may apply in nearly all its senses to either ethics or law denoting something which is normally right and fair and sometimes that which is right and fair according to positive law There is no need to refer to other Dictionaries or cases in which the word just in conjunction with other words like just and reasonable just and fair and just and expedient has been explained by the <ORG> because the word just will take its colour from the main purpose and object of the enactment It is enough to hold that the word just in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act has been used in a very wide and comprehensive sense We are therefore of the view that there is no warrant for literally importing the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act into Section of the Motor Vehicles Act so as to read both the provisions as part and parcel of the provision The decisions rendered under the general law of torts and under the Fatal Accidents Act will undoubtedly be relevant and constitute broad guidelines but they would not be binding upon the <ORG> in the sense that the method of approach should be the same and identical as in the cases arising under the Fatal Accidents Act In the instant case on the question of compensation there is the evidence of the father of the victim which has been accepted by the <ORG> There is no contra rebutting evidence There is nothing in the family environment to detract in any manner from the full prospects of a predominantly happy life It is obvious there is no exact uniform rule for measuring the value of the human life and the measure of damages cannot be arrived at in precise mathematical calculation but the amount recoverable depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case We may now take it as settled law that under the Fatal Accidents Act the liability under Section and Section are distinct different and independent The two claims are based upon different causes of action and the claimants would be entitled to recover compensation separately under both the heads If however the person who takes benefit under Section happens to be the same person as is entitled to compensation under Section there cannot be duplication of the same claim and the compensation awarded under Section for the loss to the estate of the deceased will be taken into account in the calculation of the compensation payable to the claimants under Section Reference may be made to the following classical statement of the law by Lord <NAME> at page in <ORG> <NAME> A These are no doubt pregnant pieces of evidence but they are only pieces of evidence and the necessary inference can I think be drawn from circumstances other than and different from them In the matter of ascertainment of damages the appellate <ORG> should be slow in disturbing the findings reached by the <ORG>s below if they have taken all the relevant facts into consideration But there was a reasonable probability of his becoming a successful man in life as he was a bright boy in the school and his parents could have afforded him a good education It is not likely that he would have given any financial assistance to his parents till he was at least years old There is no material on record to find out as to how old were the parents of the deceased at the time of his death It is unnecessary to refer to the several cases cited by Counsel on both sides as the determination of compensation turns upon the particular facts of each case The pecuniary loss sustained by the persons entitled to claim compensation as a result of the accident In determining the pecuniary loss say the age of the boy at the time of his death the age of the parents and the prospects of the boy contributing his earnings to the parents will have to be taken note of In some of the decisions it is seen that the Courts have taken rather a pessimistic view of the future prospects of the young boy who met with the accident on tire ground that no one can be certain about the child future or correctly estimate his future pecuniary prospects in the view that the boy would have to pass through several risks and uncertainities in his childhood and young age and on that account a moderate sum has been awarded as damages In some other cases Courts have taken a more liberal view and have awarded damages under both the headings on the basis of predominantly happy life which the victim would have lived but for the accident taken along with the fact that the boy was a bright boy and that the parents evinced great interest in shaping the career of the boy and in his prospects The severest punishment that the law knows is that of depriving a man of his life it is considered of greater value than liberty and to be a more severe punishment than depriving a man of his liberty for the rest of his natural life which usually means at the outside I suppose something under twenty years The fact that the father of the infant was an executive earning per year was also taken into account <NAME> who tried the action and awarded as damages observed as follows at page The infant plaintiff is I think entitled to something for what he has lost whether he knows he has lost it or not albeit that the amount may well be less than in the case of a person who has enjoyed life and amenities and knows that he has lost them There are so many imponderabless especially in the case of such a young child In addition there are questions of taxation and other matters but whatever view one takes as to eventual earnings the figure must in the case of such a young child he heavily discounted Doing the best I can in all the circumstances I would award to this child a sum of In the appeal from that decision reported in <NAME> <NAME> All Holroyd Pearce while adverting to the difficult task in assessing the value the loss of expectation of a predominantly happy life observed that the assessment of such a claim involves an investigation in detail of the temperament and health of the victim his expectation of life and his expectation of material prosperity We can only alter it if we are satisfied that it is a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage if we are satisfied that broadly speaking there is only one reasonable answer to the problem and that the learned Judge has failed to give it I can give no adequate reason to support a higher figure or to show that one figure is more right than the other Taking an overall picture of all the aspects of the case and also bearing in mind that under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to award just compensation is Very wide and comprehensive we cannot say that this situation envisaged by <NAME> has arisen in this case Amongst other considerations the <ORG> has awarded damages on the basis that the victim is likely to contribute a sum of Rs
