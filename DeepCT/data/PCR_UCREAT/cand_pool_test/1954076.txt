This Second Appeal by the plaintiff raises the question of jurisdiction of the civil Court to decide whether the land of which possession is sought to be recovered in the suit is ryoti in character He set up an agreement dated th July under which he sold to the defendant for a certain sum the plantain crops he had raised and averred that the defendant contrary to the terms of the agreement defaulted to surrender possession of the land after removing the standing crops and continued to be in unlawful possession setting up title in himself He also contended that in view of the Madras Amending Act XXIX of the civil Court had no jurisdiction to try the issue as to whether the land was ryoti in character In order to decide the question of jurisdiction it is necessary first of all to notice the salient provisions of the Madras Estates Land Reduction of Rent Act The same section lays down the procedure for comparison of the two average rates and fixation of the extent to which the rates of rent payable for each class of ryoti land in the village taken up for comparison should be reduced and the rates of rent payable for each such class of land after such reduction The other provisions of Section direct that after the order of the <ORG> has taken effect the rents from the village in the estate shall be collected by the <ORG> in the manner and subject to the conditions provided therein Section provides for power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act Rule framed under that section enables the Collector to fix the rent payable for each holding with reference to the notified rate applicable to a particular class of land in the village It is also provided by the same section that suits instituted under the Proviso to Section of the Madras Estates Land Act pending on the date on which the provisions of the Amending Act except Sections and came into force should also stand transferred to the <ORG> constituted under the Act and be dealt with by it as if they were appeals preferred under the Act Then comes Section which lays down a rule of presumption namely that any land in respect of which an application has not been filed within the time prescribed under Clause of Sub section of Section A or in respect of which an application is not admitted under the Proviso to that clause shall be deemed to be ryoti land But the question whether it is ryoti arises incidentally to the determination whether the plaintiff is entitled to recovery of possession Whether there is anything in the provisions of Madras Act XXIX of which in any way affects that jurisdiction because in granting a prayer for possession the civil <ORG> has incidentally and necessarily to go into the quest ion as to the character of the land has to be decided Sri <NAME> the learned Counsel for the appellant contends that the jurisdiction vested in the Collector by Section A introduced by the Amending Act XXIX of to decide whether any land in a village is or is not a ryoti land is a special jurisdiction created for the purpose of the main Act namely the reduction and fixation of rents for individual holdings in a village in an estate and that it is not intended by the Amending Act to totally exclude the jurisdiction of <ORG> to determine the question as to the character of the land when it has got to be dealt with and decided incidentally for the purpose of granting a prayer within its purview It is no doubt true that if any question arises whether a land in a village is or is not ryoti land the Collector is vested with the jurisdiction to decide it If a question arises in connection with the fixation of rent for a particular holding in an estate whether the holding constitutes ryoti land that of course will be exclusively within the purview of the Collector and <ORG> will have no jurisdiction to entertain and decide a suit solely for a declaration that the land is ryoti It seems to me that where only <ORG> has jurisdiction to grant the main prayer like the recovery of possession and in order to decide whether that prayer can be granted it is necessary to decide incidentally the character of the land <ORG> will not cease to have jurisdiction to decide that question because the Collector under Madras Act XXIX of has been entrusted with the jurisdiction for the purpose of Madras Act XXX of There is nothing in the Amending Act to exclude the jurisdiction of <ORG> to decide matters incidental to the grant of the relief which is wholly and exclusively within its jurisdiction For instance Section of Madras Act XXX of has expressly barred the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any non ryotwari area is or is not an estate or part of an estate as defined by the Madras Estates Land Act or whether it is or is not an inam estate as defined by the Abolition Act or in respect of any matter which the <ORG> or the Special Appellate <ORG> constituted under that Act is empowered to determine Section of that Act requires that all suits appeals or other proceedings pending at the commencement of the Act before any <ORG> or <ORG> or Settlement Officer in which any question was in issue whether a particular area is or was an estate as defined in Section The learned Judges in that case after referring to Sections and in Act XXX of observed It will be noted that express words are used to oust the jurisdiction of every Court other than the Tribunals constituted under Section or <ORG> constituted under Section when these two questions arise for determination Where the civil <ORG> has jurisdiction to grant a particular prayer which is not within the power of any other forum the <ORG> will have a right to decide all questions incidental to the grant of such a prayer although a different forum has been constituted to decide such questions for certain purposes contemplated by the relevant statute In <NAME> <NAME> in which the plea was that Section of the Abolition Act was a bar to the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> to determine matters mentioned therein it was held by <NAME> that a civil <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain a suit in regard to a matter within its purview cannot be taken away merely because in deciding such matters the <ORG> has to incidentally decide a matter which is within the jurisdiction of the <ORG> constituted under special Acts My Lord the Chief Justice delivering the judgment on behalf of the Bench in that case observed The object of Section being to enable an adjudication of a dispute for the purpose of the Act exclusion of <ORG> jurisdiction cannot by implication be held to be more than what is necessary for working out the rights created by the statute <NAME> the learned Counsel for the respondent however contends that there is nothing in Madras Act XXIX of to suggest that the jurisdiction vested in the Collector to determine whether a land is ryoti or not is only for the purpose of Madras Act XXX of and ii that the scheme of the Amending Act showed that the jurisdiction of the Collector is exclusive and that the civil Court will have no jurisdiction even incidentally to decide that question In that Act there was no provision enabling the Collector to decide the character of the land while applying notifications to particular holdings The fact that such a jurisdiction has been vested in the Collector does not mean that the civil Court which is the forum to decide the grant or otherwise of a prayer for recovery of possession has been deprived of the jurisdiction to decide incidentally at least a similar question No doubt the Amending Act prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Collector in disposing of applications to determine the character of the land prescribes also the limitation for such applications transfer of certain suits and applications under Madras Act I of appeals against the orders of the Collector and the finality of the orders passed by the <ORG> on appeal But all this in my opinion does not detract from the jurisdiction of the civil Court to go into and decide incidental matters such as whether the land is ryoti in order to grant or refuse the prayer for recovery of possession of the land In my opinion therefore the <ORG> below were not right in their view that they had no jurisdiction to decide the incidental question whether the suit land is pannai or ryoti in character
