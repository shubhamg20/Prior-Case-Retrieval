DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH RAMASWAMY BENCH RAMASWAMY FAIZAN UDDIN KIRPAL CITATION SCC JT SCALE ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT Ramaswamy Leave granted in all the special leave petitions When these appeals had come up for hearing on October it was pointed out to another Bench by the Additional Solicitor General that despite the dismissal the matter required examination and for that reason notice was already issued in another case viz It is due to administrative exigencies of the concerned <ORG> or the <ORG> that appointment or dismissal can be made by the President committee as per the procedure prescribed under the respective Acts or the Rules or bye laws made thereunder In this case since admittedly the A Co operative <ORG> Act of for short the Act is applicable its provisions and of the predecessor Acts repealed thereunder and of the Rules made thereunder as amended from time to time and bye laws of the society are required to be examined Section prescribes the procedure for constitution of a committee and their duties and responsibilities etc Section prescribes procedure for holding general body meeting of the <ORG> and the committee and sub section thereof empowers the Registrar to appoint a Special Officer with remuneration for the management of the committee Section with an non obstante clause and subject to the execution of an agreement empowers the <ORG> to deduct the share capital or any amount from monthly salary or wages payable to a member of the <ORG> Sub section of Section with a non obstante clause provides that any dispute touching upon the constitution management or the business of the <ORG> other than a dispute regarding disciplinary action taken by the <ORG> or its committee against a paid employee of the <ORG> shall be resolved by arbitration on a reference under Section and recovery of the monies due to it Chapter XII deals with offences and penalties Section A with a non obstante clause gives power in Chapter IVX to the Registrar to constitute a common cadre for the categories of employees for certain societies enumerated thereunder Section bars the jurisdiction of courts and provides that no order decision or action taken or direction issued under the Act by an arbitrator liquidator Registrar or <ORG> etc shall be liable to be called in question in any court Notwithstanding anything contained in the bye laws special bye laws service regulations or common cadre regulations of the co operative societies every paid servant and officer of a society other than those in the last grade service shall retire from service on the afternoon of the last date of the month in which he attains the age of years Power to appoint officers employees and servants of the society is given to the President or the committee as the case may Under bye laws subject to the resolutions passed by the managing committee from time to time several officers of the society shall have the powers to manage the society as enumerated thereunder Except in the case of fine an appeal shall lie to the <ORG> against every order awarding a punishment by the President It enjoys exclusive power to appoint and keep disciplinary control over the staff in its establishment It would thereby be clear that appointments of the staff of the establishment control and disciplinary actions are regulated under the provisions of the Act the Rules and the remedies provided under law Paragraph of the Indian Railway Establishment Code defines Railway Servant to mean a person who is a member of a service or who holds a post under the administrative control of <ORG> and includes a post in <ORG> In other words a person must be appointed to a service or a holder of a post under the administrative control of <ORG> including a post in <ORG> itself In the light of those factual matrices it was held that there was no relationship of employer and employee between the <ORG> Administration and the employees engaged in the institutes and clubs <NAME> in all frankness admitted that there is a dichotomy of dual control exercised by the Registrar under the Act and the control by <ORG> It also gives free accommodation for housing the <ORG> electricity free medical aid in its hospitals to those employed by the <ORG> There is no obligation on the part of <ORG> to provide security for those employees In other words there is a dual control over the staff by the <ORG> and the Registrar With due and great respect to our learned brethren constituting the <ORG> these features noted by us do not appear to have been put up for their consideration and so they did not have occasion to consider the impact as envisaged hereinbefore Based on the provisions of the Railway Manual and taking into consideration the actual working of the Stores the <ORG> has come to the conclusion that the employees working in the Co operative Stores are in fact and in law the employees of <ORG> We therefore have no hesitation to hold that the officers employees and servants appointed by <ORG> cannot be treated on par with <ORG> servants under paragraph of the <ORG> Establishment Code nor they can be given parity of status promotions scales of pay increments etc
