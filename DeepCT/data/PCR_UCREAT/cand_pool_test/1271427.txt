CASE NO Appeal civil of PETITIONER <ORG> Others RESPONDENT <NAME> Others DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH ASHOK BHAN SINHA JUDGMENT BHAN This appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of wherein and whereunder <ORG> while setting aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition No of issued a direction to <ORG> for short the <ORG> the appellant herein to issue possession certificate to the writ petitioner i the st respondent herein in respect of acres and guntas of land as per its Resolution dated and to allot alternative plots sites of equal size to the persons who had been allotted sites carved out of acres and guntas of land The City of Bangalore Improvement Act was enacted by the then <ORG> The Board was also given the power to acquire land by agreement and was deemed to be a local authority for the purposes of Section of the Mysore Land Acquisition Act which was in pari materia with the Land Acquisition Act of On a preliminary notification dated was published in the official <ORG> proposing to acquire the land of the st respondent for formation of a scheme to set up a layout called the Koramangala Layout It is suffice to mention that in so far as the refund of compensation amount was concerned it was found to be neither feasible nor practicable for the st respondent to withdraw the amount and re deposit it and he therefore gave it in writing to the authority that these amounts would not be withdrawn by him or claimed by him whereupon the amounts in question were ultimately re claimed by the authority A learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition summarily at the admission stage as being concluded by the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Vs State of Karnataka ILR Karnataka of and this Court by its order dated accepted the appeal and set aside the orders impugned in the appeal and remitted the case back to the Division Bench to reconsider the appeal on merits in view of the contentions raised on behalf of the st respondent that in a later judgment in <NAME> Vs <ORG> ILR Karnataka <ORG> had taken a view that re conveyance was permissible <ORG> after remand considered the matter afresh and set aside the judgment of the Single Judge inter alia holding that there was change in the judicial thinking and in <NAME> case supra <ORG> taking a wider perspective of the entire case law had held that it was permissible to restore or re allot the land to the owners Drawing support from Section of the General Clauses Act it was held that the authority vested with the power to do a thing had a corresponding right to undo it as well In view of the above findings <ORG> held that there was no necessity to give a direction to re convey the land but the proper direction would be to direct the <ORG> to issue the possession certificate to st respondent in respect of the land which is the subject matter of the writ petition Learned counsels for the parties have been heard at length Another Division Bench in Writ Appeal No of <NAME> Others Vs State Others held that the lands acquired become the property of <ORG> and it has to be dealt with in accordance with the law and owners of the land in the absence of a statutory provision entitling them to get the land re conveyed would not be entitled to seek relief from the <ORG> under Article of the Constitution of India It was observed as under Assuming for the sake of argument that the other lands which have been acquired by <ORG> have been re conveyed that by itself is not sufficient to hold that the appellants have a legal right in their favour for getting the lands acquired from them re conveyed to them In the absence of a statutory provision entitling the appellants to get re conveyance they would not be entitled to seek any relief from this Court under Article of the Constitution on the ground that <ORG> has in similar cases re conveyed lands in favour of persons from whom they were acquired A single Judge in Writ Petition No of <NAME> Vs State Others again held that <ORG> had no power to pass a resolution of re conveyance In <NAME> Vs State of Karnataka a learned Single Judge which decision was later on affirmed by the Division Bench held that there was no provision in the Act and the Rules framed thereunder enabling the <ORG> to re convey the sites The rules did not provide for re conveyance and therefore it was not possible to hold that there is any right to seek re conveyance It was also held that it was not possible to apply the rule of promissory estoppel on the facts of the case as there was no provision in the Act or in the Rules framed thereunder enabling the <ORG> to allot or re convey the sites in the manner proposed to be done by the Notification It was observed in para Learned Counsel for the petitioner has not been able to place reliance on any of the provisions in the Act or on the Rules framed thereunder which enable the <ORG> to re convey the site Therefore it is not possible to hold that the petitioners have a right to seek re conveyance The petitioners claim that as per and in pursuance of the notification Annexure they have filed the affidavits and have not challenged the acquisition and have altered their position to their disadvantage therefore it is not now open to the <ORG> to resile from the notification and deny allotment of sites to the petitioners by way of re conveyance The said plea was rejected by observing thus In addition to this it is not possible to apply the rule of promissory estoppel in cases where there is no provision contained in the Act or in the Rules framed thereunder enabling the <ORG> to allot or re convey the sites in the manner proposed to be done by the notification Vs <ORG> and Another Justice <NAME> expressed his agreement with the view taken by <NAME> to the following effect If the <ORG> were to be given the power to re convey the land vested in it by exercising the power under Section of the Act that would be self defeating the destructive of the purpose of constituting a special authority for the development of the City of Bangalore In <NAME> case supra on which reliance has been placed in the impugned judgment to come to the conclusion that there was shift in the judicial thinking regarding the power of the <ORG> to re convey the land acquired to the owner the facts were A Writ Petition No of was filed by the owners of the land seeking issuance of a Writ of Mandamus directing the <ORG> to deliver possession certificate in respect of acre of land in Survey No of Jadahalli It was held that no material had been placed on record to hold that the land in question had in fact been acquired for a scheme or that the allotment of site contravened the scheme Further the <ORG> had the power to allot site under Rule without following the procedure prescribed in Rule provided the other requirements of Rule are fulfilled No serious contention could be urged on behalf of the respondent to rebut the contention urged on behalf of the appellant that the word reconveyance had been used in the Resolution dated and all the subsequent correspondence in a loose sense and in fact the said word meant allotment grant of site within the meaning of Rule When that is so and when in fact the Resolution coupled with the correspondence between the petitioner and the <ORG> shows that what was done was an allotment as contemplated under Rule the contention the word re conveyance appears to have been used in a loose sense because the allottee was the previous owner of the said land prior to the acquisition but in truth it is a case of allotment has to be accepted Further he had also complied with all other requirements imposed by the <ORG> On close scrutiny it has to be held that in <NAME> case supra the Bench did not express an opinion contrary to the opinion which had been expressed in the earlier decisions to the effect that there was no power under the Act or the Rules with the <ORG> to re convey the acquired land on the contrary the Bench expressed its agreement with the view taken in <NAME> case supra and other cases to the effect that the <ORG> was not vested with the power under the Act or Rules to re convey the land which had been acquired for a scheme On the facts of the case the Bench came to the conclusion that it was a case of allotment as contemplated under Rule and not that of re conveyance <ORG> in the impugned judgment has misread and misapplied <NAME> case supra judgment to come to the conclusion that there was a shift in the judicial thinking and that the land acquired could be re conveyed to the owners State of Karnataka amended the Bangalore Development Authority Act by the Bangalore Development Authorities rd Amendment Act for short the Amendment Act which came into force with effect from st March Power of <ORG> to make allotment in certain cases Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law or any development scheme sanctioned under this Act or <ORG> Act where the <ORG> or the erstwhile <ORG> Bangalore has already passed a resolution in favour of any persons any site formed in the land which belong to them or vested in or acquired by them for the purpose of any development scheme and on the ground that it is not practicable to include such site for the purpose of the development scheme the <ORG> may allot such site by way of sale or lease in favour of such persons subject to the following conditions a the allottee shall be liable to pay any charges as the <ORG> may levy from time to time and the total extent of the site allotted under this section together with the land already held by the allottee shall not exceed the ceiling limit specified under Section of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act Notwithstanding anything contained in any law or any judgment decree or order of any court where in pursuance of any resolution passed by the <ORG> or the erstwhile <ORG> Bangalore to re convey in favour of any person any site out of the land which belonged to them or vested in or acquired by them for the purpose of any development scheme the <ORG> has made allotment of such site by way of sale lease or otherwise in favour of such person after the twentieth day of December and before eight day of May such allotment shall be deemed to have been validly made and shall have effect for all purpose as if it had been made under Section of the Principle Act as amended by this Act and accordingly a all acts proceedings and things done or allotment made or action taken by the authority shall for all purpose be deemed to be and to have always been done or taken in accordance with law no suit or other proceedings shall be instituted maintained or continued in any court for cancellation of such allotment or for questioning the validity of any action or things taken or done under Section of the Principle Act as amended by this Act and no court shall enforce or recognize any decree or order declaring such allotment made or any action taken or things done under the Principle Act as invalid It provides that irrespective of anything contained in any law or any judgment decree or order of any Court where in pursuance of any resolution passed by the authority or the erstwhile <ORG> Bangalore in favour of any person re conveying the site formed in the land which belong to them or vested in or acquired by them for the purpose of any development scheme and on the ground that it is not practicable to include such site for the purpose of any development scheme the <ORG> allot such site for the purpose of development scheme by way of sale or lease in favour of such persons subject to the allottee paying such charges which the authority may levy from time to time and the extent of site allotted under this provision together with the land already held by the allottee shall not exceed ceiling limit specified under Section of the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act It also starts with the non obstante clause and provides that if a resolution has been passed by <ORG> or <ORG> to re convey in favour of any person any site out of the land which belonged to him or vested or acquired from him for the purpose of any development scheme the <ORG> has already made allotment of such site by way of sale lease or otherwise in favour of such person after th of December and before th of May then such allotment shall be deemed to have been validly made and shall have effect for all purpose as if it is made under Section of the Principal Act as amended by Act of It gives the authority to the <ORG> to re convey allot in favour of any person any site formed in the land which belonged to them or vested in or acquired by them for the purpose of any development scheme and on the ground that it is not practicable to include such site for the purpose of development scheme by way of sale or lease in favour of such person whose land was acquired subject to his liability to pay any charges that the authority may levy from time to time and that the total extent of site allotted under this Section together with the land already held by the allottee would not exceed the ceiling limit under Section of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act It does not give any power to the <ORG> to re convey the land or a part of the land by withdrawing the acquisition itself Observations made by the Division Bench in the impugned judgment that Section enabled the <ORG> to re convey the land which had been acquired for a development scheme for a purpose other than implementing the scheme are not sustainable We may here notice the judgment of this Court in <NAME> Vs <ORG> SCC on which reliance has been placed by the counsel for the respondent to contend that Section would be applicable to the present case Taking note of Section read with Section of the Amendment Act it was held that the provisions of Section were fully applicable to the allotments made to the appellants during the period It was further observed in para as under Even otherwise we are of the view that the resolution of <ORG> did substantial justice to the appellants That the appellant could not be permitted to resile from the representation or promise made by it to the respondent as the respondent had acted on the representation and altered his position to its prejudice Plea taken by the appellant that rule of promissory estoppel shall not apply to do or perform an act prohibited by law or not authorised by law was rejected by observing that Act to re convey the land was not prohibited as there was a shift in the judicial thinking in <NAME> case supra That the appellant was debarred from resiling from the promise representation made especially in view of the fact that the respondent acting on the promise made to him had altered his position to his prejudice It is a doctrine evolved by equity in order to prevent injustice Where a party by his word or conduct makes a promise to another person in unequivocal and clear terms intending to create legal relations knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the party to whom the promise is made and it is so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it <ORG> Vs State of Uttar Pradesh SCC after analyzing the doctrine of promissory estoppel as applied in the <ORG>s of England and the United States held that in India the law may be taken to be settled that principle of promissory estoppel would be applicable to the <ORG> as well where it makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the promisee and the promisee in fact acting on the promise alters his position then the <ORG> will be held bound by the promise and such a promise would be enforceable against the <ORG> at the instance of the promisee The <ORG> committed as it is to the rule of law cannot claim immunity from the applicability of Rule of Promissory Estoppel and repudiate a promise made to it on the ground that such a promise may fetter its future executive action It was pointed out that since the doctrine of promissory estoppel is equitable doctrine it must yield when the equity so requires and if it can be shown by <ORG> that having regard to the facts as they have transpired it would be inequitable to hold the <ORG> to the promise made by it the <ORG> will not raise an equity in favour of the promisee and enforce the promise against the <ORG> Another exception carved out was that doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to compel the <ORG> or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law It was observed in para as under It may also be noted that promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to compel the <ORG> or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law The <ORG> can never be precluded from exercising its legislative function by resort to the doctrine of promissory estoppel Emphasis supplied Similarly in <ORG> represented by <NAME> Vs <ORG> of A SCC it was held that the <ORG> as a public authority cannot be compelled to carry out a representation or promise which is prohibited by law or which was devoid of authority or power of the officer of the <ORG> or the public authority to make the promise It was observed in para as under It is equally settled law that the promissory estoppel cannot be used to compel the <ORG> or a public authority to carry out a representation or promise which is prohibited by law or which was devoid of the authority or power of the officer of the <ORG> or the public authority to make Rules framed under the provisions of a statute form part of the statute Therefore <ORG> again went wrong by invoking the principle of promissory estoppel to allow the petition filed by the respondents herein In the aforesaid case the State of Punjab had come up in appeal against the order passed by <ORG> quashing the demand raised by the State of Punjab for purchase tax on milk for the period The Financial Commissioner in its memo dated addressed to <ORG> had written that it has been decided in principle to abolish purchase tax on milk with effect from Since there was nothing in law which prohibited it from doing so <ORG> was held bound to act upon its representation and exempt the milk from purchase tax for the relevant period It was held that no representation could be enforced which is prohibited by law but this principle would not be applicable to the cases where there is power under the statute to grant exemption There is no provision in the Act and the Rules framed thereunder enabling the <ORG> to re convey the land acquired to implement a scheme for forming of sites and their allotment as per rules It cannot be invoked to compel the Government to do an act prohibited by law This is also not a case where the appellant altered its position pursuant to or in furtherance of a promise made to it by the <ORG> Such promise however must be made by the persons who have the power to implement the representation We do not find any force in the submission Section A of the City of Bangalore Improvement Act provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act during a period of fifteen years from the date of commencement of the Act the Government may acquire the land under the Mysore Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of improvement expansion or development of the City of Bangalore or any area to which this Act extends and any land so acquired after it has vested in the Government stand transferred to the Board and such land may be dealt with under the provisions of Sections and or in such manner as the Government may direct Power of <ORG> to acquire hold and dispose of property The <ORG> shall for the purposes of this Act have power to acquire and hold movable and immovable property whether within or outside City First part of Clause of Section provides that the <ORG> shall have the power for the purpose of the Act to acquire and hold movable and immovable property whether within or outside the city The first part deals with the power of the <ORG> to lease sell or otherwise transfer any movable or immovable property which belongs to it and second to appropriate or apply any land vested in or acquired by it for the formation of open spaces or for the building purposes or in any other manner for the purpose of any improvement scheme It cannot be used for any purpose other than for which it was acquired which in the present case was for formation of open spaces or for building purposes and since the land was acquired for the purpose of forming sites it could only be used for the purpose of forming sites and their allotment There is no power as per this provision to re convey the lands which have been acquired under a scheme for forming sites The power of the <ORG> to lease or sell or transfer the sites was made subject to the restrictions conditions and limitations which may be prescribed by the Rules In the Rules framed there is no provision for re conveying the land and therefore power does not vest in the <ORG> to re convey the lands which were acquired for formation of sites in an improvement scheme The arguments raised based on Section of the BDA Act therefore has no force and hence rejected But all proceedings thereafter including the final notification and the subsequent proceedings were under the Land Acquisition Act <ORG> in the impugned order has taken the view applying the principle laid down in Section of the General Clauses Act which provides that power to issue the notification order or rules or bye laws would include the power to add amend vary or rescind any notification order rule or bye law held that where the authority is vested with the power to do something then it is entrusted with the power to undo it as well Since the State Government had the power to acquire the land it has the power to release the land from acquisition as well In our considered view <ORG> has erred in holding that <ORG> could release the lands in exercise of its power under Section of the Land Acquisition Act from the acquisition Governor of Himachal Pradesh Vs Sri <NAME> SCC has held in para as under Power to cancel a notification for compulsory acquisition is it is true not affected by Section of the Act by a notification under Section of the General Clauses Act the Government may cancel or rescind the notification issued under Sections and of the Land Acquisition Act It is clearly implicit in the observations that after possession has been taken pursuant to a notification under Section the land is vested in the <ORG> and the notification cannot be cancelled under Section of the General Clauses Act nor can the notification be withdrawn in exercise of the powers under Section of the Land Acquisition Act Any other view would enable the State <ORG> to circumvent the specific provision by relying upon a general power When possession of the land is taken under Section the land vests in the <ORG> There is no provision by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> reverts to the original owner by mere cancellation of the notification Again in <NAME> Vs State of Rajasthan SCC it was reiterated that once the possession is taken and the land vests in the <ORG> then the <ORG> cannot withdraw from acquisition under Section of the Land Acquisition Act The possession of the land in question was taken in the year after the passing of the award by the Land Acquisition Officer Thereafter the land vested in the <ORG> which was then transferred to <ORG> predecessor in interest of the appellant After the vesting of the land and taking possession thereof the notification for acquiring the land could not be withdrawn or cancelled in exercise of powers under Section of the Land Acquisition Act Power under Section of the General Clauses Act cannot be exercised after vesting of the land statutorily in the State <ORG> After making the award under Section the Collector can take possession of the land under Section which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances This brings us to the last contention raised by the counsel for the respondent We do not agree with the contention raised by the counsel for the respondent that the directions issued by the Chief Minister through his note were binding on the <ORG> or that the <ORG> was bound in law to re convey the land in terms of the directions issued in the impugned judgment Under Section the <ORG> can give such directions to the authority which in its opinion are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purpose of the Act Directions issued by the Chief Minister in the present case would not be to carry out the purpose of the Act rather it would be to destroy the same Since we are setting aside the impugned judgment the <ORG> as per directions issued by the Chief Minister cannot re convey the land to the respondent in terms of the decision rendered by <ORG> in the impugned judgment i Writ Appeal No of It is not in dispute that Section of the Land Acquisition Act would apply to the acquisitions made under the Act and in that view of the matter the <ORG> could exercise its jurisdiction for re conveyance of the property in favour of the owner thereof only in the event possession thereof had not been taken It has been accepted before us that Section of the General Clauses Act has no application but reliance has been sought to be placed on Section of the Act which empowers the <ORG> to issue such directions to the authority as in its opinion are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purpose of the Act The power of the <ORG> <ORG> being circumscribed by the conditions precedent laid down therein and thus the directions can be issued only when the same are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purpose of the Act Recently in <ORG> Vs Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself We may here draw attention to the observations of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> has been constituted for specific purposes It can ordinarily exercise its power under Section of the Act where a policy matter is involved It has not been established that the Chief Minister had the requisite jurisdiction to issue such a direction Section of the Act contemplates an order by the State On adding of interest and statutory allowances the amount would come approximately to Rs As the st respondent has been deprived of the amount due for quite some time we direct the appellant to re deposit the entire amount within three months from today The judgment under appeal is set aside and that of the Single Judge is restored Parties shall bear their own costs
