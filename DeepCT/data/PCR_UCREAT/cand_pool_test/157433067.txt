The respondent herein filed No before the <ORG><ORG><ORG> Poonamallee for a declaration that the schedule property mentioned in the schedule is his absolute property and for directing the st defendant Revision Petitioner to put the the decree holder respondent in vacant possession of the suit property By judgment and decree dated the trial court decreed the suit for title and dismissed the same for possession The respondent plaintiff herein alone filed an appeal in A No before this <ORG> and <ORG> of this <ORG> by its elaborate judgment dated allowed the appeal and granted the decree for possession also He further submitted that the Revision Petitioner had no occasion to bring it to the notice of the court during the hearing of the suit and appeal about the fraud played by the decree holder against the courts and other authorities which came to light when he took steps to obey and to give effect to the decree in the suit Under Section of the Code all questions arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of decree have got to be determined by the court executing the decree and not by a separate suit Powers of the second appellate court under different statutes like Section of the Code as it stood before its amendment by Central Act of with effect from The powers of this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution of India should not be exercised simply because substantial question of law arises in a case but there is further requirement that such question must be of general public importance and it requires decision of this <ORG> Powers of revision under Section of the Code cannot be exercised merely because the order suffers from legal infirmity or substantial question of law arises but such an error must suffer with the vice of error of jurisdiction It does not mean that in each and every case the revisional court is obliged to consider questions of facts as well like a first appellate court but the court has discretion to consider the same in appropriate cases whenever it is found expedient and not in each and every case Powers of review cannot be invoked unless it is shown that there is error apparent on the face of the record in the order sought to be reviewed Thus it is plain that executing court can allow objection under Section of the Code to the executability of the decree if it is found that the same is void ab initio and nullity apart from the ground that the decree is not capable of execution under law either because the same was passed in ignorance of such a provision of law or the law was promulgated making a decree inexecutable after its passing The validity or otherwise of a decree may be challenged by filing a properly constituted suit or taking any other remedy available under law on the ground that the original defendant absented himself from the proceedings of the suit after appearance as he had no longer any interest in the subject of dispute or did not purposely take interest in the proceedings or colluded with the adversary or any other ground permissible under law The executing court can allow objections under Section of the Code to the executability of the decree if it is found that the same is void ab initio and a nullity apart from the ground that the decree is not capable of execution under law either because the same was obtained passed in ignorance of such a provision of law or the law as promulgated making the decree in executable after its passing The crucial expression in Section is All questions arising between the parties to the suit or their representatives In the light of the well settled legal principles let me examine the case on hand The revision petitioner herein filed application on the ground that the respondent herein did not have proper title and the documents he filed before the trial court to prove the title are bogus documents The court below has considered the entire facts and rightly came to the conclusion that all the documents relied on by the revision petitioner related to his defence in relation to the declaration relief sought for by the respondent herein which was already held against the petitioner In such circumstances I do not find any merit in the Revision Petition and the same is liable to be dismissed
