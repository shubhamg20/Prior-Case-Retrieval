HEADNOTE The Newspaper Price and Page Act empowered <ORG> to regulate the prices of newspapers in relation to their pages and sizes and to regulate the allocation of space for advertising matter The freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art For propagating his ideas a citizen had the right to publish them to disseminate them and to circulate them either by word of mouth or by writing September The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR A matter of far reaching importance affecting the freedom of the press is raised in these three petitions wherein the constitutionality of the Newspaper Price and Page Act and the Daily Newspaper Price and Page Order is questioned The first petition is by a private limited company carrying on business inter alia of publishing daily and weekly newspapers in Marathi named <ORG> from Poona and by two persons who are the only shareholders in that company It is claimed on behalf of the petitioners that one of the special features of the newspaper is coverage of foreign news and despatches on foreign affairs It is claimed on behalf of the petitioners that this paper is not aligned with any political party and that upon controversial questions the public look up to it for impartial appraisement of the issues involved and for guidance The petitioners point out that since the total number of pages which <ORG> gives to its reading public on six days in a week is and that as a result of the impugned Order they will either have to raise its price from nP According to them the Order would have the effect of either compelling them to increase the price or to reduce the number of pages of practically every newspaper in the country as also of preventing them from publishing supplements without extraneous restrictions which they are able to do at present It is further pointed out that all newspapers publish advertisements and that this is a trading activity Placing reliance upon the statement contained in the Report of the Press Commission it is contended on behalf of the respondent that newspapers of long standing which have built up a large and stable advertisement revenue being in a more advantageous Position than newcomers in the field of journalism are in a position to squeeze out such newcomers with the result that they are able to destroy the freedom of expression of others It is further pointed out on behalf of the respondent that the diminution of advertisement revenue which would result from the operation of the Price Page Schedule cannot be regarded as an infringement of the right under Art It is pointed out on behalf of the respondent that the quantity of import of newsprint is based on the average number of pages of newspapers published in and that therefore no newspaper has the unrestricted right to increase the number of pages over the figure It is also pointed out that the draft Price Page Schedule has been approved by <ORG> and that this <ORG> has recommended that the life of the Price Page Act and Order should be extended by another five to ten years It is denied that the provisions of the Act infringe the rights conferred by Art In order to appreciate fully the contentions raised before us it would be useful to give in brief a summary of the provisions of the Act and of the impugned Order Sub section of provides that the Act shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of five years from its commencement except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the expiration The Act came into force on September and was thus due to expire on September It is this provision which empowers <ORG> to regulate prices and pages of newspapers It also empowers the <ORG> to regulate the allocation of space to be allotted for advertising matter It will thus be seen that the Act can be brought into practical operation only after <ORG> has taken action under sub of and made an order regulating any of the matters referred to in that section Then there is a proviso to this paragraph which runs thus Provided that where there is a weekly edition of any newspaper referred to in clause and the price charged therefor is different from that charged on other days the total number of pages of all the issues of that newspaper published during a week shall not exceed the maximum number of pares assigned to such newspaper under paragraph and five sixths of the maximum number of pages assigned to it under paragraph Our Constitution does not expressly provide for the freedom of press but it has been held by this <ORG> that this freedom is included in freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by cl a of Art That clause runs thus Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restric tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interests of the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence For the purpose of propagating his ideas every citizen has a right to publish them to disseminate them and to circulate them It must be borne in mind that the Constitution must be interpreted in a broad way and not in a narrow and pedantic sense On the other hand the <ORG> must interpret the Constitution in a manner which would enable the citizen to enjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest measure subject of course to permissible restrictions Bearing this principle in mind it would be clear that the right to freedom of speech and expression carries with it the right to publish and circulate one ideas opinions and views with complete freedom and by resorting to any available means of publication subject again to such restrictions as could be legitimately imposed under cl of Art this <ORG> held that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propagation of ideas and that this freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation Then in paragraph it is observed There is another instance illustrating the effect of selling price on the circulation Nevertheless it cannot be denied that a change in price did have a profound effect on the circulation of those two papers It is however said that it is not necessary for newspapers to raise their prices but that they could reduce their number of pages We would consider this matter in another way also If on the other hand the space for advertisement is reduced the earnings of a newspaper would go down and it would either have to run at a loss or close down or raise its price The right to freedom of speech and expression is an individual right guaranteed to every citizen by Art There is nothing in el It was however contended on behalf of the <ORG> that there are two aspects of the activities of newspapers the dissemination of news and views and the commercial aspect restrictions can be placed on the latter right in the interest of the general public reads thus Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause It may well be within the power of the <ORG> to place in the interest of the general public restrictions upon the right of a citizen to carry on business but it is not open to the <ORG> to achieve this object by directly and immediately curtailing any other freedom of that citizen guaranteed by the Constitution and which is not susceptible of abridgement on the same grounds as are Bet out in cl of Art Viewing the question from this angle it would be seen that the reference to the Press being a business and to the restriction imposed by the impugned Act being referable or justified as a proper restriction on the right to carry on the business of publishing a newspaper would be wholly irrelevant for considering whether the impugned Act infringes or does not infringe the freedom guaranteed by Art If this were so the fact that the legislation achieves the same result by means of the schedule of rates makes no difference and the impact on the freedom would still be direct notwithstanding that it does not appear so on its face It seeks to achieve its object of enabling what are termed the smaller newspapers to secure larger circulation by provisions which without disguise are aimed at restricting the circulation of what are termed the larger papers with better financial strength Accordingly we allow this petition with costs
