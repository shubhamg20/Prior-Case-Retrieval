Tripartite agreements were also executed between the buyer the seller and the foreign company recognizing the buyer as the registered or licensed user of the trademarks authorising the seller to affix the trade marks on the products manufactured as an agent for and on behalf of the buyer and not of his own account and the right of the buyer being reserved to revoke the authority given to the seller to affix the trade marks The respondent filed declaration for the purposes of the levy of excise under the Central Excises and Salt Act showing the wholesale prices of different classes of goods sold by it during the period May to May According to the Assistant Collector the buyer was the manufacturer of goods and not the seller The Collector of Central Excise allowed the appeals of the respondent and accepted the plea that the wholesale price disclosed by the seller was the proper basis for determining the excise duty According to <ORG> the buyer is the person engaged in the production of the goods and the seller merely manufactures them on behalf of the buyer and that under the agreements the seller is required to affix the trade marks of the buyer on the manufactured goods and that indicates that the goods belong to the buyer <ORG> held that the goods were manufactured by the seller as its own goods and therefore the wholesale price charged by the seller must form the true basis for the levy of excise duty The goods are manufactured by the seller on its own account and the seller sells the goods with the trade marks affixed on them to the buyer The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgments and orders of the Gujarat high Court allowing two writ petitions preferred by the respondent challenging the levy of excise duty As they raise identical questions of law for consideration they are disposed by a common judgment The respondent is a company limited by shares The buyer reserved the right to revoke the authority given to the seller to affix the trade mark The respondent filed a declaration for the purposes of the levy of excise under the <ORG>s and Salt Act showing the wholesale prices of different classes of goods sold by it during the period May to May The respondent filed a writ petition in <ORG> against the orders of <ORG> and <ORG> held that <ORG> was wrong and the appellate Collector was right on the question as to the liability of the seller to excise duty The basis on which <ORG> proceeded in holding that the wholesale price of the goods should be the wholesale price charged by the buyer is that the goods were manufactured by the seller on behalf of the buyer specially as they were embossed with the trade mark of which the buyer alone was the registered user in India that the two agreements between the seller and the buyer envisaged that the goods were manufactured by the seller on behalf of the buyer and that therefore the buyer itself should be regarded as the manufacturer of the goods for the purpose of levying excise duty <ORG> has differed from the view taken by <ORG> and has held that the goods were manufactured by the seller as its own goods and therefore the wholesale price charged by the seller must form the true basis for the levy of excise duty Excise duty is levied under of the Central Excises and Salt Act on goods manufactured in India and broadly for the purposes of computing the duty the value of the article is deemed under of the Act as it stood before its amendment by Act XXII of to be the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory for delivery at the place of manufacture The appellant contends that on the facts and circumstances of this case it must be held that the buyer is the person engaged in the production of the goods and the seller merely manufactures them on behalf of the buyer If the manufactured goods are not in accordance with the buyer standard they are either reprocessed to bring them up to the requisite quality or if that is not possible the goods are sold to the buyer for a different purpose if they are compatible with the specifications of some other product and provided that the buyer has a need for that product or the goods are sold to others in the market as sub standard goods at a lower price of the goods are destroyed It seems to us clear from the record that the trade marks of the buyer are to be affixed on those goods only which are found to conform to the specifications or standard stipulated by the buyer The goods are manufactured by the seller on its own account and the seller sells the goods with the trade marks affixed on them to the buyer but in none of those observations do we find any acceptable support for the proposition that the goods are manufactured by the seller on behalf of the buyer In the result we hold that <ORG> is right in concluding that the wholesale price of the goods manufactured by the seller is the wholesale price at which it sells those goods to the buyer and it is not the wholesale price at which the buyer sells those goods to others The appeals are dismissed with costs
