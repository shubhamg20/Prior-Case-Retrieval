HEADNOTE Section a iii of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act empowers <ORG> to enquire into any restrictive trade practices upon an application made to it by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements Section provides that any person aggrieved by an order made by <ORG> or the <ORG> under or may prefer an appeal to <ORG> on one or more of the grounds specified in Code of Civil Procedure On the date on which the Act came into force specified three grounds on which a second appeal could lie to <ORG> one of them being that the decision appealed against was contrary to law By an amendment made in was substituted by a new section which provides that a second appeal shall lie to <ORG> only if <ORG> is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law The appellant who was a manufacturer of jeep motor vehicles their spare parts and accessories submitted for registration to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements standard distributorship agreements entered into by it with its distributors The appellant in reply to the <ORG> notice stated that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the <ORG> pointing out at the same time that there was nothing in the impugned clauses of the agreement which could be said to constitute restrictive trade practices the reasons whereof had already been explained in its reply Thereupon the appellant made an application to the <ORG> pointing out that it did not contest the enquiry proceedings under in the first instance because the <ORG> decision in the <ORG> case was directly applicable but now that that decision had been reversed by <ORG> in appeal its order dated May needed amendment modification In its appeal under of the Act impugning the <ORG> order dated th February the appellant contended that the Registrar application alleging restrictive trade practices did not set out any facts showing how the appellant trade practices were restrictive in nature and that the Registrar application not having been made in accordance with the law laid down by this <ORG> in <ORG> case the impugned order of the <ORG> was liable to be revoked or modified under the order did not give any reasons for its decision and so was vitiated and the order was a continuing order because it required the appellant not merely to cease but also desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and was therefore required to be continually justifiable and since it was contrary to the law laid down in <ORG> case it was liable to be revoked or amended in any event the decision of this <ORG> being subsequent to the making of the <ORG> order there was enough justification for revoking or modifying the order under of the Act The respondent on the other hand contended that on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in or the General Clauses Act reference in to must be construed as a reference to the new and so construed an appeal to <ORG> would lie only if the case involved a substantial question of law and not otherwise and since in this case no such question was involved the appeal was not maintainable could not be used by the appellant as a substitute for and by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the <ORG> order and unconditionally accepting it the appellant was precluded from raising any contention against its validity in appeal to this <ORG> In any event the present appeal raises substantial questions of law and so is maintainable There is a distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation Where there is a mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation of the General Clause Act applies and the repeal and re enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re enacted Once the incorporation is made the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute It found that the grounds set out in the then existing CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in without knowing what those grounds were Even assuming that the right of appeal under is restricted to the ground specified in the new CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of of the Act The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this <ORG> or by <ORG> or by the Federal <ORG> or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views In the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act because the interpretation of directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this <ORG> This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power An order made under or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the <ORG> but also others such as the whole net work of distributors or dealers who were not before the <ORG> There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which if taken into account may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad the order of the <ORG> is transient or pro tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance Clearly therefore even if a case does not fall within and XLVII the <ORG> would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under Therefore even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant In the <ORG> case this <ORG> laid down that an application by the Registrar under a iii must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting varying adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition In a case where a clause in agreement does not by itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition the mere possibility of action being taken which may be restrictive of competition would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view The order dated th May was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it The two conditions precedent before the <ORG> can pass a cease and desist order are i it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and ii where such a finding is reached the <ORG> must be satisfied that none of the gateways pleaded in answer to the complaint exists The order dated th May did not contain any discussion showing that the <ORG> had reached the requisite satisfaction It gave merely bald directions without any reasons The judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by <ORG> This appeal under section of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act hereinafter referred to as the Act raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows The appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories The material clauses of this agreement read as follows Section TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR The Company grants to Distributor the non exclusive privilege except as hereinafter provided of selling at re tail and the right except hereinafter provided to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section of this agreement within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused <ORG> Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which have been purchased by <ORG> from the Company within a period of thirty days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such <ORG> Motor Vehicle less all allowance thereto granted and the net amount which would have been paid had such <ORG> motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price No allowance how ever shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price The Registrar drew the attention of the <ORG> to clauses and of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie up sales full line forcing exclusive dealing granting or allowing concessions discounts over riding commission etc The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the <ORG> be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant under section of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper The <ORG> on receipt of this application decided in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections a and of the Act to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated nd January under Regulation of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices <ORG> Regulations hereinafter referred to as the Regulations to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the <ORG> it should comply with the requirements of Regulations and failing which the <ORG> would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section of the Act Legal made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations and it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar No other evidence oral or documentary was produced by the Registrar and the <ORG> proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar The Respondent shall within months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the <ORG> setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to Since the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl of the Order the appellant filed an affidavit dated th September stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs and of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the <ORG> The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated th September seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the <ORG> were not enforceable in law by the appellant it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order it was not necessary to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement It seems that there was a hearing before the <ORG> on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the <ORG> the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the <ORG> by its Order dated th December directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by st March Though this decision was given on st January it was not fully reported until March and on reading it the appellant felt that the order of the <ORG> dated th May required reconsideration as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision The appellant accordingly made an application to the <ORG> on st March where besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section in the first instance because the decision given by the <ORG> in the <ORG> case was directly applicable but since that decision of the <ORG> was reversed by this Court in appeal the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and or modification of the Order dated th May and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions if any The appellant thereafter made an application dated th May under section of the Act read with Regulation for revocation amendment or modification of the Order of the <ORG> dated th May This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section challenging the validity of the order made by the <ORG> rejecting the application of the appellant Restrictive trade practice is defiled in section clause to mean a grade practice which has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition in any manner and in particular i which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production or ii which tends to bring about manipulation of prices or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in It however appears that <ORG> paid scant regard to this legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as th August it failed to make appointment of Chairman until th February Turning back to the provisions of the Act we find that section a iii empowers the <ORG> to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar The powers of the <ORG> while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section and section sub section provides that any order made by the <ORG> may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made Then follow sections to which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the <ORG> We are not concerned with Sections to which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices Sub section of section provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section sub section shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration These circumstances specified in sub section of section render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as gateways out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices Section is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by <ORG> under Ch III or Ch IV or as the case may be of the <ORG> under section or section may within days from the date of the order prefer an appeal to <ORG> on one or more of the grounds specified in section of the Code of Civil Procedure This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant The last section to which we must refer is section which confers power on the <ORG> to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act The <ORG> has in exercise of the power conferred by this section made the Regulations of which three arc material An application under sub section of section of the Act for amendment or revocation of any order made by the <ORG> in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies Unless the <ORG> otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure shall as far as may be applied to these proceedings It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal The contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated th May suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section of the Act It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated th May was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the <ORG> case and no order could be made upon it by the <ORG> It was also urged that there was no material placed before the <ORG> by the Registrar on the basis of which the <ORG> could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices Even if the <ORG> was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted but apart from the impugned clauses no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated th May could be made by the <ORG> It was also contended that the Order dated th May did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices it was a non speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity The appellant further urged that the Order dated th May was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was therefore required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices the Order dated th May was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section It was submitted that in any event the Order dated th May was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the <ORG> case and since the decision in the <ORG> case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order it justified the invocation of the power under section for revoking or modifying the Order Lastly it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated th May in that <ORG> started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section read with the newly substituted section of the Code of Civil Procedure an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law the appeal was not maintainable The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section read with Regulation the <ORG> could revoke or amend the Order dated th May only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule of the Code of Civil Procedure was available to the appellant But said the respondents there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated th May was concerned nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section was not attracted It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated th May by an application under Section by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the <ORG> under section may prefer an appeal to this Court on one or more of the grounds specified in section of the Code of Civil Procedure Now at the date when section was enacted namely th December being the date of coming into force of the Act section of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to <ORG> and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law It was sufficient under section as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of <ORG> in second appeal and therefore if the reference in section were to the grounds set out in the then existing section there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section on a question of law But subsequent to the enactment of section section of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section of the Code of Civil Procedure Amendment Act with effect from st February and the new section provided that a second appeal shall lie to <ORG> only if <ORG> is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground namely that there should be a substantial question of law This was the new section which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was therefore required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law The respondents leaned heavily on section of the General Clauses Act which provides Where this Act or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act repeals and re enacts with or without modification any provision of a former enactment then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall un less a different intention appears be construed as references to the provision so re enacted and contended that the substitution of the new section amounted to repeal and re enactment of the former section and therefore on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section the reference in section to section must be construed as reference to the new section and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section that is on a substantial question of law Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation section applies and the repeal and re enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re enacted Once the incorporation is made the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute there is a rule of construction that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second This was the rule applied by <ORG> in Secretary of <ORG> for India in <ORG> <ORG> pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act and become an integral part of it the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act by the addition of sub section in section had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act and could not be read into it There the question arose in regard to the interpretation of section of the Bihar and Orissa Motor Vehicles Taxation Act hereinafter referred to as the Taxation Act This section when enacted adopted the definition of motor vehicle contained in section of the Motor Vehicles Act Subsequently section was amended by Act of but no corresponding amendment was made in the definition contained in section Or the Taxation Act It is therefore clear that if there is mere reference to a provision of one statute in another without incorporation then unless a different intention clearly appears section would apply and the reference would be construed as a reference to the provision as may be in force from time to time in the former statute We have no doubt that section is all instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference Section provides for an appeal to this Court on one or more or the grounds specified in section Those were the grounds which were before the <ORG> and to which the <ORG> could have applied its mind and it is reasonable to assume that it was with reference to those specific and known grounds that the legislature intended to restrict the right of appeal The <ORG> could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in section without knowing what those grounds were The grounds specified in section might be changed from time to time having regard to the legislative policy relating to second appeals and it is difficult to see any valid reason why the <ORG> should have thought it necessary that these changes should also be reflected in section which deals with the right of appeal in a totally different context We fail to appreciate what relevance the legislative policy in regard to second appeals has to the right of appeal under section so that section should be inseparably linked or yoked to section and whatever changes take place in section must be automatically read into section It must be remembered that the Act is a self contained Code dealing with monopolies and restrictive trade practices and it is not possible to believe that the <ORG> could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the vicissitudes through which a section in another statute might pass from time to time We must therefore hold that on a proper interpretation the grounds specified in the then existing section were incorporated in section and the substitution of the new section did not affect or restrict the grounds as incorporated and since the present appeal admittedly raises questions of law it is clearly maintainable under section We may point out that even if the right of appeal under section were restricted to the ground specified in the new section the present appeal would still be maintainable since it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of section and it has been held that the proper test would be whether the question of law is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so whether it is either an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by <ORG> or by <ORG> or is not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternative views The question of interpretation of section which arises in the present appeal directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court and it is therefore clearly a substantial question of law within the meaning of this test We must therefore reject the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents against the maintainability of the present appeal That takes us to a consideration of the merits of the appeal and the first question that arises on the merits is as to the true scope and magnitude of the curial power conferred on the <ORG> under section They have no bearing on the content of the power granted under section or on its scope and ambit Now one thing is clear that the power conferred under section is a corrective or rectificatory power and it is conferred in terms of widest amplitude There are no fetters placed by the <ORG> to inhibit the width and amplitude of the power and in this respect it is unlike section of the English Restrictive Trade Practices Act which limits the power of the <ORG> under that section to discharge a previous order made by it by providing in terms clear and explicit that leave to make an application for discharging the previous order shall not be granted except on prima facie evidence of material change in the relevant circumstances This provision is markedly absent in section and not express limitation is placed on the power conferred under that section It is left to the discretion of the <ORG> whether the power should be exercised in a given case and if so to what extent Every case of an application under section would have to be decided on its own distinctive facts and the <ORG> would have to find whether it is a proper case in which having regard to the relevant consideration the order made by it should be amended or revoked The fact that an appeal lies against the order under section but has not been preferred would be no ground for refusing to exercise the power under section The power conferred on the <ORG> under section is an independent power which has nothing to do with the appellate power under section There is no question of using section as a substitute for section It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under section is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the <ORG> to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases It is also possible that there may be some fact or circumstance which may not have been brought to the attention of the <ORG> though having a crucial bearing on the determination of the inquiry and which if taken into account may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad and in such cases too some provision has to be made for correcting or rectifying the order It is by its very nature transient or pro tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstances It is a curial power intended to ensure that the Order passed by the <ORG> is and continues to be in confirmity with the requirements of the Act and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restric tive trade practice and it must therefore be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate to the object and purpose of the grant of the power This provision merely lays down a rule of procedure and it has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under section may be maintained and it is difficult to see how it can be pressed into service on behalf of the respondents The second part states that unless the <ORG> otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section and Order XLVII rule of the Code of Civil Procedure shall as far as may be applied to these proceedings they are not applicable they may be ignored but that does not mean that the power conferred under section would not be exercisable in such a case The reference to the provisions of section and Order XLVII rule does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under section It is therefore clear to our mind that even if a case does not fall within section and Order XLVII rule the <ORG> would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it If for example a strong case is made out showing that an order made under section is plainly erroneous in law or that some vital fact or feature which would tilt the decision the other way has escaped the attention of the <ORG> in making the order or that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing at the hearing of the inquiry resulting in the order being passed exparte the <ORG> would be entitled to interfere in the exercise of its power under section Before we proceed to consider whether any case has been made out by the appellant for the exercise of the power under section we may briefly dispose of the contention of the respondents based on acquiescence and estoppel We do not see anything in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise any estoppel against it Otherwise there is no reason why the appellant should not have entered an appearance under Regulation and filed a proper reply as provided in Regulation and appeared at the hearing of the inquiry to oppose the application of the Registrar Be that as it may the <ORG> declined to consider he submissions of the appellant and proceeded to make the order dated th May exparte in the absence of the appellant However before the extended date was due to expiry this <ORG> reversed the decision of The <ORG> in the <ORG> case and as soon as this new fact or circumstance came to its knowledge the appellant made an application dated st March stating that in view of the decision given by this <ORG> in the <ORG> case the applicant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and or modification of the Order dated th May and the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should therefore be further extended and on this application the <ORG> granted further extension of time upto th June The appellant undoubtedly asked for extension of time from the <ORG> for the purpose of implementing the Order dated th May but that also cannot amount to acquiescence because until the decision of the <ORG> in the <ORG> case was reversed in appeal by this <ORG> the appellant had no reason to believe that the Order dated th May was erroneous and as soon as the appellant came to know about the decision of this <ORG> reversing the view taken by the <ORG> the appellant immediately pointed out to the <ORG> that it was moving an application for amendment or revocation of the Order dated th May under section Moreover it may be noted that the appellant did not right upto the time it made the application under section implement the Order dated th May by entering into revised distributorship agreement with the distributors Nor could there be any estoppel against the appellant precluding it from challenging the Order by an application under section for estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding has altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another and here there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant That takes us straight to the consideration of the question whether the appellant has made out any case for the exercise of the power of the <ORG> under section The application must set out facts or features to show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of facts The application of the Registrar in the present case was therefore clearly contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the <ORG> case There was no material at all produced by the Registrar before the <ORG> which would show how having regard to the facts or features of the trade of the appellant the trade practices set out in the offending clauses of the distributorship agreement were restrictive trade practices We do not think there is any force in this contention of the respondents and the Order dated th May must be held to be bad on the ground that it was based on no material and could not possibly have been made by the <ORG> It is now settled law as a result of the decision of this <ORG> in the <ORG> case that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily a restrictive trade practice It defines restrictive trade practice to mean a trade practice which has or may have the effected of preventing distorting or restricting competition in any manner and in clauses i and ii particularises two specific instances of trade practices which fall within the category of restrictive trade practice That section provides that every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is hereby declared to be illegal and literally applied it would outlaw every conceivable contract which could be made concerning trade or commerce or the subjects of such commerce It was held by the <ORG> as a rule of reason that the term restraint of trade means that it meant at common law and in the law of the United States when the Sherman Act was passed and it covered only those acts or contracts or agreements or combinations which prejudice public interest by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the due course of trade or which injuriously restrain trade either because of their inherent nature of effect or because of their evident purpose <ORG> also United States <ORG> It was pointed out that the rule of reason does not freeze the meaning of restraint of trade to what it meant at the date when the Sherman Act was passed and it prohibits not only those acts deemed to be undue restraints of trade at common law but also those acts which new times and economic conditions make unreasonable The rule of reason has to quote again the words of the same learned Judge given a workable content to anti trust legislation To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied its condition before and after the restraint was imposed the nature of the restraint and its effect actual or probable It will thus be seen that the rule of reason normally requires an ascertainment of the facts or features peculiar to the particular business its condition before and after the restraint was imposed the nature of the restraint and its effect actual or probable the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose or end sought to be attained and it is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act contract or agreement impos ing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade Of course it must be pointed out that there may be trade practices which are such that by their inherent nature and inevitable effect they necessarily impair competition and in case of such trade practices it would not be necessary to consider any other facts or circumstances for they would be per se restrictive trade practices Even in the United States a similar doctrine of per se illegality has been evolved in the interpretation of section of the Sherman Act and it has been held that certain restraints of trade are unreasonable per se and because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use There is no doubt that the appellant by its letter dated th May submitted the distributorship agreement to the Registrar for registration under section but we do not see how this act of the appellant or the letter forwarding the distributorship agreement for registration can be construed as admission on the part of the appellant that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses of the distributorship agreement constituted restrictive trade practices Therefore even if there was any admission involved in submitting the distributorship agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the inquiry under section There is nothing in the letter of the appellant to show which were the particular clauses of the distributorship agreement regarded by the appellant as restrictive trade practices on the basis of which it made the application for registration It is possible that the appellant might have taken the same view which the <ORG> did in the <ORG> case namely that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of section the trade practice must irrespective of whether it falls within the definition in section or not be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered and on that view the appellant might have submitted the distributorship agreement for registration There was accordingly no admission of the appellant on which the <ORG> could rely for the purpose of making the Order dated th May When the commission passed the Order dated th May the decision of the <ORG> in the <ORG> case held the field and according to that decision any trade practice which fall within one of the clauses of section would be a restrictive trade practice and that is perhaps the reason why the Registrar did not produce any material before the <ORG> and even though there was no material before it the <ORG> proceeded to invalidate the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses as restrictive trade practices since they fell within one or the other clauses of section Before we part with this aspect of the case we must refer to other decision of this <ORG> which was relied upon on behalf of the respondents and that is the decision in <ORG> <NAME> The Judgment in this case was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> speaking on behalf of himself and <NAME> and though <NAME> <NAME> was also a party to the judgment in the <ORG> case this judgment seem to strike a slightly different note and hence it is necessary to examine it in some detail One was clause which in its last portion provided that the redistribution stockists shall purchase and accept from the <ORG> such stock as the <ORG> shall at its discretion send to the redistribution stockist for fulfilling its obligations under the agreement and the other was Clause which imposed a restriction as to area or market by providing that the redistribution stockist shall not rebook or in any way convey transport or despatch parts of stocks of the products received by him outside the town for which he was appointed redistribution stockist The <ORG> held following the view taken by it earlier in the <ORG> case that the last part of clause as well as clause constituted restrictive trade practices and declared them void This view was affirmed by <NAME> <NAME> in the appeal preferred by <ORG> We are not concerned with the merits of the question whether the last part of clause and clause were on the facts of that case rightly held to be restrictive trade practices but certain observations made by the learned Chief Justice in that judgment call for consideration since they seem to be inconsistent with what was laid down by a Bench of three Judges of this <ORG> in the <ORG> Case It is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged in the light of the various considerations adverted to by us and there is no question of contradicting varying adding to or subtracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting any extraneous evidence The reliance placed by the learned Chief Justice on sections and was therefore quite inappropriate and unjustified and we do not think that the learned Chief Justice was right in shutting out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practices impugned in the case before him There were two places in the judgment where the learned Chief Justice used expressions indicating this view This view is plainly and again we say with the greatest respect contrary to the law laid down by a Bench of three Judges of this Court in the <ORG> case We have already pointed out that according to the decision in the <ORG> case a trade practice does not become a restrictive trade practice merely because it falls within one or the other clause of section but it must also satisfy the definition of restrictive trade practice contained in section and it is only then that the agreement relating to it would require to be registered under section It is not section which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in section which makes it void The view taken by the learned Chief Justice on this point can not therefore be accepted Lastly the learned Chief Justice held that the introduction of a clause in an agreement itself constitutes a trade practice and if such clause confers power which can be used so as to unjustifiably restrict trade it would constitute a restrictive trade practice The interpretation placed by the learned Chief Justice was that if a clause in an agreement is capable of being used to prevent distort or restrict competition in any manner it would be liable to be struck down as a restrictive trade practice regardless of what is actually done under it for it is not the action taken under a clause but the clause itself which permits action to be taken which is unduly restrictive of competition that is material for determining whether there is a restrictive trade practice The learned Chief Justice emphasised that if a clause in an agreement confers power to act in a manner which would unduly restrict trade the clause would be illegal and it would be no answer to say that the clause is in fact being implemented in a lawful manner Therefore whenever a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice embodied in the clause that has to be examined for the purpose of determining its actual or probable effect on competition There would be no difficulty in such a case in applying the definition of restrictive trade practice in accordance with the law laid down in the <ORG> case as explained by us in this judgment Such a broad and general clause cannot be faulted as restrictive of competition for it cannot he assumed that the manufacturer or supplier will abuse the power conferred by the clause by giving directions unduly restricting trade The material question to consider is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition There can be no hard and fast rule and each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view for the purpose Or determining whether the clause has the actual or probable effect of unduly restricting come petition We cannot accept the proposition that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice There is also another infirmity invalidating the Order dated th May We have already pointed out and that is clear from the decision of this Court in the <ORG> case that in an inquiry under the <ORG> has first to be satisfied that the trade practice com plained of in the application is a restrictive trade practice within the meaning of that expression as defined in section and it is by after the <ORG> is so satisfied that it can proceed to consider whether any of the gateways provided in section exists so that the trade practice though found restrictive is deemed not to be prejudicial to the public interest and if no such gateways are established then only it can proceed to make an order directing that the trade practice complained of shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated There are thus two conditions precedent which must be satisfied before a cease and desist order can be made by the <ORG> in regard to any trade practice complained of before it The Order dated th May did not contain any discussion or recital showing that the <ORG> had reached the requisite satisfaction in regard to the offending trade practices But we can legitimately presume that the <ORG> must have applied its mind to the offending causes of the distributorship agreement and come to the conclusion that the trade practices refereed to in those clauses were restrictive trade practices before it made the Order dated th May There is in fact inherent evidence to show that the <ORG> did apply its mind to the clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar because it struck down only a few out of those clauses and did not invalidate the rest It is now settled law that where an authority makes an order in exercise of a quasi judicial function it must record its reasons in support of the order it makes The Order dated th May was therefore clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order made by the <ORG> and did not record any reasons whatsoever in support of is and the appellant was in the circumstances entitled to claim what the Order should be revoked by the <ORG> This view taken by us renders it unnecessary to consider whether there was any material change in the relevant circumstances justifying invocation of the power under section and hence we do not purpose to deal with the same The <ORG> has devoted a part of the order impugned in the present appeal to a consideration of this question and taken the view that there was no material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated th May We do not wish to express any opinion on the correctness of this view taken by the <ORG> since we are setting aside the impugned order made by the <ORG> and also revoking the Order dated th May and sending the matter back so that the application of the Registrar under section a iii may be disposed of afresh We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order of the <ORG> mission rejecting the application of the appellant under section revoke the Order dated th May and remit the case to the <ORG>mission so that the <ORG>mission may dispose of the application of the Registrar under section a iii in the light of the observations contained in this judgment The <ORG>mission will give an opportunity to the appellant to file a proper reply in conformity with the requirements of the Regulations and after taking such relevant evidence as may be produced by both parties proceed to dispose Of the application of the Registrar on merits in accordance with law
