The claimant was taken to <ORG> for medical examination and treatment where it was found that he had sustained as many as external injuries On th December the claimant filed the present claim petition <NAME> appellant in A No of is the owner of the truck with which the accident took place In the written statement filed by him it was pleaded that the claimant had no licence for driving the tempo that he was himself driving the tempo in a negligent manner and the accident took place en that account that the tie rod of the truck suddenly gave way and consequently the accident could not be averted and that the damages claimed were excessive <ORG> Appellant in A No of being the insurer of the truck filed a separate written statement taking up pleas identical to those taken up by <NAME> in his written statement A number of issues were framed by <ORG> and in answer to those issues it was concluded that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of truck No The plea set up by the owner of the truck that the accident took place on account of the tie rod of the truck giving way was rejected Learned counsel for the appellant in A No of filed by the claimant has raised only two points i That since <ORG> did not take into account the prospects of future rise in the income of the claimant and further because <ORG> also did not award interest <ORG> should not have made any deductions on the ground that the claim am shall get the determined amount of compensation in a lump sum ii That in any case <ORG> should have awarded interest to the claimant on the amount of compensation awarded to him In support of his first point learned counsel contended that the claimant was only years of age when the accident took place and his income subsequent to the accident would have increased if he had not been crippled It was urged that the prospect of future rise in income was not taken into account by <ORG> while determining the amount of compensation payable to him and on the contrary it deducted a sum of Rs on the ground that the determined amount of compensation shall be paid to the claimant in lump sum Learned counsel stressed that either <ORG> should have taken into account the prospects of future rise in income and then it could make the deduction for payment in lump sum or it should not have made any deduction for lump sum payment The observations contained in these cases no doubt lend support to the contention that deduction for lump sum payment should not be made if prospect of future rise in income is not taken into account The victim thus had a prosperous business and it was in that background that the court held that since the prospects of the deceased improving his income were not taken into account while assessing the loss nor any interest was awarded no deduction could be made out of the amount of compensation on account of lump sum payment He only knows the job of driver and was middle aged man when the accident took place it is true that even in private service the salaries of employees have an upward tendency per mensem as salary when the accident took place as a loss of earnings suffered by the claimant The amount awarded to the claimant for the loss of earnings therefore would cover such rise of income which the claimant could reasonably expect in future Coming to the second point raised by the learned counsel for the claimant we find some substance in it The legislature has made a special provision for payment of interest in accident claims by enacting Section CC which reads as follows Where any court or <ORG> allows a claim for compensation made under this chapter such court or <ORG> may direct that in additions to the amount of compensation simple interest shall also be paid at such rate and from such date not earlier than the date of making the claim as it may specify in this behalf It has a dual purpose namely i to compensate the claimant for delayed payment of compensation and ii to coerce the person persons who have to pay compensation so that they may not delay the payment It can also not be said that the payment of interest on the amount of compensation shall result in double benefit to the claimant for the claimant can deposit the amount of compensation and earn interest on it only after it has been paid to him A No of has been filed by <ORG> as insurer of the truck with which the accident took place Learned counsel appearing for the appellant in this appeal tried to assail the findings of <ORG> on merits On being pointed out that in view of the provisions contained in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act he could not do so and that the only defences available to an insurance company are those specified in Clauses a to thereof learned counsel urged that the provisions contained in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act only apply to proceedings before a court and not to proceedings before a <ORG> in support of his contention learned counsel referred us to the case of <NAME> Acc CJ AIR Mad We accordingly find that it is not permissible for the appellant in A No of to assail the findings of <ORG> on merits It may however be added that as we shall show while considering the appeal by the truck owner even on merits there is no substance in this appeal Learned counsel representing <ORG> conceded that it is not possible for him to raise in this appeal any contention of the nature referred to in Clauses a to of Sub section of Section of the Motor Vehicles Act This takes us to A No of filed by <NAME> owner of the truck with which the accident took place Learned counsel for the appellant in the first instance contended that on the face of the record it was apparent that the accident took place on account of the negligence of the claimant and not on account of the negligence of the person driving the truck Learned counsel further pointed out that from the statement of the claimant and the photographs of the spot it is apparent that there was a shisham tree in front of the claimant and it should therefore be presumed that on finding the shisham tree in front of him the claimant all of a sudden diverted the tempo on the road and it was for that reason that the accident took place The contention raised on behalf of the appellant that on finding the Shisham tree the claimant all of a sudden diverted the tempo towards the road is a mere surmise having no base whatsoever It is apparent from the photographs on the record that there was a lot of space in between the shisham tree and the pacca road It was also urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that since the claimant continued to drive the vehicle and since the claimant did not blow any horn it should be held that the accident took place on account of his negligence <NAME> was at that time present at his tube well which was only paces away from the place of occurrence while <NAME> was travelling in the same tempo with which the accident had taken place On the evidence of the said witnesses it was amply proved that the truck with which the accident took place was being driven in a rash and negligent manner Some stress was laid by the learned counsel for the appellant on the fact that when the truck was examined by Sant Ram Head Constable he had found that emergency brakes had been applied It was urged by the learned counsel that this should lead to the conclusion that the person driving the truck acted with due care and caution The mere fact that emergency brakes had been applied cannot therefore form basis for the conclusion that the person on the truck was driving it with due care and caution or that the accident took place on account of any negligence on the part of the claimant Without dilating any further on this point we confirm the finding of <ORG> that the accident took place on account of the truck being driven in a rash and negligent manner It was vehemently urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that this was not a case of total disablement and consequently the compensation should not have been determined on the basis of the total remuneration that the claimant was getting at the time of the accident It was therefore obvious that because of the injury sustained by him in the accident he could not follow the normal pursuit of his life We do not think the compensation awarded to the claimant can be reduced on the ground that even if he cannot follow the normal pursuit of life he can do some other petty job to earn his livelihood The contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant does not deserve any serious consideration and is accordingly negatived In this case the victim was a lady and as a result of the injuries sustained by her in the accident she had suffered permanent disability of her left arm to this extent that she could not move it to its full force We thus find nothing in the case referred to by the learned counsel to warrant deduction of the amount of compensation in this case True no compensation in this case was awarded for loss of earning capacity but it was for the reason that it could not be proved by cogent evidence that the earning capacity of the two doctors had actually suffered permanently on account of the injuries sustained by them It should be sufficient to say that each case depends on its own facts It cannot be said that since his other limbs are intact he can still earn something and that he should not have been awarded compensation for loss of his entire income that he would have earned as a driver Learned counsel next urged that besides awarding compensation for loss of income <ORG> also awarded to the claimant a sum of Rupees on account of medical expenditure and a sum of Rs It only states that <ORG> shall after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard hold an enquiry into the claim and may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just The contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant that since the claimant had been awarded compensation for loss of income he should not have been separately awarded compensation for pains and sufferings and agony cannot therefore be accepted and is negatived We have however already said earlier that there is no material whatsoever on the record to warrant a conclusion that the claimant on seeing the shisham tree in front of him all of a sudden diverted the tempo towards the pucca side of the road It was also suggested by the learned counsel for the appellant in her arguments that in any case once the claimant had seen the truck coming in his direction driven at a very fast speed and encroaching on his side of the road he could apply brakes and stop the tempo to avert the accident We have however already said earlier that since the claimant was driving the tempo absolutely on the kachcha part of the road to his left and had also lowered the speed to per hour he had no reason to suspect that the person driving the truck shall come down on that part of the road and dash against the tempo Learned counsel for the appellant then invited our attention to the fact that the right foot of the claimant had to he amputated on account of gangrene All the same the claimant had put the doctor in cross examination and it was open to the appellant to put such further questions to him in cross examination as he liked if he wanted to show that the loss of blood supply or the development of gangrene was not the outcome of the injuries sustained in the accident It was further urged that in any case interest should be awarded to the claimant only on that amount which he would have earned during the period of making of the claim and the date of making the payment of compensation In that background we see no reason why interest should not be awarded to the claimant in this case As for the second part of the contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant it does not find support from the language used in Section CC which has already been quoted earlier The parties shall however bear their own cost in A of
