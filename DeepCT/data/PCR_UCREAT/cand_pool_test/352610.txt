Therefore <ORG> including the second and third respondents ceased to collect Central Sales Tax from April on the above mentioned products or goods manufactured by the petitioners However despite these two letters no action was taken by the respondents as regards the claim refund of the Central and Local Sales Tax collected in excess Again no action was taken by the respondents to dispose of the said applications and hence petitioners addressed on fresh letters reiterating the request for the refund levied and collected in excess of both as regards the Local Sales Tax and the Central Sales Tax No action was however taken by the respondents on the said letters claiming refund of the tax paid in excess till the time of the institution of the present writ petition The assessment orders under challenge are accordingly illegal and liable to be set aside and the petitioners are entitled to the refund of the taxes paid under a mistake of law and collected by the respondents without authority of law Hence two are the questions that fall for our determination namely a whether the products manufactured by the petitioner and listed in the paragraphs and of the petition are drugs and medicines within the purview of the aforesaid Notifications No Fin and No and whether the petitioners are entitled to the refund sought Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has indeed contended before us that the aforesaid products or goods are being manufactured by the petitioners under a licence issued by <ORG> under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act He placed special reliance in what is stated in the said Pharmaceutical Codex as regards Surgical Dressings Adhesive which include Adhesive support and compression bandages as well as Zinc Oxide Elastic Self Adhesive Bandage Zinc Oxide Self Adhesive Tape Plaster of paris Bandage and Belladonna Self Adhesive Plaster In fact in the aforesaid case <ORG> has merely negatived the contentions raised on behalf of the respondents that the refund claimed by the petitioners in that case was not to be granted not only in view of the doctrines of unjust enrichment but also because the provisions of Section of the Excise Act were coming on their way since the claim has been made beyond the period of limitation of months prescribed therein Insofar as the Excise Law is concerned he argued what matters is not the definition given in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act but the commercial and popular understanding of the products as has been held by <ORG> of this Court in Writ Petition No The Division Bench observed that in construing the entries in the Schedule to the Sales Tax Act to determine whether they are taxable or not regard must be had to the items entries as ordinarily understood by the traders and the consumers and in the absence of the technical definition of the entries in the Act itself it is not possible to construe entries by assigning scientific meaning The respondents did not deny these allegations and had resisted the claim for refund merely on three grounds namely a that the petitioners had not exhausted the remedies provided by law that the refund was not to be granted on the application of the principle or doctrine of unjust enrichment and that in view of Section of the Act petitioners were not entitled to any refund as the claim has been made beyond the period of limitation of months provided in the said section <ORG> negatived all these three grounds and therefore granted the relief sought by the petitioners Generally it is so but in a given case the definition given in a particular Statute not being repugnant may be used to construe and interpret the same expression occurring in another statute But the question that falls for our determination is whether in the facts and circumstances of the present case the definition of drug given under Section of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act has any relevance We have already seen that <ORG> had laid down in Gujarat <ORG> case that the well known rule in interpreting fiscal statutes is that resort should be had not to the scientific or technical meaning attached to the goods but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them that is to say to their commercial sense It is thus well settled that generally while interpreting the fiscal statutes the scientific meaning of a product is not relevant but one has to consider its popular understanding or its understanding in the commerce or in the trade But it is obvious that this trade understanding should be the understanding of those who are actually dealing with that particular product or goods The Drugs and Cosmetics Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation which deals with drugs and provides not only for the standards of quality misbranded and adulterated drugs buy also for the safeguards for the manufacture sale and distribution of such drugs as well as of cosmetics Section provides for penalties to the contraventions of the provisions of the Act and specifically lays down that whomsoever himself or by any other person on his behalf manufactures for sale sells stocks or exhibits for sale or distributes inter alia without a valid licence as required under clause of Section shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extent to years and shall also be liable to fine In other words the Drugs and Cosmetics Act makes it abundantly clear that only those drugs which are manufactured under a valid licence issued under the said Act and in compliance with its provisions can be lawfully sold exhibited for sale or distributed This also indicated that trade in respect of drugs is lawfully possible only when there is a compliance with the provisions of the said Act both by the manufacturers and dealers Applying the ratio of this decision to the case at hand it seems to us obvious that the relationship that is established between the manufacturer and the dealer as regards the sale of the products manufactured by the petitioners is of a seller and a buyer and thus the observations of <ORG> in <ORG> case above became most relevant Their Lordships of <ORG> dealing with the provisions of the Central Act regulating the sale and the price of cement vis a vis the clauses of the agreement entered into by the parties indeed observed that the provisions of the Central Act regulating the sale and the price of cement had an overriding effect and thus if the said <ORG> was stipulating that the freight was to be paid by the purchaser such stipulation had to prevail notwithstanding clauses to the contrary in the agreement In the case at hand considering the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act which minutely regulate the manufacture sale and distribution of drugs and cosmetics it appears to us that such provisions necessarily have an overriding effect and therefore prevail and thus the definition of drug given in the said Act is most relevant for determining its meaning in the trade We are thus of the view that Mr <NAME> is entirely right when he contends that the true and real meaning which a drug has in the trade or in commerce is the meaning given to it in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act Then with a view to elaborate the above submission the learned Advocate General took us minutely through the judgment delivered in the said case and contended that though the <ORG> has stated in paragraph that the question which was falling to its determination was whether the said product Handyplast is a drug or medicinal preparation falling under Item of the First Schedule of the Tariff for purposes of duty the fact remains that while addressing to that question the <ORG> made general observations which show that <ORG> held the view that as a general proposition Handyplast is not understood in the trade or in the commerce or popularly as a drug or medicine Though the submission is ingenuous a careful reading of that judgment clearly shows that it has no force The <ORG> therefore addressed itself to that narrow question specifically stating in paragraph that the short question that falls for the determination of the <ORG> is whether the product Handyplast is a drug or a medicinal preparation falling under Item of the First Schedule of the Tariff Then after dealing with some preliminary objections the <ORG> reverted in paragraph to the main question raised in the petition After a detailed discussion <ORG> finally held the view that Handyplast does not constitute a drug or medicinal preparation falling within the purview of Item of the First Schedule which deals with patent or proprietary medicines i drugs or medicinal preparations The above discussion and analysis of the judgment in <NAME> case suffices to clearly show that the submissions of the learned Advocate General above referred to have no merit and what was held in the said case was for the limited purposes of determining whether Handyplast was or not a product falling under Item of the First Schedule of the Tariff for the purposes of duty whether the petitioners are entitled to the refund sought by them and a difference of opinion arose between the learned judges who constituted <ORG> <NAME> found himself bound by the decision given by <ORG> in <ORG> case above after having examined the arguments advanced on behalf of <ORG> and some of the earlier judgments of this Court We reiterate that we are bound by the decisions of <ORG> of this Court in the cases cited above and therefore it is not possible for us to accept the contention of Mr <NAME> as regards the revival of the doctrine of unjust enrichment Therefore in the light of the law laid down in <NAME> case the question arises as to whether petitioners have approached this Court in time We have dealt with the two main question which this petition given rise to He therefore contended that there was no reduction in the rate of duty He submitted that Section A is couched in a language wide enough as to exclude the narrow interpretation given to it by the Advocate General and it indicates was that what really the <ORG> intended was to give a fiscal benefit as regards the actual amount of the tax payable Therefore the interpretation given to the said provision by Mr <NAME> is not acceptable on this court also We are clear that public order publicly made in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant or of what was in his mind or what he intended to do Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself It cannot be that a notification issued under Section of the Customs Act granting modifying or withdrawing an exemption from duty being in the nature of a piece of subordinate legislation its validity cannot be tested by the <ORG> by applying the standards applicable to an administrative action even though it may be that all the grounds that may be urged against an administrative order may not be available against the notification issued under Section of the Act Section of the Central Sales Tax Act postulates in its sub section A that the tax payable under the said Act shall be nil or as the case may be shall be calculated at a lower rate if there is an exemption of the tax or if the product is subject to a tax at a rate lower than We thus find no merit in the above submissions of Mr <NAME> Before we part with this case we may make a reference to the other submissions made by the learned Advocate General The first is that the petitioners had relied in some affidavits in order to prove that the goods in question are commercially understood as being drugs and medicines and that therefore an opportunity should be given to the respondents to cross examine such witnesses We may also make a brief reference to another argument advanced by Mr <NAME> as regard the definition given in Section of the Act As Mr <NAME> submitted placing reliance on the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> and Another the State of Gujarat and Another the word includes should not always be read as meaning an extension and there may be cases where the word connotes the idea of meaning Although we held that the petitioners are entitled to the refund of the excess tax paid are unable to grant the relief of interest as prayed by them The result is that with the modification as regards the interest mentioned in the preceding paragraphs the rule is made absolute in terms of prayers a and
