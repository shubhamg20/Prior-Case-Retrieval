Since the petitioners did not fulfil the condition the sales tax officer forfeited the sum under of On March the petitioners filed a writ petition in <ORG> and contended that was ultra rites the powers of <ORG> and was violative of Arts The single Judge dismissed the petition on the ground that the petitioners defrauded their customers and so were not entitled to any relief even if there was a violation of fundamental rights On December the Collector attached the properties of the petitioners for recovering the amount as arrears of land revenue and the petitioners paid the amount in instalments between August and August inasmuch as the power conferred by the section was unguided uncanalised and uncontrolled and so was not a reasonable restriction on the fundamental right guaranteed under the Article The petitioners contended that they did not know that the section was ultra vires on the particular ground on which this <ORG> struck it down that they paid the amounts under coercion or mistake that the mistake was discovered on September the date of the judgment of this <ORG> and that they were entitled to the refund under of the Indian Contract Act The petition must be dismissed on the ground of Inches Per <NAME> <NAME> Article gives the right to move this <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of fundamental rights and the <ORG> cannot place any hindrance in the way of an aggrieved person This <ORG> has put itself in restraint in the matter of petitions under Art Similarly in inquiring into belated and stale claims this <ORG> should take note of evidence of neglect of the petitioner own rights It is not possible for this <ORG> to lay down any specific period as the ultimate limit of action and each case will have to be considered on its own facts Therefore this <ORG> has to exercise its discretion from case to case and where there is appearance of an avoidable delay and this delay affects the merits of the claim this <ORG> will consider it and in a proper case hold the party disentitled to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction There is thus no question of any mistake of law They should have known the exact ground of unconstitutionality since every one is presumed to know the law and pursued the ground in this <ORG> A Per <NAME> The normal remedy for recovery of money paid to the <ORG> under coercion or mistake of law is by suit The right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed by Art corresponds to a remedy in an ordinary suit and the latter remedy is subject to the bar of a statute of limitation the <ORG> imposes on analogy the same limitation on the summary remedy in the writ jurisdiction even though there is no express statutory bar of limitation on grounds of public policy and on the principle that the laws aid the vigilant and not those who slumber A A In the present case the petitioners were not labouring under any mistake of law when they made the payments because in their writ petition in <ORG> they contended that the order was invalid and that of the Bombay Sales Tax Act was ultra vires and unconstitutional although they did not know the precise ground upon which this <ORG> subsequently struck down A of the ACt Therefore when they made the payments in and they were made under coercion and not under a mistake of law in thinking that the money was due They could rely on the ground of coercion but a suit for the recovery of money on the ground of coercion instituted in February would have been barred by limitation He can file a suit invoke Art also courts have refused to give relief in cases of long or unreasonable delay although the Limitation Act does not apply and the maximum period fixed by the <ORG> for filing a suit is ordinarily taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking the remedy under Art There is no reason for applying a different test when a party comes to this <ORG> under Art They not only opposed the claim of the sales tax authorities but filed a writ petition contending that there was a violation of Art Per <NAME> Article of the Constitution confers a judicial power on this <ORG> and like all judicial powers unless there is an express provision to the contrary it must be exercised in accordance with fundamental principles of administration of justice and one such fundamental principle is that stale claims should not be given effect to If a claim is barred under the Limitation Act prima facie it is a stale claim but even if it is not so barred it may not be entertained by this <ORG> if on the facts of the case there is unreasonable delay To issue a writ direction or order in the nature of mandamus certiorari or prohibition after a delay of years or years would except when there are exceptional circumstances be strange It is difficult to lay down a precise period but a period of one year may be taken as the period beyond which the claim would be a stale claim unless the delay is explained Such a practice would not destroy the guarantee under Art The grounds urged before <ORG> show that it never struck the petitioners that the provision could be challenged on the ground ulti mately accepted by this <ORG> The petitioners discovered like all assessees their mistake when this <ORG> struck down A of the Act and they came to this <ORG> within months of that date and hence there was no delay Hence the petitioners have a fundamental right to approach this <ORG> under Art Since the right given to the petitioners under Art The fact that the petitioners have no equity in their favour is an irrelevant circumstance in deciding the nature of the right available to an aggrieved party under Art This <ORG> is charged by the Constitution with the special responsibility of protecting and enforcing the fundamental rights and hence leaches on the part of an aggrieved party cannot deprive him of his right to get relief under Art In fact law reports do not show a single instance of this <ORG> refusing to grant relief on the ground of delay If this <ORG> could refuse relief on the ground of delay the power of the <ORG> under Art The provisions contained in the Limitation Act do not apply to proceedings under Arts and and if these provisions of the Limitation Act are brought in indirectly to control the remedies conferred by the ConstitUtion it would be a case of <ORG> indirectly abridging the fundamental rights which this <ORG> in <NAME> case held that <ORG> cannot do that forgotten claims and discarded rights against <ORG> may be sought to be enforced after the lapse of a number of years if fundamental rights are held to be enforceable without any time limit is an exaggerated one for after all a petitioner can only enforce an existing right A A In this case the petitioners have an existing right even if their remedy under the ordinary law is barred There is no reason for rejecting the plea of the petitioners that they became aware of the invalidity of the provision only after the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case and since the petition was filed very soon thereafter the petitioners were entitled to relief is dismissed not on the merits but because of the laches on the party applying for the writ or because an alternative remedy was available to him such dismissal is not a bar to a subsequent petition under Art delivered segarate judgments dismissing the petition At the threshold it appears to me that as there is no law which prescribes a period of limitation for such petitions each of my brethren has really given expression to the practice he follows or intends to follow That Article gives the fight to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution Although there is no rule or provision of law to prohibit the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction this <ORG> has always insisted upon recourse to ordinary remedies or the exhaustion of other remedies It follows therefore that this <ORG> puts itself in restraint in the matter of petition under Art In India we have the Limitation Act which prescribes different periods of limitation for suits petitions or applications If then there is no period prescribed what is the standard for this <ORG> to follow I should say that utmost expedition is the sine qua non for such claims In England a period of months has been provided statutorily but that could be because there is no guaranteed remedy and the matter is one entirely of discretion In India I will only say that each case will have to be considered on its own facts Therefore the question is one of discretion for this Court to follow from case to case There is no lower limit and there is no upper limit I agree with the opinion of my brethren <NAME> and <NAME> J<NAME> that there is no question here of a mistake of law entitling the petitioner to invoke analogy of the Article in the Limitation Act The grounds on which he moved the Court might well have impressed this Court which might have also have decided the question of the unconstitutionality of the Act as was done in the subsequent litigation by another party <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the drafts of the judgments prepared by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> I agree with <NAME> <NAME> in his conclusion that the rule laid down in <NAME> State of is inapplicable to the facts of the case but for the reasons I will presently give in my opinion the petition should be allowed Like all judicial powers unless there is an express provision to the contrary it must be exercised in accordance with fundamental principles of administration of justice In Courts of Admiralty where the statutes of limitation do not control proceedings the analogy of such statutes is ordinarily followed unless there is something exceptional in the case Under peculiar circumstances however excusing or justifying the delay courts of equity would not refuse their aid in furtherance of the rights of the party since in such cases there was no presence to insist upon laches or negligence as a ground for dismissal of the suit and in one case carried back the account over a period of fifty years It seems to me however that the above solution is not quite appropriate for petitions under Art If a claim is barred under the Limitation Act unless there are exceptional circumstances prima facie it is a stale claim and should not be entertained by this Court But even if it is not barred under the radian Limitation Act it may not be entertained by this Court if on the facts of the case there is unreasonable delay For instance if the <ORG> had taken possession of property under a law alleged to be void and if a petitioner comes to this Court years after the possession was taken by the <ORG> I would dismiss the petition on the ground of delay unless there is some reasonable explanation There is no need to depart from this practice and tie our hands completely with the shackles imposed by the Indian Limitation Act Again where even if there is no such delay the <ORG> or the statutory authority against whom the consequential relief is prayed for raises a prima facie triable issue as regards the availability of such relief on the merits on grounds like limitation the <ORG> should ordinarily refuse to issue the writ of mandamus for such payment In <ORG> of Kerala <ORG> <NAME> speaking on behalf of a large Bench of this <ORG> observed There is no doubt in view of the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> that money paid under a mistake of law comes within the word mistake in section of the Contract Act and there is no question of estopped when the mistake of law is common to both the parties which was the case here inasmuch as the respondent did not raise the question relating to Article of the Constitution and the <ORG> had no occasion to consider it In such a case where tax is levied by mistake of law it is ordinarily the duty of the <ORG> subject to any provision in the law relating to sales tax and no such provision has been brought to our notice to refund the tax Coming to the facts of this case which have been stated in detail by <NAME> it seems to me that the delay in coming to this Court has been adequately explained The petitioner promptly filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging this order On February four petitioners hereinafter compendiously referred to as the petitioner filed this petition praying that the order dated March and the notice and order dated December and December be quashed There is no doubt that under of the Contract Act the petitioner would be entitled to the relief claimed and the refund of the amount if he paid the money under mistake of law Assuming that the respondent had power to forreit the sum under the Act of it was strictly limited to taxes payable trader the provisions of the Act and as no tax was payable on outside sale the authorities had no power to forfeit the sum of Rs Even assuming while denying that the respondent had power to forfeit the sum of Rs the power to forfeit an amount as a tax presupposes a power to impose a tax and inasmuch as on a proper construction of the relevant provisions of the Constitution <ORG> had at any time a power to impose tax on the aforesaid transactions the power to forfeit tax in respect of those transactions is ultra vires <ORG> The petitioner rightly did not file an appeal to this Court for he would have had little chance of succeeding Suppose a petitioner challenges a provision of the Sales Tax Act before <ORG> on the ground that it does not fall within List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule a point which he and his lawyers never thought of All assessees who had paid tax without challenging the provision would be entitled to approach this <ORG> under Art The grounds extracted above show that it never struck the petitioner that the provision could be challenged on the ground ultimately accepted by this <ORG> The contention seems to be that when a petitioner approaches <ORG> and fails he can no longer suffer from any mistake of law even if the point on which this <ORG> ultimately strikes down the provision never struck him or his lawyer or the <ORG> He has come to this <ORG> within six months of that day and there is no delay <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by <NAME> For the reasons given in this judgment On March the petitioners filed a writ petition in <ORG> seeking to restrain the Sales Tax Officer from recovering the amount The petitioners filed an appeal against the order The arguments in the present appeal proceeded on the assumption that of the Bombay Sales Tax Act is liable to be struck down on the same ground On February the petitioners filed the present writ petition under Art They alleged that they paid this sum to the Collector under coercion and or mistake of law and that they discovered the mistake on September Two points arise for decision in this writ petition Would the claim be barred by limitation if it were the subject matter of a suit in February and if so are the petitioners entitled to any relief in this petition under Art In my opinion the petitioners were not labouring under any mistake of law when they made the payments After the writ petition was dismissed their properties were attached and they made the payments under coercion in and They cannot claim any relief on the ground of mistake As we are assuming in favour of the petitioners that of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as invalid we must hold that they made the payments under coercion Accordingly a suit for the recovery of money instituted in February would be barred by limitation of fife Indian Limitation Act and time would begin to run from the date when the mistake becomes known to the plaintiff In some American States it has been held that a mistake of law cannot be regarded as a mistake within a similar statute and time ran from the date of the accrual of the cause of action see Corpus Juris Secundum vol Accordingly I express no opinion on the scope of of the Limitation Act For the reasons already stated a suit for the recovery of the money instituted in February would be barred by limitation The right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed by Art Thus a petitioner has no right to move this <ORG> under Art for enforcement of his fundamental right on a petition containing misleading and inaccurate statements and if he files such a petition the <ORG> will dismiss it see No of <ORG> <ORG> decided on March Similarly this <ORG> has summarily dismissed innumerable writ petitions on the ground that it was presented after unreasonable delay The normal remedy for recovery of money paid to the <ORG> under coercion or mistake of law is by suit If the right to a property is extinguished by prescription under of the Limitation Act the petitioner has no subsisting right which can be enforced under Art The first petitioner before us is a registered partnership firm hereinafter referred to as the firm carrying on business in Bombay and the other petitioners are partners of the said firm The firm has been carrying on business as a dealer in and a trader of textiles and art silk etc were not liable to be taxed under the provisions of the Bombay Sales Tax Act then in force as the goods were delivered as a direct result of such sales for purposes of consumption outside the State of Bombay It appears that the petitioner did not fulfil this condition and a notice dated th January was issued calling upon the firm to show cause why the said sum of Rs Further the firm case in that letter was that the authorities had no right to forfeit any amount collected by a dealer under a mistake of law in respect of these transactions and the threat to forfeit the amount on the ground that it had not been refunded to the firm customers was without the authority of law of the Constitution for the issue of a writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the above mentioned order of forfeiture and for incidental reliefs The main judgment was delivered in <NAME> and Company case The learned Judge observed in the course of his judgment that there was no merit whatsoever in it and justice did not lie in his the petitioner side and this was a matter in which the court should not interfere by way of a writ and give relief to the petitioner company Dealing with the petition of the firm the learned Judge said that there was no merit in the case and justice did not lie on the side of the petitioner and for reasons given in <NAME> case the petition was dismissed They were inter alia The learned Judge erred in not deciding the petition on merits even when there was a question of violation of fundamental rights We may observe that we are not dealing with this case on the merits at all We have not considered the question whether the appellant is entitled in law to retain the moneys which he has obtained from the sales tax department The petitioners submit that they have been deprived of their property to wit the said sum by the respondents without any authority in law and contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners by Arts inasmuch as it did not lay down any procedure for ascertaining whether in fact the dealer concerned had collected any amount by way of tax from his purchasers outside the <ORG> and if so what that amount was It was further observed that the section did not contemplate any adjudication nor did it provide for making any order and on a reasonable interpretation of the impugned provision The levy of sales tax on forward transactions being held to be ultra vires by <ORG> by its judgment delivered on February in the case of <NAME> Kanpur the respondent by its letter dated th July asked for a refund of the amount of sales tax paid by it under assessment orders passed on May October and August The state of mind of the respondent would be the only thing relevant to consider in this context and once the respondent established that the payments were made by it under a mistake of law it was entitled to recover back the said amounts a and on that view observed that the payment was made under a mistake within of the Indian Contract Act and so the Government to whom the payment had been made must repay it This Court although of opinion that <ORG> had power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to give consequential relief by ordering repayment of money realised by the Government without the authority of law observed At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact that the special remedy provided in Art It has been made clear more than once that the power to give relief under Art This is specially true in the case of power to issue writs in the nature of mandamus Among the several matters which the <ORG> rightly take into consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the delay made by the aggrieved party in seeking this special remedy and what excuse there is for it Thus where as in these cases a person comes to the <ORG> for relief under Art on the allegation that he has been assessed to tax under a void legislation and having paid it under a mistake is entitled to get it back the court if it finds that the assessment was void being made under a void provision of law and the payment was made by mistake is still not bound to exercise its discretion directing repayment Whether repayment should be ordered in the exercise of this discretion will depend in each case on its own facts and circumstances It may however be stated as a general rule that if there has been unreasonable delay the court ought not ordinarily to lend its aid to a party by this extraordinary remedy of mandamus Again where even if there is no such delay the <ORG> or the statutory authority against whom the consequential relief is prayed for raises a prima facie triable issue as regards the availability of such relief on the merits on grounds like limitation the <ORG> should ordinarily refuse to issue the writ of mandamus for such payment In <ORG> <ORG> the respondents after submitting returns under the Sales Tax Act for the period May to March showing a net turnover exceeding Rs Further they had the benefit of the judgment of the appeal Bench of <ORG> that the case was not being decided on the merits at all and even if there was any violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioners the exercise of discretion by the learned single Judge would not be interfered with in appeal It was therefore clear to the petitioners that there was no adjudication as to their fundamental rights or the merits of their claim and there was nothing to prevent the petitioners then from coming up to this Court by preferring an appeal from the judgment of <ORG> or by instituting a suit for declaration of the order of forfeiture illegal and ultra vires and for an injunction restraining the State from giving effect thereto It is therefore not possible to hold that the payments complained of following the order of forfeiture were made in mistake of law They were payments under compulsion or coercion A payment under coercion has to be treated in the same way for the purposes of a claim to refund as a payment under mistake of law but there is an important distinction between the two He can either make an application under Art of the Constitution to <ORG> or he can make an application to this <ORG> under Art of the Constitution or he can file a suit asking for appropriate reliefs the courts have a discretion and may in suitable cases refuse to give relief to the person approaching it even though on the merits the applicant has a substantial complaint as regards violation of fundamental rights Although the Limitation Act does not apply the courts have refused to give relief in cases of long or unreasonable delay As noted above in <NAME> case it was observed that the maximum period fixed by the legislature as the time within Which the relief by a suit in a civil court must be brought may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Art On the question of delay we see no reason to hold that a different test ought to be applied when a party comes to this <ORG> under Art of the Limitation Act of fixed a period of one year for a suit against <ORG> to recover money paid under protest in satisfaction of a claim made by the revenue authorities on account of arrears of revenue or on account of demands recoverable as such arrears from the date when the payment was made As an attachment was levied under of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act Ii of it is a moot question as to whether the payments made in and in this case would not attract the said article of the Limitation Act of It was held by this Court in <NAME> The State that the period of limitation for a suit to recover taxes illegally collected was governed by Article of the Limitation Act of providing a space of three years from the date of payment The period of six years would have expired some time in but the Limitation Act of was repealed by the Limitation Act of and by a of the Act of it was provided that Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act a any suit for which the period of limitation is shorter than the period of limitation prescribed by the Indian Limitation Act may be instituted within a period of five years next after the commencement of this Act or within the period prescribed for such suit by the Indian Limitation Act whichever period expires earlier A claim for money paid under coercion would be covered by Art of the Limitation Act giving a period of three years from the first of January on which date the Act came into force I may also note in brief another contention urged on behalf of the respondents that the present petition is barred by principles analogous to res judicata It was contended by learned counsel for the respondents that the decisions of <ORG> were speaking orders and even if the petition to <ORG> had been dismissed in limine there would be a decision on the merits is dismissed not on the merits but because of laches on the party applying for the writ or because an alternative remedy is available to him such dismissal is no bar to the subsequent petition under Art If by a final decision of a competent <ORG> his title to property has been negatived he ceases to have the fundamental right in respect of that property and therefore he can no longer enforce it But where there is no such decision at all there is no scope to call in its aid I cannot however find no merit in the contention that because there is an invasion of a fundamental right of a citizen he can be allowed to come to this Court no matter how long after the infraction of his right he applies for relief <NAME> I had the advantage of studying the judgments just delivered by my brothers <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> The facts of the case are fully set out in those judgments I shall not restate them If a competent court holds that he has no such right that decision is binding on him of the Constitution on the grounds that that section did not lay down any procedure for ascertaining whether in fact the dealer concerned had collected any amount by way of tax from its purchasers outside the State and if so what that amount was neither the section nor any rule framed under the Act contemplated any enquiry much less a reasonable enquiry in which the dealer complained of could plead and prove his case or satisfy the authorities that their assumptions were wholly or partly wrong and further the section also did not provide for any enquiry on disputed questions of fact or law or for making an order it follows that the impugned collection was without the authority of law and consequently the same is an exaction resulting in the infringement of one of the proprietary rights of the petitioners guaranteed to them under Art Hence the petitioners have a fundamental right to approach this <ORG> under Art a <NAME> speaking for the majority observed that once it is proved to the satisfaction of this <ORG> that by State action the fundamental right of a petitioner has been infringed it is not only the right but the duty of this <ORG> under Art The right given to the citizens to move this <ORG> under Art It must be remembered as emphasized by several decisions of this <ORG> that this <ORG> is charged by the Constitution with the special responsibility of protecting and enforcing the fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution It always took care to see that a bad case did not end in laying down a bad law In that respect our Constitution makes a Welcome departure from many other similar Constitutions The power conferred on this <ORG> by that Article is not a discretionary power of the Constitution Hence laches on the part of an aggrieved party cannot deprive him of the right to get relief from this <ORG> under Art Law reports do not show a single instance where this <ORG> had refused to grant relief to a petitioner in a petition under Art I am mentioning all these aspects to show how jealously this <ORG> has been resisting every attempt to narrow down the scope of the rights guaranteed under Part of our Constitution Admittedly the provisions contained in the Limitation Act do not apply to proceedings under Art that the <ORG> cannot by amending the Constitution abridge the fundamental rights conferred under Part III of the Constitution The fear that forgotten claims and discarded rights may be sought to be enforced against the Government after lapse of years if the fundamental rights are held to be enforceable without any time limit appears to be an exaggerated one It is for the party who complains the infringement of any right to establish his right If a right is lost for one reason or the other there is no right to be enforced Let us take for example a Case of a person who is convicted and sentenced to a long period of imprisonment on the basis of a statute which had been repealed long before the alleged offence was committed he will have no right the discretion of the <ORG> apart to move this <ORG> for a writ of habeas corpus Our Constitution makers in their wisdom thought that no fetters should be placed on the right of an aggrieved party to seek relief from this <ORG> under Art The decision of this <ORG> referred to in the judgment of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> who spoke for the <ORG> specifically referred to this aspect when he says that it has been made clear more than once that power to relief under Art <ORG> did not decide the merits of the case in the writ petition filed by the petitioners The grounds on which the petitioners challenged the validity of A of the Bombay Sales Tax Act before <ORG> have now been found to be unsustainable by <ORG> in <NAME> and Bros A law passed by a competent legislature is bound to be presumed to be valid until it is struck down by a competent court Hence this case under any circumstance falls within the rule laid down by this Court in <NAME> case
