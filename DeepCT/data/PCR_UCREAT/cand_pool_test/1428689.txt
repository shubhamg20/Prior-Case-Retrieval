There is no absolute rule of law not even a rule of pru dence that has ripened into a rule of law that a dying declaration in order that it may sustain an order of convic tion must be corroborated by other independent evidence Consequently in a case where the trial judge as also the <ORG> founded their orders of conviction of an accused person under Of the Indian Penal Code mainly on three dying declarations made by the murdered person in quick succession one after the other and the <ORG> relying on a decision of this <ORG> sought for corroboration of such dying declarations in the fact that the accused person had absconded and was arrested in suspicious circumstances but was in doubt as to the sufficiency of such evidence of corroboration and granted the certificate of fitness under Art I I Held that the certificate granted by the <ORG> was incompetent and as the case disclosed no grounds on which this <ORG> could possibly grant special leave to appeal under Art The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal on a certificate of fitness under Art granted by <ORG> at Nagpur as it then was is directed against the concurrent judgment and orders of the courts below so far as the appellant <NAME> is concerned convicting and sentencing him to death under Indian Penal Code for the pre meditated murder of <NAME> on the night of February in one of the quarters of the city of Nagpur There was another report lodged by <NAME> one of the four persons placed on trial along with the appellant for the murder of <NAME> He found <NAME> in a serious condition and suspecting that he might not survive and apprebending that it might take time for the magistrate to be informed and to be at the spot to record the dying declaration he consult ed Dr <NAME> the attending doctor whether <NAME> was in a fit condition to make a statement Hence he actually recorded <NAME> statement in answer to the questions put by him Ex We shall have to advert later to the recorded dying declara tions in some detail in the course of this judgment After investigation and the necessary inquiry four persons were placed on trial and the appellant was one of them He sentenced the appel lant to death because in his opinion he had caused <NAME> death intentionally and there were no extenuat ing circumstances The reference the appeal by the convicted accused persons as also the appeal by <ORG> against the two accused per sons who had been acquitted by the learned trial Judge and the revisional application for enhancement of sentence passed upon <NAME> also filed by the State Government were all heard together and disposed of by one judgment by a Bench consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> <ORG> apparently with a view to understanding the evidence adduced in the case on behalf of the parties made a local inspection on September and recorded their impressions in a note which forms part of the record of <ORG> The doubt was further accentuated by the fact that there were three or four persons of the name of <NAME> residing in the neigh bourhood and some of them are Telis The main ground for the grant of the certificate may be reproduced in the words of <ORG> itself The main ground is that there is not enough evidence against the accused and that there is an error in our judg ment in holding that there was no evidence to show that <NAME> whose absconding has been held to corroborate the dying declaration was involved in a liquor case In view of the fact that there is this error and the sufficien cy of the evidence might be a matter for consideration in the light of this additional evidence we think this is a fit case for a special certificate under art of the Constitution not on any difficult question of law or procedure which it thought required to be settled by this <ORG> but on a question which is essentially one of fact namely whether there was sufficient evidence of the guilt of the accused Under the Con stitution it has the power and it is its duty to hear appeals as a Regular <ORG> of Appeal on facts involved in cases coming up to this <ORG> on a certificate under Art The appeal on such a certificate has therefore to be dismissed in limine but we have to satisfy ourselves whether there are such grounds as would justify this <ORG> in granting special leave to appeal to this <ORG> if the appellant had approached this <ORG> in that behalf It appears from the judgments of the courts below that the prosecution case rests mainly upon the three dying declarations of <NAME> who died shortly after making those statements as to his assailants in quick succession within about two and a half hours of the I But the decision of this Court in <NAME> State of Madhya Pra desh was brought to their notice and in view of that decision <ORG> looked for corroboration of the dying declarations aforesaid The records in connection with that case have been placed before us and after examining those records we do not find any good reasons for differing from <ORG> in its appreciation of the circumstances connected with the absconding of the accused It is in this light that the different dying declarations made by the deceased and sought to be proved in the case have to be considered We have therefore to examine the legal position whether it is settled law that a dying declaration by itself can in no circumstances be the basis of a conviction This <ORG> examined the evidence in detail with a view to satisfying itself that the dying declarations relied upon in that case were true In that case apart from the dying declarations there was the evidence of the approver Thus after a very careful and cautious examination of the facts of the case connected with the recording of the dying declaration and of the other evidence in the case and of the fact that it was a dark night without any lights available at the place of occurrence this <ORG> distinctly came to the conclusion that the dying declaration was not true and could not be relied upon to base upon that alone the conviction of the appellants The <ORG> in its wisdom has enacted in of the Evidence Act that When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death in cases in which the cause of that person death comes into question such a statement written or verbal made by a person who is dead omitting the unnecessary words is itself a relevant fact The purpose of cross examination is to test the veracity of the statements made by a witness In the view of the <ORG> that test is supplied by the solemn occasion when it was made namely at a time when the person making the statement was in danger of losing his life Thus a statement made by a dying person as to the cause of death has been accorded by the <ORG> a special sanctity which should on first principles be respected unless there are clear circum stances brought out in the evidence to show that the person making the statement was not in expectation of death not that that circumstance would affect the admissibility of the statement but only its weight It may also be shown by evidence that a dying declaration is not reliable because it was not made at the earliest opportunity and thus there was a reasonable ground to believe its having been put into the mouth of the dying man when his power of resistance against telling a falsehood was ebbing away or because the statement has not been properly recorded for example the statement bad been recorded as a result of prompting by some interested parties or was in answer to leading questions put by the recording officer or by the person purporting to reproduce that statement But in our opinion there is no absolute rule of law or even a rule of prudence which has ripened into a rule of law that a dying declaration unless corrobo rated by other independent evidence is Dot fit to be acted upon and made the basis of a conviction On the other hand the different <ORG> in India including Burma have taken conflicting views as to the value of a dying declaration in part or in its entirety without any independent corroboration The <ORG> set aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial judge and recorded an order of conviction for murder practically on the dying declaration of the victim of the crime The learned Judges of <ORG> further observed that in order to found on a dying declaration alone a judgment of conviction of an accused person the <ORG> must be fully satisfied that the dying declaration has the impress of truth on it after examining all the circumstances in which the dying person made his statement ex parte and without the accused having the opportunity of cross examining him In <ORG> there was a difference of judicial opinion as expressed in certain unreported cases which resulted in a reference to a Full Bench His conclusions are expressed in the penultimate paragraph of his judgment thus In my judgment it is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rule when a dying declaration should be accepted beyond saying that each case must be decided in the light of the other facts and the surrounding circumstances but if the <ORG> after taking everything into consideration is convinced that the statement is true it is its duty to convict notwithstanding that there is no corroboration in the true sense The <ORG> must of course be fully con vinced of the truth of the statement and naturally it could not be fully convinced if there were anything in the other evidence or in the surrounding circumstances to raise suspicion as to its credibility On a review of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and of the decided cases in the different <ORG> in India and in this <ORG> we have come to the conclusion in agreement with the opinion of <ORG> of <ORG> aforesaid that it cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated that each case must be determined on its own facts keeping in view the circumstances in which the dying decla ration was made that it cannot be laid down as a general proposition that a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than other pieces of evidence that a dying declaration stands on the same footing as another piece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with reference to the princi ples governing the weighing of evidence that a dying declaration which has been recorded by a competent magis trate in the proper manner that is to say in the form of questions and answers and as far as practicable in the words of the maker of the declaration stands on a much higher footing than a dying declaration which depends upon oral testimony which may suffer from all the infirmities of human memory and human character and that in order to test the reliability of a dying declaration the <ORG> has to keep in view the circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation for example whether there was sufficient light if the crime was committed at night whether the capacity of the man to remember the facts stated had not been impaired at the time he was making the state ment by circumstances beyond his control that the state ment has been consistent throughout if he had several oppor tunities of making a dying declaration apart from the offi cial record of it and that the statement had been made at the earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties Hence in order to pass the test of reliability a dying declaration has to be subjected to a very close scrutiny keeping in view the fact that the statement has been made in the absence of the accused who had no opportunity of testing the veracity of the statement by cross examination But once the court has come to the conclusion that the dying declaration was the truthful version as to the circumstances of the death and the assailants of the victim there is no question of further corroboration If on the other hand the court after examining the dying declaration in all its aspects and testing its veracity has come to the conclusion that it is not reliable by itself and that it suffers from an infirmity then without corroboration it cannot form the basis of a conviction Thus the necessity for corrobora tion arises not from any inherent weakness of a dying decla ration as a piece of evidence as held in some of the re ported cases but from the fact that the court in a given case has come to the conclusion that that particular dying declaration was not free from the infirmities referred to above or from such other infirmities as may be disclosed in evidence in that case Having made the general observations bearing on the question of the legality of basing a conviction on a dying declara tion alone and keeping in view the tests set out above let us examine the dying declarations now in question before us The most remarkable fact which emerges from an examination of the three successive dying declarations made in the course of about two hours by the deceased is that he con sistently named the appellant and <NAME> as the persons who had assaulted him with sword and spear Of the two assailants named by him <NAME> was convicted by the learned trial judge but acquitted by <ORG> which very reluctantly gave him the bene fit of the doubt created by the similarity of names in that locality as already stated There was no such confusion in the case of the appellant The deceased indicated that there were two more persons concerned in the crime but he could not name them There is no doubt therefore that <NAME> had been consistent through out in naming the appellant as one of his assailants and he named him within less than half an hour of the occurrence and as soon as he reached <ORG> There was thus no opportunity or time to tutor the dying man to tell a lie Hence we have no reasons to doubt the truth of the dying declarations and their reliability We have also no doubt that from the legal and from the practical points of view the dying declarations of the deceased <NAME> are sufficient to sustain the appellant conviction for murder The only other question that remains to be considered is whether there are any extenuating circumstances in favour of the accused justify ing the lesser of the two sentences prescribed by law In our opinion there are none For the reasons given above we uphold the judgment and order of <ORG> convicting the appellant of murder and sentencing him to death
