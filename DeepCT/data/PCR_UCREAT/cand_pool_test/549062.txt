affected order need not give reasons but must be indicate satisfaction forming basis for action and concise statement of allegations Action under Clause of drastic nature Must be animated by sense of urgency Sense of urgency infused by several factors Public sentiment is one such factor Public interest to be paramount consideration It is for authorities to consider public interest <ORG>s not to concern themselves with sufficiency of ground <ORG>s to consider question of mala fide or patent lack of jurisdiction Interpretation of statutes Rules of <ORG>s not permitted to interpret statutory instruments so as to exclude natural justice unless language of instrument leaves no option to <ORG> Natural justice Rules of Extent of natural justice Must vary from case to case Interim orders imply natural justice Seeking comments of person before investigation against him not necessary Decision affecting a person must be communicated to the affected person Affected person must be given post decisional opportunity not possible Though the circulars did not themselves cite any statutory authority they were as claimed and as agreed to by the parties presumed to be statutory orders made in exercise of the power conferred by cl of the Import Control Order <ORG> was one of those who filed such a writ petition in the Bombay High <ORG> <ORG> contended that the requisite satisfaction of the appropriate authority which was necessary for issuing an order under cl was not only not recorded in the circular but there was no material whatsoever upon which such satisfaction could have been arrived at that the circular was not confined to the banned item of animal tallow or to items which could be said to have some connection with the banned item but extended to all item for which applications for the grant of licences or for allotment had been made by <ORG> that general nature of the order disclosed a total non application of the mind that several firms were clubbed together and dealt with by a single circular and there was no indication whatsoever that the facts relating to each of the firms had been considered separately that the <ORG> circulars far from advancing the public interest would on the other hand prejudicially affect the public interest by bringing to a halt several industries and throwing hosts of workers out of employment that there was no substance in the allegation that <ORG> were not actual users of beef tallow but they had misused the import licences of other licensees by obtaining letters of authorisation for import of beef tallow as if they were actual users and that the circumstance that there was public agitation about the import of beef tallow was a total irrelevant circumstance for making an order under cl The interveners contended that cl should be construed as providing for an opportunity to be heard and since the <ORG> orders made no provision for hearing they should be struck down as opposed to the principles of natural justice and therefore arbitrary and violative of Article and of the Constitution that secret orders affecting rights of parties could not lawfully be made since secrecy would militrate against natural justice and against the right of appeal provided by of the Imports and Exports Control Act and that an order under cl could only be made after the investigation under cl had commenced that is after a show cause notice had been issued under cl Dismissing the writ petitions HELD It is not permissible to interpret any statutory instrument so as to exclude natural justice unless the language of the instrument leaves no option to the <ORG> It may not oven be necessary in some situations to give pre decisional opportunity of making a representation but it would be sufficient but obligatory to consider any representation that may be made by the aggrieved person and that would satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness and natural justice Ad interim orders may always be made ex parte and such orders may themselves provide for an opportunity to the aggrieved party to be heard at a later stage Even if the interim orders do not make provision for such an opportunity an aggrieved party has nevertheless always the right to make an appropriate representation seeking a review of the order and asking the authority to rescind or modify the order There is no violation of a principle of natural justice if an ex parte ad interim order is made unless of course the statute itself provides for a hearing before the order is made Natural justice will be violated if the authority refuses to consider the request of the aggrieved party for an opportunity to make his representation against the ex parte ad interim orders A There is no rule of justice of fair play which requires the authority to seek the comments of the person concerned before embarking upon an investigation Investigation commences as soon as the authority concerned to take the first step whether by way of seeking evidence or by way of seeking an explanation from the person concerned An interim order of stay or suspension which has the effect of preventing a person however temporarily say from pursuing his profession or line of business may have substantial serious and even disastrous consequences to him and may expose him to grave risk and hazard Clause empowers <ORG> or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to keep in <ORG> applications for licences or allotment of imported goods where any investigation is pending into any of the allegations mentioned in cl against a licences importer or any other person subject to fulfilment of the requirement of the satisfaction of the appropriate authority regarding the public interest The requirements of natural justice will be met in the case of action under cl by considering bona fide any representation that may be made in that behalf by the person aggrieved There is nothing in cl to suggest that the decision is not to be communicated The expression without assigning reasons only means that there is no obligation to formulate reasons and nothing more So the authority may not give formal reasons but the skeletal allegations must be mentioned in order to provide an opportunity to the person affected to make his representation If the threatened public mischief is such as to outweigh the likely injury to the party the authority may take action under cl Which element of the public interest should be given greater weight and which grounds should weigh at all are matters for the authority taking action under cl The <ORG> cannot consider the question whether there is sufficient relevant material in support of the allegations made against the petitioners A The submission that since the <ORG> order was never formally communicated to the petitioners it must be treated as non est has no substance The argument that cl excludes the application of cl to goods covered by Open General Licence has no substance In view of this non obstante clause there is no doubt that cl applies There was ex facie nothing in the circular which could point to the authority having applied its mind and considered the case of his concerned separately But the <ORG> attention was invited to the statements made in the counter affidavit by the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Export the author of the <ORG> circular and the relevant files placed before the <ORG> for perusal which shows that the principal allegations against the petitioners were that they had prima facie indulged in illegal importation of beef tallow and had also misutilised the beef tallow Why the authority took this prima facie view has been explained in the counter affidavit Thus it does not make any difference on the peculiar facts of this case that a single circular was issued covering a large number of concerns In the instant case the real remedy of the party to make a representation to the concerned authority which is directed to consider such representation if made There was a furore in the country There were demands that severe action be taken against those responsible Why the secrecy and why the instruction to mislead as it were Are statutory orders to be made and given effect in this furtive manner almost as if the authorities that be are afraid of wounding the susceptibilities of the persons in respect of whom the orders are made We presume they are statutory orders made in exercise of the powers conferred by clause of the Import Control Order though they do not themselves cite any statutory authority In the counter affidavits filed on behalf of <ORG> and the Chief and Deputy Chief Controller of <ORG> it is claimed that the power exercised was that conferred by clause So we may also proceed on that basis <ORG> was one of those who filed such a Writ Petition in <ORG> There was never any allegation against the petitioners that any portion of the tallow imported by them had ever been diverted for the adulteration of vanaspati <ORG> therefore claim that there was no justification what for making an order under clause against them In the present case not only was the requisite satisfaction of the appropriate authority not recorded in the circular said to have been issued under Clause but there was no material whatsoever upon which such satisfaction could have been arrived it Restrictions placed on the import of goods in the policy for the subsequent years have to be ignored unless of course any such restriction has been specifically made applicable to licences issued earlier either generally or in the particular cases In the public notice there is no specific provision invalidating licences previously issued as far as beef tallow is concerned in case such licences were valid earlier to import this item It was further contended that the circular order under Clause as actually issued was not confined to the banned item of animal tallow or to items which could be said to have some connection with the banned item but extended to all items for which applications for the grant of licences or for allotment had been made by <ORG> whether or not such items had the remotest connection with animal tallow Shri <NAME> connected that the very general nature of the order disclosed a total non application of the mind since there was no nexus between the alleged misuse of licence for importing beef tallow or the misuse of the imported beef tallow and the abeyance of applications for grant of import licences and for allotment of other items It was also argued that as many as firms were clubbed together and dealt with by single circular and there was no indication whatsoever that the facts relating to each of the firms had been considered separately It was submitted that there was no substance in they allegation that <ORG> were not actual users of beef tallow but they had none the less obtained letters of authorisation for import of beef tallow as if they were actual users and they had thus misused the import licences of other licencees <NAME> learned counsel for one of the interveners suggested that clause did not apply to goods covered by open General Licence in view of clause of the Import Control Order which provided Nothing in this order except paragraph of sub clause of Clause Clause Clause A Clause and Clause shall apply to the import of any goods covered by open General Licence or Special General Licence issued by the Central Government <NAME> who appeared for another intervener submitted that clause should be construed as providing for an opportunity to be heard and since the abeyance orders made no provision for hearing they should be struck down as opposed to the principles of natural justice and therefore arbitrary and violative of Art It was also urged by the learned counsel that the satisfaction contemplated by clause was not an omnibus satisfaction but a satisfaction which must disclose an application of the mind to the facts of each individual case and each individual application for licence or allotment <NAME> who appeared for another intervener urged that secret orders affecting rights of parties could not lawfully be made since secrecy would militate against natural justice and against the right of appeal provided by sec There was no such public interest involved in the case There was not even a recital to that effect <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General urged that the only question for the consideration of the court was whether there was any relevant material before the authority competent to take action under clause to reach the satisfaction contemplated by that clause He however invited our attention to various facts and circumstances which according to him wholly justified the action taken against <ORG> Though <ORG> itself held several licences it nevertheless indulged in the collection of a large number of licences of other imported beef tallow as their authorised agents sold part of the beef tallow to alleged actual users on high seas or purchased the beef tallow after importation subjected it to the so called air treatment a treatment which could by no means be called a manufacturing process and which left the character of beef tallow unaltered and sold it to innumerable parties stated to be soap manufacturers and fatty acid plants There was great public concern about the manner in which beef tallow had been imported and used by some importers and the authorities very naturally felt that it was their duty in the public interest to investigate into malpractices connected with the import of beef tallow and the misuse of beef tallow after import He submitted that rule did not rule out a post decisional hearing and stated that the appropriate authorities were ready even now to consider faithfully any representation made by the parties affected With reference to the views expressed by <ORG> and <ORG> in the cases of <ORG> and <ORG> <NAME> submitted that those cases did not represent the correct position in law Paragraph provides that REP licences and additional licences held by Export Houses shall cease to be valid for import of any item which could be imported under Open General Licences during but it is no longer so in the Import Policy except for such commitments as have been made by opening irrevocable letters of credit through authorised dealers in foreign exchange before April The question posed is whether the ban of import except through <ORG> was applicable to beef tallow imported into India after June but against licences issued earlier and in respect of which contacts had already been into We have already mentioned that on August <ORG> made an order under Section of the Exports and Imports Control Act totally banning the import into India of beef buffalo and pig tallow Section of the Imports and Exports Control Act defines various expressions Letter of authority is defined a letter meaning as authorising the licensee to permit another person named in the said letter to import goods against the licence granted to the licensee Licence is defined to mean a licence granted and including a customs clearance permit issued under any control order Section provides for adjudications and Section entitles the owner of the goods materials conveyance or animals or other persons concerned to be given a reasonable opportunity of making a representation before any order of adjudication of confiscation or imposition of a penalty is made Section provides for an appeal against any decision or order made under the Act and Section empowers the Chief Controller to exercise power of revision in cases where no appeal has been preferred Section makes contraventions of any order made or deemed to be made under the Act or any condition of a licence granted under such order punishable with imprisonment and fine as mentioned in that provision Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act The Imports Control Order is an order made by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by Section and A of the Imports and Exports Control Act Clause of the Imports Control Order prescribes that no person shall import any goods of the description specified in Schedule I except under and in accordance with the licence or a customs clearance permit granted by <ORG> or by a specified officer Clause empowers <ORG> or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to debar a licencee or importer or any other person from importing any goods or receiving licences or allotment of the imported goods through <ORG> <ORG> or any other similar agencies and direct without prejudice to any other action that may be taken against him in this behalf and that no licence or allotment of imported goods shall be granted to him and he shall not be permitted to import any goods for a specified period for any of the reasons specified in the clause Two of the reasons mentioned in the clause are If he fails to comply with or contravenes or attempts to contravene or abets the contravention of any conditions embodied in or accompanying a licence or an application for a licence and If he commits a breach of any law including any rule order or regulation relating to custom or the import or export of goods or foreign exchange The first proviso to Clause A prescribes that the grant of a licence or allotment of imported goods shall not ordinarily be suspended under this clause for a period exceeding months The second proviso stipulates that on the withdrawal of such suspension a licence or allotment of imported goods may be granted to him for a period of suspension subject to such conditions restrictions or limitations as may be decided by the authorities aforesaid keeping in view of the foreign exchange position indigenous production and other relevant factors Clause empowers <ORG> or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to keep in abeyance applications for licences or allotment of imported goods where any investigation is pending into any of the allegations mentioned in Clause against a lincensee importer or any other person subject to the fulfilment of the requirement of the satisfaction of the appropriate authority regarding the public interest Since we are primarily concerned in this case with the vires the width and the interpretation of Clause the whole of it may be usefully extracted Power to keep in abeyance applications for licences or allotments of imported goods Where any investigation into any of the allegations mentioned in clause is pending against a licensee or importer or any other person and the Central Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports in satisfied that without ascertaining further details in regard to such allegation the grant of licence or allotment of imported goods will not be in the public interest then notwithstanding anything contained in this Order the Central Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports may keep in abeyance any application for grant of licence from such person or direct <ORG> <ORG> or any other similar agency to keep in abeyance allotments of imported goods to such person without assigning any reason and without prejudice to any other action that may be taken in this behalf Provided that the period for which the grant of such licence or allotment is kept in abeyance under this clause shall not ordinarily exceeds six months Clause empowers <ORG> or the Chief Controller of <ORG> or any other officer authorised in that behalf to cancel any licence granted under the order or otherwise to render it ineffective for any of the reasons mentioned in the clause Yet another reason in If the licensee has committed a breach of any law relating to customs or the rules or regulations relating to <ORG> of goods or any other law relating to foreign exchange Clause i provides that no action shall be taken inter alia under Clause or Clause A or Clause against a licensee or importer or any other person unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard Clause enables any person aggrieved by any action taken under Clause or or A or to prefer an appeal to the authority constituted by <ORG> for that purpose We may notice here the argument of <NAME> that Clause excludes the application of Clause to goods covered by Open General Licence We find no substance in this submission In view of this non obstante clause we have no doubt that Clause applies equally to goods covered by Open General Licence We may mention at this juncture that Clauses A and were not to be found in the Imports Control Order originally but were introduced into it later by way of amendment to make provision for the making of interim orders pending investigation into allegation under Clause Clause A and refer to orders which may be made pending investigation into the allegations under Clause and by necessary implication expose the investigative content of Clause Clause expressly stipulates that action under Clause may not be taken unless a reasonable opportunity is given to the party concerned When facts come to the notice of the <ORG> or the Chief Controller of Imports which prima facie disclose an act or omission of the nature mentioned in Clause the authority may straight away communicate the allegations to the person concerned seek his answer and proceed to further investigate or the authority may consider it more prudent to further satisfy itself by seeking other evidence or material before communicating the allegations to the person concerned There is no rule of justice or fair play which requires the authority to seek the comments of the person concerned before embarking upon an investigation If so the authority may make an order under Clause A suspending the importation of goods the grant of licences or the allotment of imported goods In such cases the authority may make an order of abeyance under Clause Contextual construction demands such a construction and we have no hesitation in adopting it Does it mean that the principle of natural justice of procedural fairness is to be altogether excluded when action is taken under clause We do not think that it is permissible to interpret any statutory instruments so as to exclude natural justice unless the language of the instrument leaves no option to the court It may not even be necessary in some situations to issue such notices but it would be sufficient but obligatory to consider any representation that may be made by the aggrieved person and that would satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness and natural justice Ad interim orders may always be made ex parte and such orders may themselves provide for an opportunity to the aggrieved party to be heard at a later stage Even if the interim orders do not make provision for such an opportunity an aggrieved party has nevertheless always the right to make appropriate representation seeking a review of the order and asking the authority to rescind or modify the order There is no violation of a principle of natural justice if an ex parte ad interim order is made unless of course the statute itself provides for a hearing before the order is made as in clause A Natural justice will be violated if the authority refuses to consider the request of the aggrieved party for an opportunity to make his representation against the ex parte ad interim orders <ORG> of Canada had to consider the question whether an interim order under of the Post Office Act prohibiting the delivery of mail directed to or deposited by a person in <ORG> may be made without prior notice to the person affected pending the final determination which could only be made after hearing the party affected <ORG> said In it has not abrogated it i the application of the maxim audi alteram paterm Rather it has provided that before any final prohibitory order is made the party affected shall have notice and a right to an expeditions hearing and has defined the procedure to be followed Generally speaking the maxim audi alteram partem has reference to the making of decisions affecting the rights of parties which are final in their nature and this is true also of of the Canadian Bill of Rights Can upon which the respondents relied is in point Although cases may be found in the books of decisions under particular statues which at first might seem to conflict with the maxim it will be found on consideration that they are not inconsistent with it for the rule which is one of elementary justice only requires that a man shall not be subject to final judgment or to punishment without an opportunity of being heard That purpose might well be defeated if he could take action only after notice and a hearing Under the power conferred by section upon the Governor in Council to make regulations this very course seems to have been adopted Regulation I provides that if the judge is of the opinion that reasonable grounds have been shown i he may make the declaration immediately and ex parte if this seems to him necessary or desirable or ii if he thinks that an opportunity should be given to the owner or occupier or both to oppose the making of the declaration he may direct them to be served with a copy of the affidavit and to be notified of the day on which the matter will be dealt with such service and notification to be effected in such manner as may seem to him sufficient when the matter comes on the Superintendent or Inspector of Police or counsel or solicitor on his behalf and the owner and occupier or counsel or solicitor on their behalf may attend and be heard and the matter shall be disposed of in public chambers No one so far as I know has ever questioned such a suspension on the ground that it could not be done unless he is given notice of the charge and an opportunity of defending himself and so forth We have referred to these four cases only to illustrate how ex parte interim orders may be made pending a final adjudication An interim order of stay or suspension which has the effect of preventing a person however temporarily say from pursuing his profession or line of business may have substantial serious and even disastrous consequences to him and may expose him to grave risk and hazard But while clause deals with the right to obtain licences and the right to obtain allotments clause A deals with rights which have flowered into licences and allotments It is presumably because of this lively difference between clauses A and that clause provides for a pre decisional opportunity in the case of action under clause A and does not so provide in the case of action under clause Again it is presumably because of this difference that clause while providing for an appeal against a decision under clause A does not provide for an appeal against a decision under clause Not that it makes any difference because and of the Imports and Exports Control Act provide for an appeal and a revision against any decision or order made under the Act which naturally include any decision or made under any subordinate legislation made under the Act and this right of appeal and revision cannot be whittled down by the subordinate legislation The requirements of natural justice will be met in the case of action under clause by considering bona fide any representation that may be made in that behalf by the person aggrieved As we have earlier pointed out while ex parte interim orders may always be made without a pre decisional opportunity or without the order itself providing for a post decisional opportunity the principles of natural justice which are never excluded will be satisfied if a post decisional opportunity is given if demanded It is inconceivable that under our constitutional scheme a decision of the kind contemplated by clause which may have the effect of bringing to a stand still the entire business activity of the person affected and which may even spell ruin to him should be made and implemented without being communicated to that person There is nothing in clause to suggest that the decision is not to be communicated We must make it clear that without assigning reasons only means that there is no obligation to formulate reasons and nothing more So the authority may not give formal reasons but the skeletal allegations must be mentioned in order to provide an opportunity to the person affected to make his representation Chapter and verse need not be quoted The further question is on what should the satisfaction be based Since action under clause is to be taken pending investigation into allegations under clause we must take it that the action under clause is really in aid of the ultimate order under clause But strong public sentiment may impart a sense of urgency to a situation such as to compel the authorities to proceed to take action under a statute provided of course grounds for taking action under the statute That is how we understand the reference to public sentiment in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> and the Chief Controller of <ORG> If the threatened public mischief is such as to outweigh the likely injury to the party the authority may take action under Clause Which element of the public interest should be given greater weight and which grounds should weigh at all are matters for the authority taking action under Rule for import licencees and allotments of imported goods which have been kept in abeyance relate to goods which are totally unrelated to beef tallow or any other animal tallow and there was no justification whatever for keeping them in abeyance On the other hand even if the allegations are grave if the effect of an order under clause is likely to result in loses of considerable foreign exchange or to shut down an industry throwing large number of workers out of employment the authority should restrain itself in larger public interest from making an order under clause or may make an order confining the abeyance order to applications and goods of certain description only instead to making a general order which extends to all applications for import licences and allotment of imported goods A person who legitimately purchases imported goods or imports goods under a licence lawfully acquire by him and who has used the goods in the manufacture of a different kind of goods in which industry the person is engaged may not be visited with an order under clause merely because the original licensee actions may be suspicious But these are all matters for the consideration of the authority making the order under clause and not for the <ORG> We have held that action under Clause is of an interim nature and it may be ex parte in which case the affected party may make a suitable representation bringing out all the outweighing circumstances in his favour It was held in that case that forwarding of copies to the Accountant General and to the Chief Engineer was sufficient communication We might have considered the question of what relief the petitioners were entitled to had the secrecy been maintained and knowledge of the order continued to be held back from the party Since then a volume of water has flown under the bridge and we must proceed on the basis that the affected party is aware of the decision and so what next We can not of course proceed to consider the question whether there is sufficient relevant material in support of the allegations made against petitioners We cannot for example consider the question whether the material available justifies a prima facie conclusion that the petitioners have made illegal imports of beef tallow According to the contention of the petitioners they were entitled to import beef tallow even after June if they had valid licences and if they had entered into firm contracts and opened letters of credit before June According to the authorities to is was not permissible the affect of paragraph of the Import Policy was that the amendment which was made on June took effect from April and permitted import of beef tallow under OGL only where firm contracts had been entered into and letters of credit had been opened before April but if the contracts had not been entered into and letters of credit had not been opened before April the imports had to be through the channel of <ORG> only Though in the cases of <ORG> and <ORG> is an appeal and review arising under the provisions of the Customs Act the question was decided in favour of the parties the present stand of the Government is that those decisions are not binding on the authorities functioning under the Imports Control Order and that those decisions had been rendered without reference to paragraph as well paragraph of Appendix of the Import Policy of which expressly states Nothing in the Open General Licence shall affect the application to any goods of any other prohibition or regulation affecting the import thereof in force at the time where they are actually imported But we may properly consider even at this stage the question of mala fides or patent lack of jurisdiction There is no suggestion that the action was mala fides It was however argued that the order as embodied in the <ORG> circular did not fulfil the conditions precedent prescribed by the statute It did not contain a recital of the allegations constituting the basis of the satisfaction contemplated by clause for action under that provision and without a recital of the allegation it was impossible to say that the action was not based on irrelevant material There was ex facie nothing in the circular which could point to the authority having applied its mind and considered the case of each concern separately It is true that the <ORG> circular suffers from every one of these infirmities and if there was nothing more the parties would be well entitled to ask us to quash the circular But the learned Addl Solicitor General invited our attention to the statements made by <NAME> Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and the author of the <ORG> circulars in the counter affidavit filed by him Why the authority took the prima facie view that the petitioners had illegally imported beef tallow and had mis utilised the imported beef tallow has been explained by him in the counter affidavit Illegal importation of beef tallow and mis utilisation of the imported beef tallow are certainly relevant grounds on which action may be taken under clause Their cases having been considered by the authority separately and individually before the circular was issued we do not think that it makes any difference on the peculiar facts of this case that a single circular was issued covering a large number of concerns In cases involving civil liberties the orders will necessarily have to be quashed
