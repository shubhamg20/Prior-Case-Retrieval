DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH BHAGWATI BENCH BHAGWATI GUPTA A UNTWALIA CITATION AIR SCR SCC ACT Land Acquisition Act ss and Possession taken of acquired land Occupant resuming possession Effect of If <ORG> can withdraw from the acquisition On March the appellant filed a statement before the Land Acquisition Officer The Land Acquisition Officer passed orders in the presence of the appellant directing the <NAME> to take possession of the land and hand it over to the Principal of the <ORG> The <NAME> went to the spot inspected the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and took possession of the land leaving out the small portion containing the house of the appellant and handed over possession of the land so taken over to the Principal of the <ORG> The respondents and the <ORG> filed writ petitions in <ORG> challenging the release of the land <ORG> allowed the petitions holing that possession of the land was taken even though the <ORG> took the stand that they had taken only symbolical possession and given to the Principal of the College and that therefore it was not open to the Commissioner to withdraw from the acquisition under as amended by the Land Acquisition Maharashtra Extension and Amendment Act it must take actual Possession since all interests in the land are sought to be acquired by it and there is no question of taking symbolical possession as understood under the Nor would possession merely on paper be enough How such actual possession may be taken would depend on the nature of land It is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time though it may be desirable to do so in order to eliminate the possibility of a fraudulent or collusive transaction of talking of mere paper possession without the occupant or the owner ever knowing about it The Land Acquisition Officer thought that actual possession could not be regarded as having been taken unless the appellant was excluded from the land and since the appellant without any obstruction entered on the land and continued in possession he mistakenly stated that actual possession was not taken The legal position is that even if the appellant entered upon the land after actual possession had been taken by and the land vested in the <ORG> the appellant possession would not obliterate the consequence of vesting in the <ORG> A When a public notice under of the Act is published at a convenient place or near the land to be taken that <ORG> intends to take possession ordinarily there would be no question of resisting or impeding the taking of possession As to the mode of taking possession the Act is silent Unless possession is taken by the written agreement of the party concerned the mode of taking possession obviously would be for the authority to go upon the land and do some act which would indicate that the authority has taken possession of the land <NAME> We agree with the conclusion reached by our brother <NAME> as also with the reasoning on which the conclusion is based We think it is enough to state that when the Government proceeds to take possession of the land acquired by it under the Land Acquisition Act it must take actual possession of the land since all interests in the land are sought to be acquired by it There can be no question of taking symbolical possession in the sense understood by judicial decisions under the Code of Civil Procedure There can be no hard and fast rule laying down what act would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land We should not therefore be taken as laying down an absolute and inviolable rule that merely going on the pot and making a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land in every case But here in our opinion since the land was laying fallow and there was no crop on it at the material time the act of the Tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and determining its extent was sufficient to constitute taking of possession It appears that the appellant was not present when this was done by the Tehsildar but the presence of the owner or the occupant of the land is not necessary to effectuate the taking of possession It is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or the occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time though it may be desirable where possible to give such notice before possession is taken by the authorities as that would eliminate the possibility of any fraudulent or collusive transaction of taking of mere paper possession without the occupant or the owner ever coming to know of it This was plainly erroneous view for the legal position is clear that even if the appellant entered upon the land and resumed possession of it the very next moment after the land was actually taken possession of and became vested in the <ORG> such act on the part of the appellant did not have the effect of obliterating the consequences of vesting A notification under section of the Act was issued on the th January by which several pieces of land measuring acres gunthas gunthas make one acre were sought to be acquired including acres gunthas of Survey No in Village Umari Pargana <NAME> As the land was urgently required for the purpose of College action under section of the Act was taken dispensing with the following of the procedure under section A Actual possession of acres gunthas alongwith the other pieces of land measuring acres and odd was delivered to the Principal Agricultural <ORG> But it was asserted that <ORG> had taken only symbolical possession and the physical possession of the land remained with the appellant On consideration of the relevant materials placed before <ORG> it has come to the conclusion that actual possession of the land in question was taken and handed over on on the spot and even symbolical possession if land is occupied by a person other than the owner Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant submitted that possession of any portion of the land comprised in Survey No was not taken by the <ORG> or given to the Principal <ORG> it was all a paper delivery of possession no notice was ever given to the appellant as to the date and time of taking possession of the land on the spot and the sym bolical delivery of possession even if any Mr <NAME> appearing for the <ORG> and its authorities struck to their stand that only symbolical possession was taken and actual possession remained with the appellant It was further submitted that there is no provision in the Act requiring the giving of any notice to the possessor of the land of the exact date and time of taking possession on the spot and notice published under section is sufficient It may be stated at the outset that there does not seem to be any dispute as respects the fact that <NAME> and <NAME> were the owners of the land at the time of the issuance of the notification under section of the Act and the appellant was in its occupation or actual possession as a tenant It is also not in dispute that possession was taken on in respect of the large portion of land measuring more than acres There is no controversy that the <ORG> not only needed the land in question but subsequently steps were taken for acquiring an additional area of acres for the needs of the <ORG> The Commissioner in his order dated th February had directed that the possession of the land may be taken on the expiration of days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section of the Act On various other persons including the appellant appeared before the Land Acquisition Officer On this date the land Acquisition Officer recorded the order in presence of the parties including the appellant directing <NAME> to take possession of the land and hand it over to the Principal <ORG> in the presence of <ORG> Akola and to report compliance with possession receipt by He stated that he was interested in the field as be was its protected lessee and as such he was entitled to receive compensation that may be granted It would thus be seen that in his written statement filed on the appellant did not deny the publication of notice on the spot under section nor did he propose to put any impediment in the taking of possession of the land comprised in Survey No The Principal of <ORG> wrote a letter to the SubDivision Officer and Land Acquisition Officer <NAME> on the th April with an endorsement of the Revenue Inspector who it appears was the Tehsildar stating therein that he had taken possession of the fields mentioned below in the letter on the rd April in presence of the Sub Divisional Officer and <NAME> <NAME> On the facts and in the circumstances of this case it is difficult to accept the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant that the taking and giving of possession on was only on paper and not on the spot <ORG> in its judgment has referred to a letter dated by the Land Acquisition Officer to the Collector <NAME> to say that the appellant represented before him that a stay order had been passed in respect of Survey No by the Minister for Agriculture and the proceedings for taking possession of this land may be deferred pending further instructions from the higher authorities but before any step could be taken on the representation of the appellant the land Acquisition Officer got the information that possession had been taken and given but in spite of that in the letter dated a direction was given to the Tehsildar to withhold taking possession of the field in Survey No of village Umari temporarily As a matter of fact it would appear from the letter dated written by the Assistant Secretary of <ORG> to the appellant in reply to his letter addressed to the Minister for Agriculture a copy of which was forwarded to the Collector <NAME> that for the first time in this letter he was requested to stay the proceedings until further orders Then comes the letter dated written by the Land Acquisition Officer to the Collector <NAME> But then in this very letter there is a statement The Collector <NAME> was directed to stay the acquisition proceedings in respect of this field until further orders though possession receipt for No was passed on the possession physical of the entire field No of Umari is still retained by the lessee of that field and the land was not actually taken possession of by the Principal <ORG> <NAME> The question for consideration is was the release valid and proper In order to appreciate what is meant by taking possession of the land under section or of the Act and what is the mode of taking such possession in regard to the waste or arable land with which we are concerned in this case it is necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure hereinafter called the Code and some decisions thereon On the other band if the property is of such a nature that the judgment debtor cannot be in actual occupation of it as for instance property in the possession of a tenant the only mode of giving possession is by proclaiming on the spot that the possession has been given to the decree holder or the auction purchaser The plaintiffs had filed a suit to recover possession of the said land Their Lordships see no reason to question it or to hold that this rule of procedure should now be altered In the case of joint possession the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case A I Privy Council has been referred with approval by this Court in the case of <NAME> <NAME> and others in paragraph at page in the judgment of <NAME> as he then was as also in paragraph at page is that of <NAME> I may just quote a sentence from paragraph which says By the delivery of symbolical possession under the order of November the adverse possession of the defendants was interrupted In that case the question of defendants adverse possession arose with reference to a property which was not in occupation of any tenant The question arose in a criminal case and the confusion arising out of the use of the expressions the actual and symbolical possession was again discussed at page The momentary possession given to the purchaser was characterised as delivery of symbolical possession by the Additional Sessions Judge and not actual possession It is wrong to think that there Are two kinds of delivery of possession one actual and the other symbolical independent of the nature of possession of the judgment debtor lm The next question is whether it makes any difference in legal effect if possession is taken through court The Code contemplates no notice to the judgment debtor at that stage or any objection being raised by him to the delivery of possession under Rule or Rule and as the full title to the property has passed from the judgment debtor to the auction purchaser he has no interest in the property to protect Section of the Act reads as follows The Collector shall then cause public notice to be given at convenient places or near the land to be taken stating that the Government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land may be made to him When a public notice is published at a convenient place or near the land to be taken stating that the <ORG> intends to take possession of the land then ordinarily and generally there would be no question of resisting or impeding the taking of possession But the question is what is the mode of taking possession The Act is silent on the point Unless possession is taken by the written agreement of the party concerned the mode of taking possession obviously would be for the authority to go upon the land and to do some act which would indicate that the authority has taken possession of the land Viewed in the light of the discussion of law I have made above it would be noticed that possession of the land in any event was taken on the spot and it vested in the <ORG> was not at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any portion of the land of which possession had been taken under section of the Act
