HEADNOTE <ORG> passed an Act entitled the Bombay Sales Tax Act which imposed by a general tax on every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales within the <ORG> of Bombay during the prescribed period exceeded Rs and by a special tax on every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales of special goods made within the <ORG> of Bombay exceeded Rs The term sale was defined in as meaning any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration and an Explanation to this definition provided that the sale of any goods which have actually been delivered in the <ORG> of Bombay as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in the said <ORG> shall be deemed for the purposes of the Act to have taken place in the said <ORG> irrespective of the fact to at the property in the goods has by reason of such sale passed in another <ORG> Rules and of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules which were brought into force on the same day on which ss and of the Bombay Sales Tax Act came into force provided for the deduction of the following sales in calculating the taxable turnover viz sales which take place a in the course of the import of the goods into or the export of the goods out of the territory of India and in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce being the two kinds of sales referred to cl and cl respectively of art of the Constitution challenging the validity of the Act and praying inter alia for a writ against the <ORG> of Bombay and the Collector of Sales Tax Bombay restraining them from enforcing the provisions of the Act <ORG> held that the definition of sale in the Act was so wide as to include the three categories of sale exempted by art of the Constitution from the imposition of tax by the <ORG>s and as the Act imposed a tax on all such sales it was wholly void On appeal Held per <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> dissenting that the Bombay Sales Tax Act XXIV of was not ultra vires <ORG> on the ground that it contravened art Article a of the Constitution read with the Explanation thereto and construed in the light of art and art prohibits the taxation of sales or purchases involving inter<ORG> elements by all <ORG>s except the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein The view that the Explanation does not deprive the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passed of its taxing power and that consequently both the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passes and the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption have the power to tax is not correct iv The fact that sales which take place a in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India and in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce are not expressly exempted by the Bombay Sales Tax Act could not render the Act ultra vires inasmuch as the Rules framed under the Act and brought into force simultaneously must be read as a part of the Act and Rules and of these Rules exempt such sales a sales or purchases in respect of goods delivered for consumption outside Bombay are not taxable under the Act even if the goods are in Bombay and the sale is effected there and as it can only apply to transactions which in truth and in fact take place in the course of <ORG> trade and commerce there is no need to call it in aid until the ban is removed iii Explanation to the definition of sale in of the Bombay Sales Tax Act which embodies word for word the provisions of the Explanation to art <NAME> Under the general law relating to sale of goods a sale must be regarded as having taken place in the <ORG> in which the property in the goods sold has passed to the purchaser and that <ORG> is entitled to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the <ORG> does not take away the right which the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passed has to tax the sale or purchase but only deems such purchase or sale by a legal fiction to have taken place in the <ORG> in which the delivery of the goods has been made for consumption therein so as to enable the latter <ORG> also to tax the sale or purchase in question The Explanation only lifts the ban imposed by cl a on taxation of sales or purchases which take place outside the <ORG> to the extent of the transactions mentioned in the Explanation to enable the delivery <ORG> also to tax them therefore only covers those cases where as a direct result of the sale or purchase goods are delivered for consumption in the delivery <ORG> by the consumer and the delivery <ORG> can tax only this limited class of transactions under the Explanation a enabling the delivery <ORG> to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of cases covered by the Explanation the transactions covered by the Explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the <ORG> and thus invested with the character of an intra state sale or purchase so far as the delivery <ORG> is concerned <ORG> enacted the Bombay Sales Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and it was brought into force on October by notification issued under section of the Act except sections and which came into operation on November as notified under section On the same day the rules made by the State Government in exercise of the power conferred by section of the Act also came into force On November the respondents to who are companies incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and respondent No a partnership firm all of whom are carrying on business in Bombay of buying and selling motor cars presented a petition to <ORG> under article of the Constitution challenging the validity of the Act on the ground that it is ultra vires <ORG> inasmuch as it purported to tax sales arid purchases of goods regardless of the restrictions imposed on State legislative power by article of the Constitution A further ground of attack was added by amendment of the petition to the effect that the Act being wholly ultra vires and void the provisions requiring dealers to apply for registration in some cases and to obtain a licence in some others as a condition of carrying on their business infringed the fundamental rights of the respondents under article of the Constitution In the affidavit filed in answer the appellants traversed the allegations in the petition and contended inter alia that the Act was a complete code and provided for special machinery for dealing with all questions arising under it including questions of constitutionality and therefore the petition was not maintainable that the present ease was not an appropriate one for the issue of a writ under article as the validity of the imposition of a tax was questioned that no assessment proceedings having been initiated against the respondents and no demand notice having been issued the respondents had no cause of action and that properly construed the Act and the Rules did not contravene article or any other provisions of the Constitution and did not infringe any fundamental right of the respondents The petition was heard by a Division Bench of <ORG> consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> who delivered the judgment <NAME> concurring overruled the preliminary objection disdistinguishing the decisions cited in support thereof by pointing out that the principle that a court would not issue a prerogative writ when an adequate alternative remedy was available could not apply where as here a party came to the court with an allegation that his fundamental rights had been infringed and sought relief under article The learned Judges rejected the argument that the Act and the Rules must be read together to see whether the State has made a law imposing a tax in contravention of article remarking that if the Act itself is bad the rules made under it cannot have any greater efficacy Nor was the Government which was authorised to make rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act under an obligation to exclude the exempted sales In the present case however the appellants can have no grievance as the respondents allegation of infringement of their fundamental right under article was based on their contention that the Act was ultra vires the State Legislature and that contention having been accepted by the <ORG> below there would clearly be an unauthorised restriction on the respondents right to carry on their trade registration and licence being required only to facilitate collection of the tax imposed Before considering whether the appellant <ORG> has made a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on sales or purchases of goods in disregard of constitutional restrictions on its legislative power in that behalf it is necessary to ascertain the scope of such power and the nature and extent of the restrictions placed upon it by article The power is conferred by article read with entry of List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The <ORG> of any <ORG> has under these provisions the exclusive power to make laws for such <ORG> or any part thereof with respect to taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers In the case of sales tax it is not necessary that the sale or purchase should take place within the territorial limits of the <ORG> in the sense that all the ingredients of a sale like the agreement to sell the passing of title delivery of the goods etc In exercise of the legislative power conferred upon them in substantially similar terms by the Government of India Act the Provincial Legislatures enacted sales tax laws for their respective Provinces acting on the principle of territorial nexus referred to above that is to say they picked out one or more of the ingredients constituting a sale and made them the basis of their sales tax legislation No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the State or in the course of the import of the goods into nor export of the goods out of the territory of India For the purposes of sub clause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State Except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce Provided that the President may by order direct that any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause continue to be levied until the thirty first day of March No law made by the <ORG> of a State im posing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent Notwithstanding anything in article or article <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced and impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause shall be introduced or moved in the <ORG> of a <ORG> without the previous sanction of the President It will be seen that the principle of freedom of inter <ORG> trade and commerce declared in article is expressly subordinated to the <ORG> power of taxing goods imported from sister <ORG>s provided only no discrimination is made in favour of similar goods of local origin Thus the <ORG>s in India have full power of imposing what in American <ORG> legislation is called the use tax gross receipts tax etc not to speak of the familiar property tax subject only to the condition that such tax is imposed on all goods of the same kind produced or manufactured in the taxing <ORG> although such taxation is undoubtedly calculated to fetter inter <ORG> trade and commerce In other words the commercial unity of India is made to give way before the <ORG> power of imposing any non dis criminatory tax on goods imported from sister <ORG>s Having thus provided for the freedom of inter <ORG> trade and commerce subject to the important qualification mentioned above the authors of the Constitution had to devise a formula of restrictions to be imposed on the <ORG> power of taxing sales or purchases involving inter <ORG> elements which would avoid the doubts and difficulties arising out of the imposition of sales tax on the same transaction by several Provincial <ORG>s in the country before the commencement of the Constitution Clause a prohibits the taxation of all sales or purchases which take place outside the <ORG> but a localised sale is a troublesome concept for a sale is a composite transaction involving as it does several elements such as agreement to sell transfer of ownership payment of the price delivery of the goods and so forth which may take place at different places How then is it to be determined whether a particular sale or purchase took place within or outside the <ORG> It is difficult to say that any one of the ingredients mentioned above is more essential to a sale or purchase than the others It provides by means of a legal fiction that the <ORG> in which the goods sold or purchased are actually delivered for consumption therein is the <ORG> in which the sale or purchase is to be considered to have taken place notwithstanding the property in such goods passed in another <ORG> It is however argued on behalf of Bombay that the Explanation does not say that the <ORG> of delivery is the only <ORG> in which the sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place Nor can the non obstante clause be understood as implying that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the passing of the property in the goods is the determining factor in locating a sale or purchase Neither the Sale of Goods Act nor the common law relating to the sale of goods has anything to say as to what the situs of a sale is though certain rules have been laid down for ascertaining the intention of the contracting parties as to when or under what conditions the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer That question often raises ticklish problems for lawyers and courts and to make the passing of title the determining factor in the location of a sale or purchase would be to replace old uncertainties and difficulties connected with the nexus basis with new ones It was then said that the formula of delivery for consumption within a <ORG> could only cover the com paratively few cases of sales or purchases taking place directly between the consumers in the delivery <ORG> and dealers in other <ORG>s and <ORG> sales or purchases between dealers in either <ORG> which must be larger in number and volume would still be outside the scope of the Explanation which could not therefore have been intended to empower only one <ORG> namely the delivery <ORG> to tax all <ORG> sales or purchases We see no force in this objection Nor do the words as a direct result have reference to consumption We are therefore of opinion that article a read with the Explanation prohibits taxation of sales or purchases involving inter State elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein in the wider sense explained above The sale by a trader in one <ORG> to a user in another would be a sale in the course of inter <ORG> trade according to the natural meaning of those words and we can see no reason for importing the restriction that the transaction should be one between two traders only We are of opinion that the operation of clause stands excluded as a result of the legal fiction enacted in the explanation and the <ORG> in which the goods are actually delivered for consumption can impose tax on inter <ORG> sales or purchases When once however it is determined with the aid of the fictional test that a particular sale or purchase has taken place within the taxing <ORG> it follows as a corollary that the transaction loses its inter <ORG> character and falls outside the purview of clause not because the definition in the Explanation is used for the purpose of clause but because such sale or purchase becomes in the eye of the law a purely local transaction On the other hand there are in our judgment cogent considerations which tend to support the view we have expressed above that clause was not intended to affect the power of the delivery <ORG> to tax inter <ORG> sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in the Explanation As we have seen in our Constitution the principle of freedom of inter <ORG> trade and commerce is made to give way before the <ORG> power of imposing non discriminatory taxes on goods imported from other <ORG>s As article deals with restrictions on the power of the <ORG>s to impose tax on the sale or purchase of goods the Constitution makers evidently thought that it should contain also a specific provision safeguarding sales or purchases of an inter <ORG> character against the taxing power of the <ORG>s If such protection is intended to give way before the <ORG> power of taxing goods imported from sister <ORG>s subject only to the condition against discrimination it is legitimate to suppose that the ban under article should not operate so as to nullify that power But this distinc tion loses its practical importance in the case of sales tax imposed by the delivery <ORG> under the conditions mentioned in the Explanation for if we look behind the labels at the substance of the matter it becomes clear that a tax on sales or purchases imposed by the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption in the sense already explained is in economic effect practically indistinguishable from a tax on the consumption or use of the goods The object clearly is to assimilate the conditions under which the delivery <ORG> is left free to tax inter <ORG> sales or purchases to those under which a <ORG> is empowered to impose tax on goods imported into the <ORG> from other <ORG>s under article a <NAME> article on goods imported from other <ORG>s does not infringe the freedom of inter <ORG> commerce declared by article parity of reason and policy requires that a tax on sales or purchases imposed by the <ORG> in which the goods are actually delivered for consumption in the <ORG> should not be regarded as violative of the ban under article and that is what the statutory fiction enacted in the Explanation was in our judgment designed to achieve by divesting the sale or purchase of the kind referred There is another important consideration which strongly supports the view we have indicated above namely article does not affect the taxation of such sale or purchase by the <ORG> of delivery The Act provides for levy of two kinds of taxes called the general tax and the special tax by the two charging sections and respectively Dealer is defined in section as a person who carries on the business of selling goods in the State of Bombay whether for commission remuneration or otherwise and includes a State Government which carries on such business and any society club or association which sells goods to its members The Expla nation to this definition provides that the manager or agent of a dealer who resides outside the State of Bombay and carries on the business of selling goods in the State of Bombay shall in respect of such business be deemed to be a dealer for the purpose of the Act There are two Explanations attached to this definition of which the second which is obviously based on the Explanation to clause a of article provides that the sale of any goods which have actually been delivered in the State of Bombay as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in the said State shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have taken place in the said State irrespective of the fact that the property in the goods has by reason of such sale passed in another State Turnover is defined by section as the aggregate of the amounts of sale price received and receivable by a dealer in respect of any sale of goods made during a given period after deducting the amount if any refunded by the dealer to a purchaser in respect of any goods purchased and returned by the purchaser within the prescribed period Section imposes the general tax on every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales within the State of Bombay during any of the three consecutive years immediately preceding the first day of April has exceeded Rs By section the taxable turnover is to be determined by first deducting from the turnover of the dealer in respect of all his sales of goods during any period of his liability to pay the general tax his turnover during that period in respect of a sales of any goods declared from time to time as tax free under section and such other sales as may be prescribed No dealer liable to pay the general tax shall carry on business as a dealer unless he has applied for registration section By section every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales of special goods made within the State of Bombay has exceeded Rs during the year ended st March or exceeds the said limit during the year commencing from st April is charged with a special tax at the rate specified in Schedule on his taxable turnover in respect of the sales of special goods made on or after the appointed day i st November Every dealer liable to pay the special tax is required to obtain a licence as a condition of his carrying on his business section Chapter VI contains provisions for production of accounts supply of information and cancellation of registration or licence Chapter VII deals with proceedings including appeals and revision and the determination of certain questions of law by reference to <ORG> Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act In exercise of the powers conferred by this section <ORG> made and published rules called the Bombay Sales Tax Rules which were brought into force on the same day on which the charging sections and of the Act were also brought into force namely November Of these Rules and are important and they provide for the deduction of the following sales in calculating taxable turnover under section general tax and section special tax sales which take place a in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India or in the course of inter State trade or commerce Clause lays down a rule of presumption to be acted upon in the absence of evidence of actual consignment of the goods within three months of the sale that the sale has not taken place in the course of export or of inter State trade as the case may be Now it will be seen from the provisions summarised above that the Act does not in terms exclude from its purview the sales or purchases taking place outside the State of Bombay while it does include by Explanation to the definition of sale the sales or purchases under which the delivery and consumption take place in Bombay which by virtue of the Explanation to article a are to be regarded as local sales or purchases On the construction we have placed upon that Explanation sales or purchases effected in Bombay in respect of goods in Bombay but delivered for consumption outside Bombay are not taxable in Bombay No doubt there is no provision in the Act excluding in express terms sales of the kind referred to above but neither is there any provision purporting to impose tax on such sales or purchases On the other hand the two charging sections of the Act section and section purport in express terms to impose the tax on all sales made within the State of Bombay and section which lays the tax on purchases is limited in its operation to purchases of goods delivered to a buyer in the State of Bombay for consumption therein that is to say to purchases which unquestionably are taxable by Bombay according to both parties We see no force therefore in the argument that the Act contravenes the provisions of article a by purporting to charge sales or purchases excluded by that article from State taxation The position therefore was that on the date when the general tax and the special tax became leviable under the Act sales or purchases of the kind described under article and stood in fact excluded from taxation and the <ORG> of Bombay cannot be considered to have made a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on sales or purchases excluded under the aforesaid clauses of article The Act and the rules having been brought into operation simultaneously there is no obvious reason why the rules framed in exercise of the power delegated by the <ORG> should not be regarded as part of the law made by the <ORG> Objection was also taken to clause of It is said that there is no reason why sales of goods despatched by other modes of transport should not also be deducted from the taxable turnover because article in exempting sales in the course of <ORG> trade makes no distinction between modes of transport by which the goods are despatched The restriction regarding the mode of transport of the goods sold or purchased in the course of <ORG> trade to which alone sub rule relates can be ignored and the exemption under rule may well be allowed to stand But no discrimination is involved in this classification which is perfectly reason able when it is borne in mind that the State may not consider it administratively worthwhile to tax sales by small traders who have no organisational facilities for collecting the tax from their buyers and turn it over to the Government Apart from the considerations set forth above which tend to support the constitutional validity of the Act it was broadly contended before us that taxing statutes imposing tax on subjects divisible in their nature which do not exclude in express terms subjects exempted by the Constitution should not for that reason be declared wholly ultra vires and void for in such cases it is always feasible to separate taxes levied on authorised subjects from those levied on exempted subjects and to exclude the latter in the assessment of the tax Disagreeing with this view their Lordships made the following observations which were strongly relied on before us The majority of <ORG> appear to have contemplated another form of severability namely by a classification of the particular cases on which the impugned Act may happen to operate involving an inquiry into the circumstances of each individual case There are no words in the Act capable of being so construed and such a course would in effect involve an amendment of the Act by the court a course which is beyond the competency of the court as has long been well established The same principle was applied by this court in the Cross Roads case It was indeed applied also in <NAME> case with respect to the licence tax imposed generally on the entire business conducted including inter State commerce as well as domestic business but was not applied as stated above with respect to excise tax which was laid on every gallon of gasolene sold and was thus divisible in its nature Each party will bear its own costs throughout <NAME> have had the advantage of reading the judgments of my Lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother <NAME> I also agree that the object of the Explanation is to fix the locus of a sale or purchase by means of a fiction but with respect I cannot agree with my brother <NAME> that the non obstante clause enunciates the general law on this point What the general law does is to determine the place where the property passes in the absence of a special agree ment but the place where the property passes is not necessarily the place where the sale takes place nor has that ever been regarded as the determining factor Before the passing of the Constitution different States or Provinces as they then were claimed the right to tax the same transaction for a variety of reasons which have been pointed out by my Lord the Chief Justice It seems to me that the Constitution makers considered this detrimental to the development and exercise of trade and commerce and so determined to put a stop to the practice but at the same time left <ORG> a discretion to restore a part of the status quo if and when it should think it safe and desirable to do so The narrowing of the powers was accomplished by stating in article that no <ORG> can impose a tax on a sale or purchase which takes place outside the <ORG> by stating that it cannot tax a sale or purchase in the course of import or export and by prohibiting taxes on sales and purchases which take place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce unless <ORG> chooses to lift the ban Reading these together in a simple and straightforward way it seems clear to me that the idea was to permit <ORG>s to tax only what I might call intra state sales and purchases at any rate to begin with So long as the ban imposed by clause remains there is no difficulty because when parts of a sale take place in different States the transaction is inter State and no tax can be imposed The Constitution makers had before them the existing practice of the States based on the nexus theory and so it became necessary to define just where a sale takes place in order to carry out the main theme that only intra astate sales can be taxed When this is done a sale is found to consist of a number of ingredients which can be said to be essential in the sense that if any one of them is missing there is no sale The following are some of them the existence of goods which form the subject matter of the sale the bargain or contract which when executed will result in the passing of the property in the goods for a price the payment or promise of payment of a price the passing of the title There is then no sale The distinc tion is I think clear when it is realised that apart from the Explanation a sale or a purchase can be taxed even though the goods are never actually delivered and even if they never reach the taxing <ORG> for the right is to tax the sale or purchase and that is something quite independent of actual delivery The goods might be destroyed by flood or fire before there is any chance of actual delivery <NAME> Government of India be delivered in a totally different State but the tax could still be levied if there was no Explanation to stop it I find it difficult to see how article could ever come into effective play if article is applied to sales and purchases which take place in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce A I do not think the change in language a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods in the one case and a tax on goods imported from other States was accidental nor do I think we will be justified in ignoring the fact that the two are placed in different parts of the Constitution In this I agree with my brother <NAME> With respect I cannot agree that the Explanation is really an exception and I do not think the non obstante clause means that under the general lay the lace where the property passes was regarded as the place where the sale takes place for that in itself would be a fiction There is no such law In my opinion all it means is that there was a school of thought which regarded that as the crucial element on the nexus view and that the Constitution has negatived that idea Its purposes to prohibit taxation on sales and purchases which take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce Having served its purpose it follows as a corollary that there is no inter State transaction left and so clause is not called into play In my opinion by parity of reasoning if the sale is intra state and cannot now be regarded as external to the State it equally cannot be said to take place in the course of export or import in a case of that kind for export and import predicate the movement of goods across a boundary just as surely as inter State trade and commerce Now even when the situs of a sale is in truth and in fact inside a <ORG> with no essential ingredient taking place outside nevertheless if it takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade and commerce it will be hit by clause just as surely as it is hit by sub clause when it takes place in the course of export or import sale took place whether it was in the course of inter state trade and commerce in the one case or in the course of export or import in the other for the stream of inter State trade and commerce as also that of export and import will catch up in its vortex all sales which take place in its course wherever the situs of the sale may be Under it the President is empowered to direct the continuation for a period of a tax which was being lawfully levied at the date of the Constitution even though the transaction is of an inter State character and we find that in some of the cases which have come before us that was done the moment the Constitution came into force But of course that means that the empowering can only be in favour of the State in which the goods are actually delivered for the purpose of consumption in that State as a direct result of a purchase or sale effected for that purpose So long as the ban exists there is no need for the Explanation for the explanation only covers sales or purchases which are <ORG> It is true it makes an arbitrary selection but then almost any selection would have to be arbitrary and this is as good as any other The question how ever arises what is to happen to clause a while the ban lasts if the Explanation is to be ignored during that period How is the situs of a sale to be determined in the difficult class of cases which arose before the Constitution and which in my view occasioned the ban The ban does not apply and there is no need to call in aid the Explanation for I repeat that the Explanation is limited to cases which in truth and in fact take place in the course of <ORG> trade and commerce Can either the sale by A to or the purchase by from A be taxed In my view it cannot for is in my judgment as much a consumer as and It is true the word can be used in a wide as well as a narrow sense but I see no reason to restrict its meaning in the present case In the same way a man who purchases goods for use in his business so that his business can be carried on by the constant feeding of a stream uses the goods and therefore consumes them even though he does not keep them himself If this is found to work hardship on the States in practice then <ORG> which has been given the power to regulate inter State trade and commerce under Entry of List can step in and lift the ban In the former class of case the carrier would normally be regarded as the agent of the Madras purchaser and the result would be that delivery would in that event be deemed to be delivery in Bombay and that would give Bombay the right to tax and not Madras In my opinion the inter State character of the course ends when the goods reach the first consumer in the taxing State When he in turn sells to the ultimate consumer in that State a different course begins namely the course of intra state trade But if still in Madras purchases direct from <ORG> in Bombay there is only one tax in the transaction on my Lord view That still gives <ORG> an advantage over Therefore there is a large class of cases in which the local dealer is at a disadvantage even on the other view Similar considerations apply in the case of exports and imports <NAME> The Act came into force on th October with the exception of the taxing sections It is said that the rules have excluded all sales which offend the Constitution therefore under the law by which is meant the Act and the rules read together which came into being on st November no sale exempted by the Constitution can be taxed Rules are made by a subordinate authority which is not the <ORG> and I cannot agree that the validity of an Act of a competent <ORG> can be made to depend upon what some subordinate authority chooses to do or not to do We are therefore called upon to determine the validity of the Act and in doing so we must in my opinion ignore the rules On the question of severability I cannot see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the Explanation to section be expunged unless the Constitution be read as part of the Act and we are to read into the Act some such provision as follows Notwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this Act all sales which the <ORG> is prohibited to tax under the Constitution are excluded from the scope of this Act On the contrary section says that the Government may make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act and one of the purposes is to tax all sales which <ORG> wishes to tax With all respect to the American Judges who hold that view I would prefer not to make exceptions The power given to <ORG> to tax the sales or purchases of goods is derived from article read with Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution That power has got to be widely construed and it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases of goods by reason of a sufficient territorial connection between the taxing <ORG> and what it seeks to tax These restrictions were threefold no tax could be imposed on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place outside the <ORG> no tax could be imposed on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of the import of goods into or the export of the goods out of the territory of India and no tax could be imposed on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce except in so far as <ORG> might by law otherwise provide The phraseology used in the article laid particular stress on the fact that the sale or purchase should take place so as to fall within one or the other of these categories The intention was that the sale or purchase should take place i should be completed either outside the <ORG> or in the course of import or export or in the course of inter<ORG> trade or commerce The sales or purchases could be divided into two broad categories sales or purchases which take place inside the <ORG> and sales or purchases which take place outside the <ORG> and those which took place outside the <ORG> were certainly outside the taxing powers of the <ORG> In regard to the sales or purchases which took place inside the <ORG> the sales or purchases which took place in the course of import or export and in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce were also brought within the ban leaving the taxing power of the <ORG> unfettered in regard to the other sales or purchases which took place inside the <ORG> The restrictions which were thus imposed on the taxing power of the <ORG> confined themselves to sales or purchases which took place outside the <ORG> and those sales or purchases which took place inside the <ORG> but took place in the course of import or export and in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce Once the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was accepted as the sole criterion of taxability it was not necessary at all to define what was a sale or purchase which took place inside the <ORG> Whether a sale or purchase took place inside the <ORG> could be determined by applying the general law relating to the sale of goods and ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed It was only when the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed that the sale or purchase was completed and the sale or purchase took place and the situs or the location of the sale or purchase was in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed under the general law relating to the sale of goods They therefore incorporated in article the notion of a sale or purchase taking place i being completed by the transfer of ownership or the passing of property in the goods under the general law relating to sale of goods and enacted that those sales or purchases which took place outside the <ORG> or which even though they took place inside the <ORG> took place in the course of the import or export or in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce should come within the ban imposed therein The Constitution makers however took count of the fact that even though the property in the goods by reason of the sale or purchase passed in a particular <ORG> the goods might as a direct result of such sale or purchase be delivered in another <ORG> for the purpose of consumption in that <ORG> They wanted to give the delivery <ORG> in that event the power to tax such sale or purchase and therefore introduced by the Explanation to article a a legal fiction by which A What otherwise would have been a sale or purchase which took place outside the State within the meaning of article a was thus by legal fiction deemed to have taken place inside the delivery State thus assimilating the position to a sale or purchase which took place inside the delivery State enabling the delivery State to tax the sale or purchase in question This legal fiction was thus introduced not for defining what was a sale or purchase which took place inside the State as distinct from a sale or purchase which took place outside the State The purpose of the enactment of the Explanation was not to provide a definition of a sale or purchase which took place inside the State That was determined under the general law relating to the sale of goods by ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed which was in another State and not the delivery State What was a sale or purchase which took place outside the State was by reason of the Explanation and the legal fiction enacted therein deemed to be a sale or purchase which took place inside the State so as to enable the delivery State to tax the sale or purchase in question those in which as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery State for the purposes of consumption in that State They do not comprise all the transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the State because besides those there are a large number of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the State and in which no element of inter State trade or commerce enters the transaction The transactions of sale or purchase which take place between dealers and dealers and dealers and customers all within the State are really comprised in the category of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the State and these transactions do not at all fall within the purview of the Explanation It would be surprising to find a definition of a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the State given in the manner in which it is alleged to have been done in the Explanation covering only those transactions of sale or purchase in which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery State as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State A definition if at all it has any significance should cover all the transactions which come within that particular category and cannot be enacted in the form of a legal fiction in the manner it has been done in the Explanation It has no reference to facts but it merely enacts a legal fiction under which a sale which under the general law relating to sale of goods is completed outside the State by the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods in another State is deemed to have taken place inside the delivery State because of the goods having been actually delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consump tion in the delivery State What is otherwise a sale or purchase which takes place outside the State is thus deemed to have taken place inside the delivery State and that is the only purpose of the enactment of the Explanation The contention of the Attorney General and Shri <NAME> that the purpose of the enactment of the Explanation was to define what was a sale or purchase which took place inside the State is therefore unsound The non obstante clause really takes count of the fact that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods by reason of such sale or purchase would pass in another <ORG> and that the situs or location of the sale would accordingly be therefore in another <ORG> Besides this ingredient there were various other ingredients which had been similarly considered sufficient territorial connections and to consider that the ingredient of the passing of property in the goods was the only ingredient which was considered important to be mentioned in the non obstante clause is to ignore the facts and do violence to the whole conception underlying the incorporation of the non obstante clause in the Explanation It would be a more natural way of reading the non obstante clause to read into it an intention to state what according to the Constitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that notwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the Explanation was none the less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery <ORG> If the Explanation to article a is construed in the manner indicated above it follows that notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State the sale shall be deemed to have taken place in the delivery State and the delivery State would be entitled to tax the sale or purchase Under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods having by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State that State will no doubt be entitled to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the State The object of the Explanation is not and could not be to take away the right which the State in which the property in the goods passed had to tax the sale or purchase which took place inside that State The object of article is to impose restrictions on the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of goods and the only restriction which has been imposed in connection with the sales or purchases which take place in this manner is that a State shall not impose a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the State It is no doubt true that in the Explanation the word only has not been used nor has the word also been used and we have to gather the purpose of the enactment of the Explanation from the words of the Explanation itself In order to arrive at a conclusion whether the object and purpose of the Explanation was to enable the delivery <ORG> to tax such sales or purchases either in addition to the <ORG> in which the property in the goods had passed or in substitution thereof one has got to bear in mind the basic idea that a <ORG> would normally be entitled to tax a sale or purchase where such sale or purchase took place inside the <ORG> except in cases covered by article and article If that power of the <ORG> to tax the sale or purchase where such sale or purchase took place inside the <ORG> was in any manner whatever sought to be taken away it could only be taken away by an express enactment in that behalf as in article and article and not by the backdoor as it were by enacting a legal fiction as it has been done in the Explanation If this position is borne in mind it is clear that not only would the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passed continue to be entitled to tax the sale or purchase because of such sale or purchase having taken place inside the <ORG> but the delivery <ORG> would also be entitled to tax such sale or purchase by reason of the operation of the legal fiction in so far as the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase in the delivery <ORG> for the purpose of consumption in that <ORG> That sale or purchase has to be one as a direct result of which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery State for the purpose of consumption in that State A dealer who deals with the goods after purchasing the same does not consume the goods Delivery of goods for the purpose of consumption in the delivery <ORG> therefore means the delivery for the purpose of using by the consumer and it has no application to the case of a dealer purchasing the goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary course of trade The Explanation therefore covers only those cases where as a direct result of the sale or purchase goods are delivered for consumption in the delivery <ORG> by the consumer and it is only that limited class of transactions which are covered by the Explanation and which are liable to tax by the delivery <ORG> I do not accept the contention that the words for the purpose of consumption must be understood in a com prehensive sense as having reference both to immediate and ultimate consumption within the <ORG> and excluding only resale out of the <ORG> In my opinion they have reference only to immediate consumption within the <ORG> and no further If the matters stood thus and there was no further provision to be considered the position would be that in a transaction of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation construed as above both the State in which the property in the goods passed and the delivery State would be entitled to tax such sale or purchase the former by reason of the property in the goods having passed inside that State and the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State It was contended and rightly so by the AdvocateGeneral of Bombay that if the transactions which are covered by the Explanation to article a were thus hit by article in the absence of a provision otherwise enacted by <ORG> the Explanation to article a would be rendered nugatory and the Constitution makers could not be held to have contemplated such a possibility at the very inception of the Constitution leaving it to the <ORG> by having recourse to the provision contained in article to remedy such a state of affairs Reliance is placed in support of the above proposition on the following observations of <NAME> in <NAME> Crease The rule is that where a general intention is expressed and the Act expresses also a particular intention incompatible with the general intention the particular intention is to be considered in the nature of an exception To the same effect also are the observations of <NAME> in <NAME> Overseers of Putney quoted at page of the same work It may be laid down as a rule for the construction of statutes that where a special provision and a general provision are inserted which cover the same subjectmatter a case falling within the words of the special provision must be governed thereby and not by the terms of the general provision It therefore follows that the general provision which is enacted in article against the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of inter State trade or commerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the Explanation to article a enabling the delivery State to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of cases covered by the Explanation transactions covered by the Explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions in the course of inter State trade or commerce covered by article and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the State thus acquiring an intraState character so far as the delivery State is concerned Even though these provisions of the Constitution may by analogy support the conclusion that a transaction in the course of inter State trade or commerce is thus lifted out of that category and assimilated to a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the State the analogy must stop there and cannot be worked any further Whereas article provides restrictions on the imposition of taxes on purchase or sale of goods article a gives <ORG> power to impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced This aspect was however not stressed or presented during the course of the arguments and I would prefer not to express any opinion on the scope or meaning of article I would therefore base my construction of the Explanation to article a and article on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which I have referred to above lifting the transaction of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation to article a out of the category of the transactions in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce and assimilating it to a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the delivery <ORG> thus investing it with the character of an intrastate sale qua the delivery <ORG> Such transaction would be a transaction of sale or purchase where as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods are delivered in the delivery <ORG> for the purpose of consumption in that <ORG> i where the transaction is between a dealer in the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passes and a consumer in the delivery <ORG> Save as above I agree with the conclusions reached by my Lord the Chief Justice in the judgment just delivered I agree that the Bombay Sales Tax Act and the rules made thereunder except Rule do not contravene the provisions of article that Rule is clearly severable and can be ignored that there is no substance in the contention of Shri <NAME> that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the Constitution from the purview of taxation by the <ORG>
