Challenge in these appeals by special leave is to the judgments and orders dated th April and st July delivered by <ORG> in No of and Criminal Application No of in No of respectively whereby it has dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellants herein and also declined to extend the status quo order granted by it to them Being aggrieved the appellants filed a writ petition being CRL No of before <ORG> inter alia contending that the notice issued by respondent No was illegal no action could be taken in pursuance thereof and if at all the respondent wanted to take any action it was required to approach the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate under Section of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act for short the Act At this juncture it would be expedient to extract the relevant portions of the said notice Whereas the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Esplanade Mumbai has passed the following order on on the application filed before him by <ORG> Mazda Complex Parsi Agari Lane Thana through its Authorized Officer <NAME> Registrar Mr A Tendolkar <ORG> after issuing notice of taking possession of the secured assets It is manifest from a bare perusal of the said notice that the order passed by the Magistrate dated rd February was referred to by the Assistant Registrar in his notice As afore stated <ORG> rejected the said application filed by the appellants <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants while assailing the impugned orders strenuously urged that apart from the fact that the notice issued by the Assistant Registrar was vague it was never served on the appellants Learned counsel also urged that the notice issued by the Assistant Registrar was vitiated on account of non compliance with Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules for short the Rules as well Per contra Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent <ORG> supporting the impugned judgments contended that in light of the decision of this Court in <ORG> Vs <ORG> no fault could be found with the impugned judgments It was also urged that the appellants having already availed of the remedy of approaching the <ORG> they are estopped from challenging the decision of <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Maharashtra contended that Rule of the Rules was inapplicable in the instant case in as much as it deals with sale of secured assets In support reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in <ORG> <ORG> Section of the Act deals with enforcement of security interest providing that notwithstanding anything contained in Sections or A of the Transfer of Property Act any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the court intervention by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of the Act Section of the Act provides that when a borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor makes any default in repayment of secured debt and his account in respect of such debt is classified as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge his liabilities within sixty days from the date of the notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights given in Section of the Act Section A of the Act was inserted by Act of after the decision of this Court in <ORG> supra and provides for a last opportunity for the borrower to make a representation to the secured creditor against the classification of his account as a non performing asset The secured creditor is required to consider the representation of the borrowers and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that the representation is not tenable or acceptable then he must communicate within one week of the receipt of the communication by the borrower the reasons for rejecting the same Section of the Act provides that if the borrower fails to discharge his liability within the period specified in Section then the secured creditor may take recourse to any of the following actions to recover his debt namely a take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset take over the management of the business of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset Provided that the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale shall be exercised only where the substantial part of the business of the borrower is held as security for the debt Provided further that where the management of whole of the business or part of the business is severable the secured creditor shall take over the management of such business of the borrower which is relatable to the security for the debt appoint any person hereafter referred to as the manager to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor require at any time by notice in writing any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower to pay the secured creditor so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt Section of the Act provides that the secured creditor can file an application before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction the secured asset or other documents relating thereto are found for taking possession thereof If any such request is made the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate as the case may be is obliged to take possession of such asset or document and forward the same to the secured creditor Therefore it follows that a secured creditor may in order to enforce his rights under Section in particular Section a may take recourse to Section of the Act Section of the Act which provides for an appeal to the <ORG> reads as follows Any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of Section taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer under this Chapter may make an application along with such fee as may be prescribed to <ORG> having jurisdiction in the matter within forty five days from the date on which such measures had been taken Provided that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the communication of the reasons to the borrower by the secured creditor for not having accepted his representation or SCC objection or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower shall not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to <ORG> under sub section of Section <ORG> shall consider whether any of the measures referred to in sub section of Section taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security are in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder It is manifest that Rule has no application to the facts of the instant case as contended by the learned counsel for the <ORG> Vs <NAME> the main question which fell for determination was whether the <ORG> would have jurisdiction to consider and adjudicate post Section events or whether its scope in terms of Section of the Act will be confined to the stage contemplated under Section of the Act On an examination of the provisions contained in Chapter III of the Act in particular Sections and this <ORG> held as under SCC In order to prevent misuse of such wide powers and to prevent prejudice being caused to a borrower on account of an error on the part of the banks or financial institutions certain checks and balances have been introduced in Section which allow any person including the borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of Section taken by the secured creditor to make an application to the DRT having jurisdiction in the matter within days from the date of such measures having taken for the reliefs indicated in sub section thereof We are unable to agree with or accept the submissions made on behalf of the appellants that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to interfere with the action taken by the secured creditor after the stage contemplated under Section of the Act It is manifest that an action under Section of the Act constitutes an action taken after the stage of Section and therefore the same would fall within the ambit of Section of the Act Thus the Act itself contemplates an efficacious remedy for the borrower or any person affected by an action under Section of the Act by providing for an appeal before the DRT this Court had observed that The <ORG> while exercising its jurisdiction under Article is duty bound to consider whether a adjudication of writ petition involves any complex and disputed questions of facts and whether they can be satisfactorily resolved the petition reveals all material facts the petitioner has any alternative or effective remedy for the resolution of the dispute SCC SCC SCC SCC person invoking the jurisdiction is guilty of unexplained delay and laches ex facie barred by any laws of limitation grant of relief is against public policy or barred by any valid law and host of other factors Therefore having regard to the facts obtaining in the case <ORG> was fully justified in declining to exercise its jurisdiction under Articles and of the Constitution
