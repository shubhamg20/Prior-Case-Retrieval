and Scope of Reservation of posts under the <ORG> in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Carry forward of unfilled posts for three years validity of HEADNOTE In so far as the initial recruitment and later promotion to classes II III and IV are concerned <ORG> provided for reservation of certain percentage of vacancies for candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Since despite the special provision the intake of these communities into <ORG> continued to be negligible further concessions and relaxations were offered from time to time to members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes In April the percentage of vacancies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was raised from and to and respectively Annexure I In August <ORG> further directed that if the requisite number of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes candidates were not available for being placed on the panel in spite of the various relaxations the best among them i those who secure highest marks should be earmarked for being placed on the panel to the extent vacancies had been reserved in their favour A further modification to the then existing rules was made by Annexure which stated that reservations in posts filled by promotion under the existing scheme would be applicable to all grades or services where the element of direct recruitment if any does not exceed as against as at present It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that Scheduled Castes cannot be a favoured class in the public services because i they are castes and cannot claim preference qua castes unless specially saved by Article which speaks of class and not castes ii that Article could not apply to promotional levels and iii efficiency of administration envisaged by Article had been jeopardised by the impugned circulars which fomented frustration among the civil services and produced inefficiency by placing men of lower efficiency and less experience in higher posts Dismissing the petitions Per majority <NAME> and <NAME> JJ <NAME> concurring in the result with reservation on certain questions There is nothing illegal or unconstitutional in the impugned orders Per <NAME> The argument that since the first petitioner was an unrecognized association the petition is not sustainable must be overruled because whether the petitioners belonged to a recognised union or not the fact remains that a large body of persons with a common grievance exists and they approached this <ORG> under Article Assuming that there is discrimination Article cannot be invoked unless it is predicated that the Scheduled Castes are castes There are sufficient indications in the Constitution to suggest that the Scheduled Castes are not mere castes Article read with Article makes it clear that the exploited lot of the harijan groups in the past shall be extirpated with special care by the <ORG> The positive accent of Article is that the claims of these communities to equalisation of representation in services under the <ORG> shall be taken into consideration Moreover administrative efficiency is secure because there is a direction to give such staff additional training and coaching to bring them upto the standard of others based on the record of his service rendering the promotional prospects unreasonable because this concession is confined to only of the total number of vacancies in a particular grade or post filled in a year and there is no rampant vice of every harijan jumping over the heads of others There is no prospect even if the vacancies are carried forward of sufficient number of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes candidates turning out to fill them Moreover there is a provision that if a sufficient number of candidates from these communities are not found applicants from the unreserved communities would be given appointment provisionally By this rule there is no danger of the total vacancies being gobbled up by the harijan girijan groups virtually obliterating Article There is nothing unreasonable or wrong in Annexure Once the parameters of reservation are within the framework of the fundamental rights minute scrutiny of every administrative measure is not permissible There is no substance in the argument that efficiency of administration would suffer if <ORG> directives were followed in the matter of reservations and promotions In the case of posts which involved safety of movement of trains there was no relaxation of standards in favour of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and they were required to pass the same rigid tests as others A There is no fixed ceiling to reservation or preferential treatment in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes though generally reservation may not be far in excess of about which there is no rigidity Every case must be decided on its own facts There is nothing illegal or unconstitutional in any one of the impugned orders and circulars Article provides that claims of the members of these communities shall be taken into consideration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or a <ORG> In the moral sciences there is no method or procedure which entirely supplants that subjective reason Not only so but I also find that all sorts of most demoniacal and brutal arguments culled from the crude ideas of hereditary transmission and other such gibberish from the western world are brought forward in order to brutalise and tyrannies over the poor all the more Aye <NAME>s if the <NAME> has more aptitude for learning on the ground of heredity than the <NAME> spend no more money on the <NAME> education but spend all on the <NAME> There was <NAME> one of the foremost architects of Free India who stood four square between caste suppression by the upper castes and the socialist egalitarianism implicit in secular democracy We must begin by acknowledging the fact that there is complete absence of two things in Indian society which guarantees equal opportunity for all citizens in matters of <ORG> inherently implies equalisation as a process towards equality but also hastens to harmonize the realistic need to jack up depressed classes to overcome initial handicaps and join the national race towards progress on an equal footing and devotes Art Constitutional questions cannot be viewed in vacuo but must be answered in the social milieu which gives it living meaning While the Indian Railways Act substantially regulates many of the functions of the railway administration in India <ORG> is constituted under the Indian Railway Board Act with a view more effectively to control the administration of railways In the present case ten directives were issued by <ORG> on different occasions which disclosed benign discrimination in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and are challenged by the petitioners as reverse discrimination if we may use that expression popularised in American legalese We see no substance in them The learned Attorney General plea was that in a society of chronic inequality and scarcity of employment actual equality could never be midwifed without birth pangs and discriminatory unconstitutionality could not vitiate programmes meant to achieve real life equality unless we took a pragmatic view The pyramid begins at the base with Class IV posts and rises to the apex by stages through Class III Class II and Class I True to our hierarchical culture pervasive in <ORG> there are further sub divisions consisting of many categories in each class and many grades in each category The agencies for recruitment are <ORG> <ORG> and the top officers authorised by <ORG> in this behalf a by departmental selection based on merit cum seniority and by escalation in the order of seniority from the lower to the higher grade category subject of course to being weeded out if found unfit To understand the functional compulsions purpose orientation and constitutional parameters relevant to such a policy formulation we have to refer to a few articles of the Constitution The claims of the members of the scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of a <ORG> The positive accent of this Article is that the claims of SC ST to equalisation of representation in services under the <ORG> having regard to their sunken social status and impotence in the power system shall be taken into consideration this Court held that an enquiry whether the appellant there belonged to the Dohar caste which was not recognised as a Scheduled Caste and his declaration that he belonged to the Chamar caste which was a Scheduled Caste could not be permitted because of the provisions contained in Article The relevance of this point will be clear when we deal with the legal submissions of counsel Article whether we like it or not ordains that the <ORG> shall with special care promote the interests of the <ORG> Annexure reads Sub Reservation for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in posts filled by promotion in <ORG> There are certain other types of posts on Railways such as Passenger Guides Welfare Inspectors Safety Inspectors Platform Inspectors Publicity Inspectors Vigilance Inspectors etc We will dwell at some length on that ruling later but we may merely mention than an appeal was made to us by counsel for the petitioners that we should reconsider by reference to a larger bench the ratio of <NAME> which has been approvingly referred to for nearly two decades by this Court acted upon by <ORG> throughout and enjoys if we may say so with great respect our full concurrence So it was that we rejected the plea for reconsideration Annexure of August is one such Annexure <ORG> have now revised their policy in regard to reservation and other concessions to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in posts filled by promotion The particular concessions are concretised thus Promotion by selection method i Class II appointments In promotion by selection from Class III to Class II as a measure of improving representation of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes it has now been decided that if they are within the zone of eligibility the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe employees will be given by <ORG> one grading higher than the grading otherwise assignable to them on the basis of their record of service i if any Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe employee has been categorised by the <ORG> on the basis of his record of service as Good he should be recategorised by the <ORG> as Very Good The above concession would be confined to only per cent of the total number of vacancies in a particular grade or post filled in a year The Note takes care to avoid total deprivation of changes for a particular year for general candidates when the vacancies are few NOTE If there are only two vacancies to be filled in a particular year not more than one may be treated as reserved and if there be only one vacancy it should be treated as unreserved Similar provisions though somewhat different in detail were made for posts filled by direct recruitment otherwise than by open competition and the <ORG> directed with disturbing concern for the continued exclusion of <ORG> candidates as follows The matter has been further considered by the Board and it has been decided that if during the selection proceedings it is found that the requisite number of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates are not available for being placed on the panel in spite of the various relaxations already granted the best among them i who secure highest marks should be earmarked for being placed on the panel to the extent vacancies have been reserved in their favour Since this did not ensure fair representation a change was contemplated by Annexure The question of enlarging the scope of the existing scheme of reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the aforesaid cases has been under the consideration of <ORG> for some time past and in partial modification of the instructions contained in the above letters it has now been decided that henceforth the reservations in posts filled by promotion under the existing scheme as indicated above would be applicable to all grades or services where the element of direct recruitment if any does not exceed as against per cent as at present There was reference in it to discontent among supervisors inter alia on account of the procedure of reservation of posts for <ORG> It is true that the Report has a slant against the <ORG> promotion policy notwithstanding the assurance given by <ORG> to the <ORG> that instructions had been issued not to relax standards in favour of <ORG> members where safety was involved We have no hesitation in holding that the narrow concept of cause of action and person aggrieved and individual litigation is becoming obsolescent in some jurisdictions So there is representation of SCs among safaiwalas In Class I services they have representation in Class II in Class III and in Class IV excluding safaiwalas and even among safaiwalas only On the basis of these statistics <ORG> case is that adequacy of representation for SC STs even according to their population forgetting centuries of total exclusion is a long way off The deponent on behalf of <ORG> has explained the position thus I submit that <ORG> in after reviewing the position of intake of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in groups of posts filled by promotion in Railway Services and on the basis of a recommendation made by <ORG> introduced a scheme of training of the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes employees on the jobs of the posts to which they are to be promoted According to this scheme if during selection proceedings it is found that the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes of requisite standards are not available for being placed on the panel the best among them numbering to the extent of reserved vacancies i who secure the highest marks are provided with in service training A further plea is taken that temporary promotions on ad hoc basis are sometimes given to <ORG> members purely for short duration for the purpose of imparting them with in service training on the jobs of the post to which they aspire for promotion Most of the submissions made by counsel for petitioners cannot survive <NAME> and <NAME> supra and our task is simplified by abiding by the propositions laid down therein because these twin rulings bind us being of benches of five and seven judges But care must be taken to see that classification is not pushed to such an extreme point as to make the fundamental right to equality cave in and collapse Article which ensures to all citizens equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment is an incident of guarantee of equality contained in Article Article gives effect to Article Discrimination is the essence of classification Classification is therefore to be founded on substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped together from those left out of the groups and such differential attributes must bear a just and rational relation to the object sought to be achieved There is no denial of equality of opportunity unless the person who complains of discrimination is equally situated with the person or persons who are alleged to have been favoured The test is whether it has a reasonable basis free from artificiality and arbitrariness embracing all and omitting none naturally falling into that category Article enjoins that the claims of the members the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the services and posts in the Union and the States shall be taken into consideration Article of the Constitution states that claims of members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration in the making of appointments to the services and posts in connection with affairs of the <ORG> consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of administration Even assuming that there is discrimination Art As stated earlier there are sufficient indications in the Constitution to suggest that the Scheduled Castes are not mere castes Although he was in a minority on one point in that case that did not detract from the validity or force of the general observations Article lays down the general rule of equality It says that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Though theoretically they are given equal opportunity to run the race in practice the ordinary horse is not given an equal opportunity to compete with the race horse In other words white applicants for admission to <ORG> who may have been turned away because of the reservation of some places for members of disadvantaged minority groups cannot in a case like the one set out above successfully complain the reason being that they do not have a right to equal treatment in the assignment of places but they do have the right to be treated as equals that is with equal respect concern and sympathy in the making of decisions as to which admissions standards should be used But if this condition is satisfied rejected white applicants will fail in their contention that the particular admissions program was unfair and unconstitutional even if they had been effectively excluded from consideration as a result of the adoption of racial criteria in determining the allocation of some of the available places Moreover administrative efficiency is secure because there is a direction to give such staff additional training and coaching to bring them up to the standard of others Of course this concession is confined to only of the total number of vacancies in a particular grade or post filled in a year There is nothing shady about it There is no merit in this objection and no good ground exists which militates against the constitutionality of Annexure Annexure I is also unexceptionable since all that it does is to readjust the proportion of reservation in conformity with the latest <ORG> From the percentage furnished by <ORG> we find that even if we carry forward vacancies for any number of years there is no prospect within the reasonable future of sufficient number of <ORG> ST candidates turning up to fill them There is a provision that if sufficient number of candidates from the <ORG> ST are not found applicants from the unreserved communities will be given the appointment provisionally In order to effectuate the guarantee each year of recruitment will have to be by itself and the representation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities does not mean that the provision made by the <ORG> should have the effect of virtually obliterating the rest of the Article particularly clauses and thereof Once the fundamental premises are accepted there is nothing unreasonable or wrong in Annexures and to Annexure It is significant that with a view to prevent total exclusion of others there is a provision that if there are only two vacancies in a given year in more than one may be treated as reserved and if there is only one vacancy it should be treated as unreserved There is no force in this submission for reservation in favour of the panchama proletariat there is nothing to strike down in Annexure As between the socially even economically depressed and the economically backward the Constitution has emphatically cast its preference for the former There is a human problem behind these writ petitions which we clearly appreciate So long as this scarcity persists and power goes with office the jaundiced politics of snatching the jobs going initially or at promotion level by hook or crook is the only development that takes place whatever the National Plans proclaim a Directive Principle of <ORG> Policy proclaims the principle that the <ORG> shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation The equality of opportunity guaranteed to all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> will not restrain the <ORG> from making such reservation It enables a backward class of citizens by the process of reservation in <ORG> service to move along the road to ultimate equality with the more advanced classes It provides that the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or a <ORG> but and this is imperative such consideration must be consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of administration The carry forward rule was held constitutionally invalid on the basis that for the purpose of Art In order to effectuate the guarantee each year of recruitment will have to be considered by itself and the reservation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities It seems to me that apart from the impact that an excessive reservation in a particular year is bound to have on the general community of citizens there is the further far reaching significance this assumes in the context of Art It has been urged by the respondents that <NAME>n supra is A no longer good law in view of the Judge decision in State of Kerala <NAME> It does appear from some of the individual Judgments delivered in the latter case that although <NAME> supra has not been expressly overruled by a majority of the Bench there are observations by the majority of Judges which throw doubt on the validity of the principle enunciated by it and ultimately the Court has upheld the promotion of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates among the total promotion of candidates It would seem then that there is an apparent conflict between <NAME> supra and <NAME> supra As the position is not clear and in any event as my learned brothers have taken a definite view in favour of the carry forward rule I have confined myself to expressing these observations Though respect for my brother would ordinarily prevent me from venturing to write a separate opinion specially when I agree whole heatedly with his conclusions and the route traversed by him I propose to make in this case certain general observations because I expect the same questions to be raised repeatedly in different situations and in different forms and it is just as well that I project my own prosaic and pedestrian point of view without going into the detail or depth already explored by my brother which is included in part XVI of the Constitution dealing with special provisions relating to certain classes expressly provides The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs to the <ORG> or of a State and which guarantee equality of opportunity in matters of public employment read as follows There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represent in the services under the <ORG> Art It follows that it becomes the duty of the <ORG> to apply the Directive Principles in interpreting the Constitution and the laws guarantees equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> It recognises that the right to equality of opportunity includes the right of the underprivileged to conditions comparable to or compensatory of those enjoyed by the privileged The question was whether a certain rule which gave a longer period of exemption to members belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes than to others from passing certain departmental tests in order to be eligible for promotion from the Post of Lower Division Clerk to that of <ORG> Clerk was not violative of Art If preference shall be given to a particular under represented community other than a backward class or under represented State in <ORG> such a rule will contravene Article A similar rule giving preference to an under represented backward community is valid and will not contravene articles and The classification of employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for allowing them an extended period of two years for passing the special tests for promotion is a just and reasonable classification having rational nexus to the object of providing equal opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to public office xx xx xx Article of the Constitution states that claims of members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration in the making of appointments to the services and posts in connection with affairs of the <ORG> consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of administration <NAME> and <NAME> in their separate concurring opinions but I do not propose to extract them in the interest of space <NAME> observed at There is no basis for the contention that the reservation made for backward classes is excessive a rule reserving the first out of every ten vacancies to a member of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and providing for carry forward of the vacancy if suitable candidate was not available was struck down by <ORG> by visualising various hypothetical cases which could lead to anomalous situations in which a person getting the benefit of reservation may jump over the heads of several of his seniors not only in his own grade but even in higher grades The reservation must be only for the purpose of giving adequate representation in the service to the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes xx xx xx xx There was no material before <ORG> and there is no material before us from which we can conclude that the impugned order is violative of Art Neither the Reservation rule nor the carry forward for three years rule has resulted in any such disastrous consequences In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> it has been pointed out that minimum standards arc insisted upon for every appointment and in the case of candidates wanting in requisite standards those with the highest marks are given special intensive training to enable them to come up to the requisite standards In the case of posts which involve the safety of movement of trains there is no relaxation of standards in favour of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and they are required to pass the same rigid tests as other candidates There is no fixed ceiling to reservation or preferential treatment in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes though generally reservation may not be far in excess of fifty percent Every case must be decided with reference to the present practical results yielded by the application of the particular rule of preferential treatment and not with reference to hypothetical results which the application of the rule may yield in the future Each order and circular has been individually discussed by my brother <NAME> with whose reasoning and conclusions I agree and to which I wish to add no more
