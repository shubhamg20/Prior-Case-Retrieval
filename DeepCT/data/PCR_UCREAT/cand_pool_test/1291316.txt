Sales Tax Inter <ORG> sales Sale outside <ORG> but goods delivered for consumption within <ORG> Competence of <ORG>s to levy tax Conditional legislation Power of <ORG> to authorise such taxation President Adaptation Order Scope of Nature of Retrospective operation Enactment unconstitutional in Part Effect Madras General Sales Tax Act Mad Thereupon they filed the present petitions under Art But before final orders were passed on the petitions <ORG> passed Sales Tax Laws Validation Act whereof provided that no law of a <ORG> imposing or authorising the imposition of tax on inter <ORG> sales during the period between April and September shall be deeme to be invalid or ever to have been invalid merely by reason of the fact that the sales took place in the course of the inter <ORG> trade That section further provided that taxes levied or collected on such sales during the aforesaid period shall be deemed to have been validly levied or collected It was the con tention of the <ORG> of Andhra that by reason of the aforesaid provision it had the right to impose tax on inter <ORG> sales during the aforesaid period On the other hand the petitioners contended inter alia that I Of the Madras General Sales Tax Laws Validation Act which gave validity to laws which imposed a tax did not authorise the imposition the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act was ultra vires Art It was also contended that under the Constitution it was only the <ORG> that has the competence to impose tax on inter <ORG> sales and that the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act was bad in that it gave validity to the laws of the <ORG> to impose the tax Held <NAME> dissenting that of the Madras General Sales Tax Act did in fact impose a tax on the class of sales covered by the Explanation to Art a of the Constitution in <ORG> case that it merely prohibited the outside <ORG>s from imposing a tax on the class of sales falling within the Explanation and did not confer on the delivery <ORG> any power to impose a tax on such sales has no application to a taxing statute of a <ORG> the object of which was primarily to confer power on the <ORG> to levy and collect tax of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act validates not only the levies already collected but also authorises the imposition of tax on sales falling within the Explanation which had taken place during the period specified in The Act is not a temporary Act though its operation is limited to sales taking place within a specified period Under Entry List taxes on sale of goods is within the exclusive competence of the <ORG> Legislature and reading the two Entries together Entry must be construed as excluding the power to tax sale of goods Entry List must therefore be construed as not including the power to impose tax on inter <ORG> sales The words for the purposes of clause a i have the same meaning in the Explanation in Art Section does not enlarge the definition of sales it only restricts the power of the <ORG> to tax The validation being for a temporary period which expired on September no action can be taken after that date under the validated laws There are no sales in Andhra all sales being in Madras indicates that the lifting of the ban is a condition precedent to legislation by the <ORG>s imposing tax on inter <ORG> sales Alternatively the power to tax inter <ORG> sales is with <ORG> under Entry of List I of Schedule VII of the Constitution The same interpretation must be given to the explanation to as has been given to the explanation to Art <NAME> case supports this contention according to the decision in the <ORG> case there was no levy on inter<ORG> sales and there was nothing for <ORG> to lift the ban for There is a vital difference between retrospective and retroactive operation There is no power in <ORG> to validate ex post facto a violation of Art he exercises a power which belongs to the President and not a power on behalf of the <ORG> is only in respect of existing laws there is no power in the <ORG>s to enact laws imposing tax on interstate sales The power to impose tax on inter <ORG> sales is within the exclusive domain of <ORG> under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and Entry of List must be construed as not including such power Legislative power generally includes the power to legislate retrospectively There is no limitation in Art In construing of the Andhra Madras Act regard must be had to the law as it stood till September when judgment was delivered in the <ORG> case The law of a State which imposed tax on Explanation sales would remain on the statute book in spite of the decision in The <ORG> case but could not be enforced VENKATARAMA AIYAR The petitioners are dealers carrying on business in the City of Madras in the sale and purchase of yarn and they have filed the present applications under Art of the Constitution for the issue of a writ of prohibition or other appropriate writ restraining the State of Andhra from taking proceedings for imposing tax on certain sales effected by them in favour of merchants who are residing or carrying on business in what is now the State of Andhra Pradesh on the ground inter alia that the said sales were made in the course of inter State trade and that no tax could be levied on them by reason of the prohibition contained in Art Counsel for the petitioners however concedes that the dispute in these proceedings is confined to the proposed imposition of tax in so far as it relates to sales of the character mentioned in the Explanation to Art On September <ORG> enacted the Andhra State Act of whereby a separate State called the State of Andhra was constituted incorporating therein territories which had previously thereto formed part of the State of Madras and this Act came into force on October Section of the Andhra State Act conferred on the Government a power to adapt laws for the purpose of facilitating the application of any law previously made and in exercise of the power conferred by this section an Adaptation Order was passed on November whereby the word Andhra was substituted for the word Madras in the Madras Act Section i defines turnover as the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought by or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration Section is the charging section and provides that every dealer shall pay for each year tax on his total turnover for such year By the Madras General Sales Tax Amendment Act No of a new Explanation was added to the definition of sale and it is as follows Explanation Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act the sale or purchase of any goods shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have taken place in this Province wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made a if the goods were actually in this Province at the time when the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made or in case the contract was for the sale or purchase of future goods by description then if the goods are actually produced in this Province at any time after the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made This amendment came into force on January It was also observed that after the amendment came into force a tax on a sale which came within Explanation would be valid No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the State or in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India For the purposes of Sub clause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State Except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase take place in the course of interstate trade or commerce Provided that the President may by order direct that any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall notwithstanding that the imposition of sucli tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause continue to be levied until the thirty first day of March No law made by <ORG> State imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent In exercise of the power conferred by this provision the President made Adaptation Orders with reference to the Sales Tax Laws of all the States and as regards the Madras Act he issued on July the Fourth Amendment inserting a new section in that Act It runs as follows Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place a i outside the State of Madras or ii in the course of import of the goods into the territory of India or of the export of the goods out of such territory or except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide after the st March in the course of inter State trade or commerce and the provisions of this Act shall be read and construed accordingly Explanation For the purposes of cl a i a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State Therein it was held by a majority that though the sales falling within the Explanation would in fact be in the course of interState trade they became by reason of the fiction introduced therein invested with the character of intra State sales and would be liable to be taxed by the State within which the goods were delivered for consumption <NAME> notification on July calling upon dealers to submit returns of their turnover of sales in which goods were delivered in the Andhra State for consumption and a copy thereof was sent to <ORG> of which the petitioners are members The Association disputed the liability of the Madras dealers to pay any tax in respect of the sales to the Andhra dealers and after some correspondence the Andhra State finally issued on June notices to the petitioners to send their returns of turnover by July failing which it was stated that assessments would be made on the best judgment basis and that further the dealers would be liable to the penalties prescribed by the law Vide Annexure to the petition Before final orders were passed on the petitions however the Sales Tax Validation Ordinance No III of was promulgated on January and that was later replaced by the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act and that came into force on March Section of this Act runs as follows Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court no law of a <ORG> imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce during the period between the st day of April and the th day of September shall be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been invalid merely by reason of the fact that such sale or purchase took place in the course of interstate trade or commerce and all such taxes levied or collected or purporting to have been levied or collected during the aforesaid period shall be deemed always to have been validly levied or collected in accordance with law On February the Andhra State which had become the State of Andhra Pradesh under of the States Reorganisation Act filed a fresh statement that by reason of the Validation Act the State was entitled to impose a tax on the Explanation sales which had taken place during the period between the st day of April and the th day of September which will hereinafter be referred to as the specified period and that the petitions should therefore be dismissed The petitioners challenge the correctness of this position They contend that the Andhra Madras Act does not in fact impose a tax oh the Explanation sales and that in consequence the Validation Act can have no effect on it that the Validation Act is itself unconstitutional and void that the Act even if valid does not validate of the Andhra Madras Act that it validates only levies and collections of tax already made and does not authorise the initiation of fresh proceedings for assessment of tax or for realisa tion of the same that even if the Act authorised fresh imposition of taxes that could not be done without further legislation pursuant thereto by the State and that no action could be taken on the basis of of the Andhra Madras Act as being unconstitutional when enacted it was for all purposes non est that tax on the sale of yarn could under the Act be levied only at a single point and the State of Madras having imposed a tax on the sale of goods now proposed to be taxed the Andhra State could not impose a tax once again on the sale of the self same goods and that further the tax on yarn would so far as the Andhra State is concerned be bad as being hit by the Essential Commodities Act read with Art As any decision by this Court on the questions raised in the petitions must conclude similar questions under the laws of other States those States applied for and obtained permission to intervene in these proceedings and we have heard the Advocates General of Madras Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on the questions As the main point for determination is the vires of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act which will hereinafter be referred to as the impugned Act <ORG> has intervened and the learned Solicitor General has addressed us on the questions relating to the validity of that Act Counsel for <ORG> raised a further contention different from and inconsistent with the position taken by the petitioners and other inter veners and that is that under Entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution inter State trade and commerce is the exclusive domain of <ORG> that tax on inter State sales is comprised therein that the <ORG> have accordingly no power to tax such sales and that <ORG> is not competent to authorise them to impose such a tax and that accordingly the impugned Act is wholly misconceived and inoperative On these contentions the questions that arise for our determination are I Whether the Andhra Madras Act in fact imposes a tax on the class of sales falling within the Explanation to Art Only if it does that would the further questions as to the vires and the operation of the impugned Act arise for consideration It must therefore be taken that under the Act as it stood prior to the Constitution the State of Madras had no power to impose a tax on sales of the kind mentioned in the Explanation to Art of the Constitution was merely to impose restrictions on the power which the <ORG>s had under Entry in List to enact laws imposing tax on sales and that in that context the true scope of the Explanation to Art <NAME> tax a sale in which the property passed inside it if the goods were actually delivered under the sale for consumption in another State and not to confer on the delivery State a power to tax such a sale and that the Explanation in which is word for word a reproduction of the Explanation to Art Reliance is placed in support of this contention on the following observations of this Court in <ORG> case at In clause a the Constitution makers have placed a ban on the taxing power of the States with respect to sales or purchases which take place outside the State Does a sale or purchase take place at the place where the contract of sale is made or where the property in the goods passes or where the goods are delivered These questions are answered by the Explanation By saying that a Parti cular sale or purchase is to be deemed to take in a particular State the Explanation only indicates that such sale or purchase has taken place outside all other States a the Explanation to of the Andhra Madras Act must be interpreted as prohibiting States other than Andhra from taxing sales under which goods are delivered for consumption outside those States even though property passed inside them and not as authorising the State of Andhra to tax sales in which goods are delivered therein for consumption even though property in the goods passed outside that State The effect of this it is said is to impose a restriction on the power which the State previously possessed of taxing sales coming within the definition in and not to enlarge it <NAME> Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act <ORG> had the exclusive competence to enact a law imposing a tax on the sale of goods and under such a law could be made for the Province or for any part thereof <ORG> had under Entry in List I of the Government of India Act power to enact laws imposing tax on income other than agricultural income and under the law could be made for the whole of British India or for any part thereof It was held by <ORG> that the requirements of were satisfied if there was sufficient territorial connection between the <ORG> imposing the tax and the person who was sought to be taxed and the receipt of income by the assessees in British India furnished sufficient nexus to give validity to the legislation imposing tax on their foreign income If this doctrine of nexus is applicable to laws imposing tax on sales and it was applied by this Court to those laws in the <ORG> case at and in <NAME> case at pp <NAME> retaining the power in the <ORG>s to tax sales under Entry in List II sought to impose certain restrictions on that power in Art These considerations will clearly be in apposite in construing a taxing statute like the Madras Act the object of which is primarily to confer power on the <ORG> to levy and collect tax When we find in such a statute a provision containing a prohibition followed by an Explanation which is positive in its terms the true interpretation to be put on it is that while the prohibition is intended to prevent taxation of outside sales on the basis of the nexus doctrine the Explanation is intended to authorise taxation of sales falling within its purview subject of course to the other provisions of the Constitution such as Art That being the position what purpose would the Explanation serve in of the Madras Act if it merely meant that when goods are delivered under a contract of sale for consumption in the <ORG> of Madras the outside <ORG> in which property in the goods passes has no power to tax the sale That is not the concern of the <ORG> of Madras and indeed <ORG> would be incompetent to enact such a law Now as the Explanation lays down in clear and unambiguous terms that the sales of the character mentioned therein are to be deemed to have taken place inside the <ORG> in which goods are delivered for consumption full effect must be given to it and its operation cannot be cut down by reference to the non obstante clause According to the definition in a sale in which property passes inside the <ORG> of Madras will be liable to be taxed even though the goods are delivered for consumption outside that <ORG> but under the Explanation such a sale will be deemed to have taken place in the out side <ORG> in which goods are delivered for consumption and therefore the <ORG> of Madras will have nO power to tax it The purpose which the non obstante clause serves is to render the Explanation effective against the definition in and not to render it ineffective in its own sphere as determined on its terms The Explanation in it is argued cannot override and if its object was to confer on the <ORG> a power to tax sales falling within its ambit that has not in fact been achieved Now a contention that what the <ORG> intended to bring about it has failed to do by reason of defective draftsmanship is one which can only be accepted in the last resort when there is no avenue left for escape from that conclusion If the provisions of are effective for the purpose of limiting the operation of we do not see any difficulty in construing the Explanation therein as equally effective for the purpose of enlarging it Again it is a rule of construction well establisbed that the several sections forming part of a statute should be read unless there are compelling reasons contra as constituting a single scheme and construed in such manner as would give effect to all of them On this principle and must be read together as defining what are sales which are taxable under the Act and what are not and so read the Explanation really means that in sales in which goods are delivered for consumption in the State of Madras the property therein shall be deemed to have passed inside that State notwithstanding that it has under the Sale of Goods Act passed outside that State and that having regard to the interpretation put on that Article in The Bengal Immunity Company case the Explanation in would be valid in so far as it prohibits the State of Madras from imposing a tax on sales in which goods are delivered outside Madras though property therein passed inside that State but that in so far as it makes taxable sales in which property passes outside the State of Madras but the goods themselves are delivered for consumption in Madras it is much more than bringing the It is argued that such a provision could be enacted by <ORG> as was in fact done by the legis latures of many of the States but the President could not do it in exercise of the special and limited power conferred on him by Art such as sales in which goods are delivered for consumption outside Madras and leave it there and not to add to it taxing of sales in which goods are delivered for consumption in the State of Madras if its language is comprehensive and wide enough to include such sales If in enacting the Explanation the Adaptation Order merely intended to prohibit the <ORG> of Madras from imposing tax on sales under which goods are delivered for consumption outside that <ORG> even though property therein passed inside that <ORG> it would clearly have expressed that intention in words to the following effect For the purposes of clause a i a sale under which goods are delivered for consumption outside the <ORG> of Madras shall be deemed to have taken place outside that <ORG> notwithstanding that property in those goods passed inside that <ORG> an inter <ORG> character in the <ORG> in which goods are actually delivered for consumption a are as already stated without force in their application to a taxing statute we must give full effect to the words of the enactment and bold that they operate to confer on the <ORG> a power to tax Explanation sales There is one other contention relating to this aspect of the matter which remains to be considered and that is that even if the Explanation could be construed as authorising the imposition of a tax on the sales mentioned therein a reading of the section as a whole makes it clear that in fact no such tax was imposed as it expressly enacts that Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to impose a tax on inter <ORG> sales Article consists of two parts one imposing a restriction on the power possessed by the <ORG>s to tax sales under Entry in so far as such sales are in the course of inter <ORG> trade and commerce and another vesting in <ORG> a power to enact a law removing that restriction Taken along with the admitted power of the <ORG>s to impose tax on sales under Entry the true scope of is that it does impose a tax on the Explanation sales but the imposition is to take effect only when <ORG> lifts the ban In other words it is a piece of legislation imposing tax in praesenti but with a condition annexed that it is to come into force in futuro as and when <ORG> so provides In The Queen <NAME> it was held by <ORG> that a legislature acting within the ambit of authority conferred on it by the Constitution has the power to enact a law either absolutely or conditionally and that position has been repeatedly affirmed in this Court It could have no immediate operation by reason of the bar imposed by Art but when once that is removed by a law of <ORG> there is no impediment to its being enforced That satisfies all the requirements of a conditional legislation But it was argued that of the Madras Act could not be so construed because it was not open to the President acting in exercise of the power conferred on him under Art We see no force in this argument It is also contended that under the Sales Tax Act the levy of tax is annual and the rules contemplate submission of quarterly returns and payment of taxes every quarter on the admitted turnover and that a conditional legislation under which payment of tax will become enforceable in futuro would be inconsistent with the scheme of the Act and the rules That the States will have to frame rules for realizing the tax which becomes now payable is not a ground for holding that there is in fact no imposition of tax <NAME> We have so far considered the question on principle and on the language of the statute It was held that the Explanation to had the effect of rendering the sale one inside the State so as to fall within the definition of that word in and that it was taxable Next in point of time is the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> in which the question arose with reference to of the Bombay Sales Tax Act Bom In this view the contention urged on behalf of the <ORG>s that the Explanation to Art That brings us on to the next question which is whether the impugned Act Sales Tax Laws Validation Act is ultra vires on the ground that it is not authorised by the terms of Art a which came into force on January The position on September was that the States had imposed and collected large amounts by way of tax on Explanation sales that there were proceedings pending for assessment of tax on such sales and that apart from this the States would have been entitled to take but for the decision in The Bengal Immunity Company case proceedings for the assessment of tax in respect of those sales These were the evils which called for redress and it was to remedy them that <ORG> enacted the Sales Tax Validation Ordinance No III of and eventually replaced it by the impugned Act Section of the Act provides that no law of a <ORG> imposing a tax on sales which took place in the course of inter<ORG> trade or commerce between April and September shall be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been invalid merely by reason of the fact that such sales were in the course of inter <ORG> trade The section further provides that all taxes levied or collected under such a law during the specified period shall be deemed to have been validly levied or collected The policy behind the Act is obviously to declare the law as interpreted in The United Motors case as the law governing sales filling within the Explanation up to the date of the judgment in The Bengal Immunity Company case and to give effect to the law as laid down in that decision for the sales effected subsequent thereto It is firstly contended by them that under Entry in List II the power to make laws in respect of tax on sales is vested exclusively in the <ORG>s that the power which is conferred on <ORG> under Art It is argued that to validate is to confirm or ratify and that can be only in respect of acts which one could have himself performed and that if <ORG> cannot enact a law relating to sales tax it cannot validate such a law either and that such a law is accordingly unauthorised and void But the true nature of a law has to be determined not on the label given to it in the statute but on its substance It is next contended that the impugned Act is wholly retrospective in character in that it operates on sales which took place during the specified period and that such a legislation is having regard to the intendment of Art It is argued that this Article to start with enacts a restriction on the power of the <ORG> to impose taxes on inter <ORG> sales and then vests in <ORG> a power <NAME> to remove that restriction and that in logical sequence therefore there should first be a legislation by <ORG> authorising the <ORG>s to impose a tax on inter<ORG> sales and then a law of the <ORG> made in accordance therewith and that that order having been reversed in the present case the impugned Act is unconstitutional We do not agree with this contention It places no restrictions on the nature of the law to be passed by <ORG> What is material to observe is that the power conferred on <ORG> under Art is a legislative power and such a power conferred on <ORG> carries with it authority to enact a law either prospectively or retrospectively unless there can be found in the Constitution itself a limitation on that power Now there is nothing express in Art imposing a restriction on the power of <ORG> to enact a law with retrospective operation But it is argued for the petitioners that such a restriction is to be implied from the scheme of it which is that there is a prohibition on the power of the <ORG> to enact a law imposing tax on inter <ORG> sales unless <ORG> lifts the ban and it is said that a prohibition operates only in futuro and therefore a law removing that prohibition must also operate in futuro There the question arose with reference to the validity of a mortgage of agricultural lands in the Punjab executed in the year Section A of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act which came into force in enacted that transfer of a land by a member of an agricultural tribe in favour of another member of the tribe was void if the transferee was a benamidar for a person who was not a member of that tribe whether such transfer was I A The mortgagee instituted a suit challenging the vires of this section on the ground that it contravened of the Government of India Act which provided that no subject of His Majesty domiciled in India shall be prohibited from acquiring holding or disposing of property on grounds only of religion place of birth or descent The mortgagor in reply relied on which enacted that nothing in that section shall affect the operation of any law which prohibits the sale or mortgage of agricultural land situate in any particular area and owned by a person belonging to the agriculturist class In rejecting this contention <ORG> observed that what was saved by was a law prohibiting certain kinds of transfers that the word prohibition could properly apply only to acts to be done in futuro and that the impugned provision A was intra vires the Constitutional provision in so far as it prohibited transfers after the date of its enactment but to the extent that it avoided transfers which had taken place prior to that date it was ultra vires While a law prohibiting transfers must be prospective a law authorising imposition of tax need not be <NAME> Government of India Act but subject to the other provisions of this Act all the law in force in British India immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act shall continue in force in British India until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority It was held that the power of a legislature to pass a law included a power to pass it retrospectively and that the words of did not operate to impose any restriction on that power and that the legislation was intra vires It is next contended that the impugned Act is ultra vires inasmuch as it is much more than a mere retrospective law and that it is really a piece of ex post facto legislation which is not authorised by Art The argument in support of this contention may thus be stated A State legislature is competent under Entry in List II to enact a law taxing sale of goods and when such a law is made to operate retrospectively it may not be open to challenge on constitutional grounds though its propriety may be open to question on grounds of policy <ORG> has no competence to enact laws in respect of tax on sales filling within Entry in List but Art confers on it a power to authorise the States to impose a tax on inter State sales Such a general law may be intra vires the States but not <ORG> nor is it one which can be justified by the power granted to it to provide otherwise It is also argued that even if the power to make a law conferred on <ORG> under Art comprehends a power to enact a law with retrospective operation that power cannot extend to authorising what is unconstitutional and that as of the Madras Act and the corresponding provisions in the statutes of other States were unconstitutional and illegal when made as contravening the prohibition enacted in Art If it is competent to the legislatures of the States to enact a law imposing a tax on inter State sales to take effect when <ORG> so provides there is nothing unconstitutional or illegal either in of the Madras Act or in the corresponding provisions in the Acts of other States We have now to consider the contention that even if the impugned Act is valid that would not give efficacy to of the Madras Act or the corresponding provisions in the laws of other States which came in by adaptation under Art has a technical import and means a law which is enacted by the legislature of a State in the manner prescribed by the Constitution and open to challenge in courts if it is unconstitutional that that expression occurring in of the impugned Act must bear the same meaning which it has in Art as it was enacted pursuant to the authority contained therein and that of the Madras Act is not a law of that description as it was made by the President in exercise of the special power conferred on him by Art the Governor is authorised subject to the conditions laid down therein to issue Ordinances which have the force of law and these Ordinances are clearly laws of the <ORG> and not the less so by reason of their not having been passed by the <ORG> legislature is not open to attack on the ground that it contravenes some constitutional provision preclude an attack on the Adaptation Order only on the ground that it does more than merely bringing the State law into conformity with the Constitution and is in consequence ultra vires the powers conferred by that article It is contended that though of the impugned Act consists of two clauses one giving effect to laws of States imposing tax on inter State sales in so far as they took place during the specified period and the other validating levy or collection of tax made during that period the first clause has no independent operation the only purpose which it serves being to lead up to the second which is the only effective clause in the section It is argued that if the intention of the legislature was not merely to validate the levies or collections already made but also to maintain the laws in force so as to enable the States to take fresh proceedings for assessment and levy of tax then there was no need whatsoever for the second clause as effectuation of the Act would automatically validate the levies and collections made thereunder It is said that the object of the legislation was only to see that the States had not to refund amounts collected by them and that for achieving that object it was necessary only to give effect to the second clause On the contention of the petitioners the first clause has to be discarded as wholly inoperative and we should be th to adopt a construction which leads to that result But it is to be noted that the first clause has reference to the exercise of legislative power while the second is concerned with administrative action and it is possible that the second clause might have been enacted by way of abundant caution It is nothing strange or unusual for a legislature to insert a provision ex abundanti cautela so as to disarm possible objection but it is in conceivable that it should enact a provision which is wholly inoperative But even from that point of view there was the fact that there were dealers who had collected taxes from their purchasers for payment to the <ORG> but were relieved of A I Bom tion and that the laws of the States are kept in force in respect of sales which had taken place during the specified period and that proceedings in respect thereof for assessment are within the protection of the Act It is a permanent statute operating on all sales which took place during the specified period IV It is next contended that even if the impugned Act authorised starting of fresh proceedings for assessment of tax on the Explanation sales which had taken place during the specified period no action in that behalf could be taken under of the It would be sufficient answer to this contention that of the Madras Act is only a piece of conditional legislation imposing tax on interState sales when <ORG> should enact a law lifting the ban and if such legislation is competent as we have held it is then no question of unconstitutionality of the section when it was enacted could arise In a Federal Constitution where legislative powers are distributed between different bodies the competence of the legislature to enact a particular law must depend upon whether the topic of that legislation has been assigned by the Constitution Act to that legislature But if the law is in respect of a matter assigned to the legislature but its provisions disregard constitutional prohibitions though the law would be unen This was bad in so far as it related to sales in the course of interstate trade as it was in contravention of the Commerce Clause But in the <ORG> passed a law conferring authority on the States to enact prohibition laws That Act in terms removed the obstacle and we perceive no adequate ground for adjudging that a re enactment of the state law was required before it could have the effect upon imported which it had always had upon domestic property There construing of the Act of which enacts that any law made in contravention of the restrictions imposed by this sub section shall so far as it contravenes these restrictions be void Lord <NAME> observed I am not aware of any authority for the view that language such as this necessarily means that contravention must produce an actual gap in the statute book in the sense that the measure concerned or some specific part thereof simply drops out of the authorized text As well as this vertical severability if I may so describe it I see no reason why if the circumstances warrant such a course the terms of section should not be sufficiently met by what I may call a horizontal severance a severance that is which without excising any of the text removes from its ambit some particular subject matter activity or application This I think would give effect to the words so far as it contravenes without impinging on the meaning or weight to be attached to the word void In the course of the judgment <NAME> made the following observations which are relied on by the petitioners The constitutional invalidity of a part of section of the Bombay Prohibition Act having been declared by this Court that part of the section ceased to have any legal effect in judging cases of citizens arid had to be regarded as null and void in determining whether a citizen was guilty of an offence There was no question of the lifting of ban imposed by Art and the question as to the effect of lifting of a ban did not arise for decision Where the sales were of cocoanut oil there was a provision for deduction of the price paid for the purchase of copra from the total turnover and consequent thereon the sales which took place outside the State were excluded from the turnover <NAME> a question arose as to the quantum of deduction to which the assessee was entitled in respect of his purchase of copra This contention was rejected by <ORG> which limited the deduction to purchase of copra relating to the sales inside the State and in affirming that decision this Court observed In our opinion section of the Act in cases falling within the categories specified under Article of the Constitution has the effect of setting at nought and of obliterating in regard thereto the provisions contained in the Act relating to the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of such goods and in particular the provisions contained in the charging section and the provisions contained in rule and other provisions which are incidental to the process of levying such tax on the transactions which came within its purview There the question arose with reference These provisions though valid at the time when they were enacted became void on the coming into force of the Constitution as infringing the rights of citizens to carry on business protected by Art The contention was that as of the Act of had become void at the date of the Constitution a notification issued by the <ORG> under that section after the date of the amendment of the Consti tution was not valid as it must be taken to have become non est It was held by this Court that of the Act of could not be held to have been effaced out of the statute book because it continued to operate on transactions prior to the coming into force of the Constitution and that even after the Constitution it would be operative as against non citizens that the consequence of being repugnant to Art The result of the authorities may thus be summed up Where an enactment is unconstitutional in part but valid as to the rest assuming of course that the two portions are severable it cannot be held to have been wiped out of the statute book as it admittedly must remain there for the purpose of enforcement of the valid portion thereof and being on the statute book even that portion which is unenforceable on the ground that it is unconstitutional will operate proprio vigore when the Constitutional bar is removed and there is no need for a fresh legislation to give effect thereto It also authorises the imposition of tax on the sales in which the property in the goods passes outside Madras but goods are delivered for consumption within Madras The fact that it is invalid as to a part has not the effect of obliterating it out of the statute book because it is valid as to a part and has to remain in the statute book for being enforced as to that part In this view we do not feel called upon to express any opinion as to whether it would make any difference in the result if the impugned provision was unconstitutional in its entirety There is one other aspect of the question to which reference must be made In the context in which they occur the true meaning to be given to these words is as already observed that no law of a State shall be effective to impose a tax that is to say the law cannot be enforced in so far as it imposes such a tax Whether we consider the question on broad principles as to the effect of un constitutionality of a statute or on the language of Art and the bar under that Article having been now removed there is no legal impediment to effect being given to them We shall now deal with the contention of the learned counsel for <ORG> who struck a new path cutting across the lines on which the petitioners and the other interveners proceeded He contended that the decisive factor in the determination of the question was Entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule Inter State trade and commerce that under that Entry <ORG> had the exclusive power to enact laws in respect of inter State trade and commerce and that included power to impose a tax on inter State sales that the States had therefore no competence under the Constitution to enact a law imposing tax on such sales that the laws passed by the States after the Constitution imposing such a tax were ultra vires and void that the impugned Act purporting to give effect to such laws was likewise ultra vires and inoperative and that in consequence the proceedings sought to be taken under of the Madras Act and the corresponding provisions in the sister Acts of other States were unauthorised and illegal that The Congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several States and that has been interpreted by <ORG> of the United States as meaning that the States have no power to enact a law imposing a tax on the carrying on of inter State trade <NAME> Taxing District of Shelby County or imposing tax on inter State sales <NAME> <ORG> the States have not the power to impose tax on inter State sales is made in respect of the imposition of tax on goods imported from other States inter State sales and in consequence of the Madras Act which came into force after the Constitution would if it is construed as imposing a tax be bad and the impugned Act which proceeds on the view that the States have the power to enact laws imposing a tax on inter State sales and seeks to give effect to them would also be unconstitutional and void In the Government of India Act there was no Entry corresponding to Entry in List I of the Constitu tion But there was in List II Entry which corresponds to Entry in the Constitution It is not in dispute that under Entry the States had power to pass a law imposing a tax on inter State sales because the terms of the Entry are wide and would include inter State as well as intrastate sales Then the Constitu tion came into force and it included for the first time a new Entry in List Having regard to the connotation of that Entry in the Government of India Act one would have expected that if it was intended by the Constitution makers that the States should be deprived of the power to tax interstate sales which they had under Entry in the Government of India Act that would have been made clear in the Entry itself Construing Entry in the light of the above scheme it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the power of <ORG> to legislate on inter State trade and commerce under Entry does not include a power to impose a tax on sales in the course of such trade and commerce Article has a direct bearing on the point now under discussion It imposes various restrictions on the power of the <ORG> to enact laws imposing taxes on sale of goods and one of those restrictions has reference to taxes on inter <ORG> sales vide Art It is implicit in this provision that it is the <ORG>s that have got the power to impose a tax on such sales as there can be no question of a restriction on what does not exist It was observed therein that under Entry as under Entry of the Government of India Act the power to tax sales rested with the <ORG>s and that Art was enacted with the object of avoiding multiple taxation of inter <ORG> sales in exercise of the power conferred by that Entry This again strongly supports the conclusion that Entry must be interpreted as including the power to tax inter <ORG> sales and Entry as excluding it had reference only to laws which were in existence at the time when the Constitution came into force and that the power given to <ORG> was one to continue those laws and there it clearly has reference to laws to be enacted after the Constitution To sum up Entry is successor to Entry in the Government of India Act and it would be legitimate to construe it as including tax on inter<ORG> sales unless there is anything repugnant to it in the Constitution and there is none such Article proceeds on the basis that it is the <ORG>s that have the power to enact laws imposing tax on inter <ORG> Sales We must now consider the arguments that have been put forward as supporting the opposite conclusion It is firstly contended that the Entries in the Legislative Lists must be construed broadly and not narrowly or in a pedantic manner and that in accordance with this principle Entry should be construed there being no limitation contained therein as inclusive of the power to tax sales in <ORG> trade and commerce and and to the principle laid down in <ORG> of British Columbia <NAME> that where there is a conflict of jurisdiction between a <ORG> and <ORG> it is the law of the <ORG> that must prevail and have to be invoked only if there is a conflict as to the scope of two Entries in the two Lists and not otherwise What has therefore first to be decided is whether there is any conflict between Entry in List I and Entry in List If there is not the application of the non obstante clause in Art There is another rule of construction also wellsettled that the Entries in two Legislative Lists must be construed if possible so as to avoid a conflict <NAME> correct approach to the question was to see whether it was possible to effect a reconciliation between the two Entries so as to avoid a conflict and overlapping and that in that view though excise duty might in a extended sense cover the first sales by the manufacturer in the context of entry in List II it should be held not to include it and that therefore the Province had the right to tax the first sales If it is possible therefore to construe Entry as not including tax on interstate sales then on the principle enunciated in <ORG> and Governor General in <ORG> Province of Madras we should so construe it as that will avoid a conflict between the two Entries It was also argued in support of the contention that Entry in List I must be held to include the power to tax that that was the interpretation put by the American authorities on the Commerce Clause and that there was no reason why a different construction should be put on Entry in list I of our Constitution The threads were no doubt taken from other Constitutions but when they were woven into the fabric of our Constitution their reach and their complexion underwent changes We should not forget that it is our Constitution that we are to interpret and that interpretation must depend on the context and setting of the particular provision which has to be interpreted a of the Constitution cannot be interpreted as throwing any light on with reference to the question of taxation as it merely reproduces of the Government of India Act and as there was no provision therein corresponding to Art could not have implied what is now sought to be inferred from Art In the result we are of opinion that if the <ORG> had the power under Entry to impose a tax on inter State sales subject only to the restriction enacted in Art We have reached this conclusion on a construction of the statutory provisions bearing on the question without reference to the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution which proceeding on the view that the <ORG> had the power to tax interState sales under Entry has amended the Constitu tion and has vested the power to tax interstate sales in the Centre VI Another contention urged by the petitioners is that the levy of tax proposed to be made by the Andhra State on the sale of yarn by them to dealers in the State of Andhra is illegal because under the Madras Act and the Rules made thereunder where there are successive sales of yarn the tax can be imposed at only one point and as the Government of Madras had already imposed a tax on the sale within that State a second levy on the self same goods by the State of Andhra is unauthorised When the Madras Act provides for a single levy on successive sales of yarn it can have only application to sales in the State of Madras as it would be incompetent to <ORG> to enact a law to operate in another State But it is argued that of the Andhra State Act on its true interpretation enacts that though for political purposes Andhra is to be regarded as a separate State for the enforcement of laws as they stood on that date it should be deemed to be a part of the State of Madras There is no substance in this contention has declared that yarn is an essential commodity and that if the Madras Act is to be construed as a fresh enactment for the Andhra State by reason of ss and of the Andhra State Act and the Adaptation Order dated November then it would be bad inasmuch as the procedure prescribed in that provision had not been followed The Madras Act was in force in the territories which now form part of the Andhra State until October and thereafter that Act continues to be in operation by force of of the Andhra State Act The petitioners sought to raise certain other contentions such as that they are not dealers in the Andhra State and that the Explanation to had no application to the sales sought to be taxed as the goods were delivered not in the State of Andhra but in Madras The petitioners challenged the respondents right to tax the sales and filed these petitions for writs of prohibition or other suitable writs restraining the respondent from levying and collecting the tax The procedures followed by the petitioners in effecting the sales were diverse and have not yet been ascertained and it is not possible without such ascertainment to decide whether they are or are not taxable under the provisions of the Act read with other relevant laws To avoid this difficulty it has been agreed between the parties that the only question that will be decided on these petitions is whether the respondent can tax a sale under which the pro perty in the goods sold passed outside the State of Andhra but the goods were delivered in that State for consumption there No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the State or in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India For the purposes of sub clause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consump tion in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State In order to bring its provisions into accord with the Constitution the President under his power mentioned earlier passed on July the Adaptation of Laws Fourth Amendment Order which added a new section to the Madras Act being This Court held by its judgment pronounced by a majority on March that a State could tax a sale under which goods were delivered within its territories for consumption there though the property in the goods passed beyond its territories and a provision in a State statute purporting to levy such a tax did not contravene Art Andhra is a new State which came into existence on October Sometime in the year the respondent the State of Andhra issued notices to the petitioners demanding taxes under its Sales Tax Act a did not confer any right on the <ORG> in which the goods were delivered under a sale to tax it notwithstanding that the property in the goods passed in another <ORG> Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court no law of a <ORG> imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce during the period between the st day of April and the th day of September shall be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been invalid merely by reason of the fact that such sale or purchase took place in the course of interstate trade or commerce and all such taxes levied or collected or purporting to have been levied or collected during the Thereupon the respondent on February filed fresh statements submitting that the petitions should be dismissed Its only effect so far as these cases are concerned is to permit the Sales Tax Act to operate to tax sales which took place in the course of trade between Andhra and any other State between certain dates As has been agreed between the parties as mentioned at the commencement of this judgment the only question that we have to decide is whether a sale under which the goods were delivered in Andhra for consumption there though property in them passed in Madras can be taxed by the respondent It is not disputed however that that definition does not include a sale under which goods are delivered in Andhra for consumption there but property in them passes in Madras and no further reference to that section is therefore necessary Section as it stood at the relevant time reads thus <NAME> Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place a i outside the State of Andhra or ii in the course of the import of the goods into the territory of India or of the export of the goods out of such territory or except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide after the st day of March in the course of inter State trade or commerce and the provisions of this Act shall be read and construed accordingly For the purposes of clause a i a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State But it seems to me impossible from the language used to say that it contemplated a case in which the goods were delivered in Andhra though property in them passed in another State What then is that clause It only contains the words outside the State of Andhra The complete sentence says Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any good where such sale or purchase takes place a i outside the State of Andhra It then savs that no tax shall be levied under the Act on a sale which takes place outside Andhra The substantive portion of the Explanation however mentions a sale which is to be deemed to have taken place inside a State This is the inevitable result produced by the opening words of the Explanation understood according to their plain meaning That language must therefore have the same meaning As a matter of language only words must have the same meaning The words for the purpose of clause a i must therefore have tile same meaning in the Explanation in Art It follows therefore that a construction cannot be put on the language used in tile Explanation which produces the result of showing a sale to be inside Andhra and so outside all other States It is no objection to this reading of the Explanation to say that the Andhra Act would then be saying when a sale is to be deemed to have taken place inside another State and it has no power to do so as it can legislate only for itself and for no other State
