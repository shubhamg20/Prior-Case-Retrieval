Punitive detention is intended to inflict punishment on a person who is found by the judicial process to have committed an offence while preventive detention is not by way of punishment at all but it is intended to pre empt a person from indulging in conduct injurious to the society Article as interpreted in <NAME> case requires that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by procedure established by law and this procedure must be reasonable fair and just and not arbitrary whimsical or fanciful and it is for the <ORG> to decide in the exercise of its constitutional power or judicial review whether the deprivation of life or personal liberty in a given case is by procedure which is reasonable fair and just or it is otherwise In case of punitive detention the person has fullest opportunity to defend himself while in case of preventive detention the opportunity that he has for contesting the action of the Executive is very limited A constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that the constitutional provision does not get atrophied or fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges Moreover it is every kind of deprivation that is hit by Article whether such deprivation be permanent or temporary and furthermore deprivation is not an act which is complete once and for all it is a continuing act and so long as it lasts it must be in accordance with procedure established by law The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it namely the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition clothing and shelter and facilities for reading writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings The magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country but it must in any view of the matter include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights Therefore any form of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would be offensive to human dignity and constitute an inroad into this right to live and it would on this view be prohibited by Article unless it is in accordance with procedure prescribed by law but no law which authorises and no procedure which leads to such torture or cruelty inhuman or degrading treatment can ever stand the test of reasonableness and non arbitrariness it would plainly be unconstitutional and void as being violative of Article and There is implicit in Article the right to protection against torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article of the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights This right to live which is comprehended within the broad connotation of the right to life can concededly be abridged according to procedure established by law and therefore when a person is lawfully imprisoned this right to live is bound to suffer attenuation to the extent to which it is incapable of enjoyment by reason of incarceration But as part of the right to live with human dignity and therefore as a necessary component of the right to life he would be entitled to have interviews with the members of his family and friends and no prison regulation or procedure laid down by prison regulation regulating the right to have interviews with the members of the family and friends can be upheld as constitutionally valid under Article and unless it is reasonable fair and just Considered from the point of view also of the right to personal liberty enshrined in Article the right to have interviews with members of the family and friends is clearly part of personal liberty guaranteed under that Article The expression personal liberty occurring in Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of a man and it also includes rights which have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Article When an under trial prisoner is granted the facility The right of a detenu to consult a legal adviser of his choice for any purpose not necessarily limited to defence in a criminal proceeding but also for securing release from preventive detention or filling a writ petition or prosecuting any claim or proceeding civil or criminal is obviously included in the right to live with human dignity and is also part of personal liberty and the detenu cannot be deprived of this right nor can this right of the detenu be interfered with except in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by a valid law The facts giving rise to the petition are few and undisputed and may be briefly stated as follows The petitioner who is a British national was arrested and detained in the Central Jail Tihar under an Order dated rd November issued under section of the COFEPOSA Act It seems that some criminal proceeding was pending against the petitioner for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country and for the purpose of her defence in such criminal proceeding it was necessary for her to consult her lawyer but even her lawyer found it difficult to obtain an interview with her because in order to arrange an interview he was required to obtain prior appointment from the District Magistrate Delhi and the interview could take place only in the presence of a <ORG> Officer nominated by the Collector of <ORG> This procedure for obtaining interview caused considerable hardship and inconvenience and there were occasions when even after obtaining prior appointment from the District Magistrate Delhi her lawyer could not have an interview with her since no <ORG> Officer nominated by the Collector of <ORG> remained present at the appointed time This restriction on interviews was imposed by the Prison Authorities by virtue of clause sub clauses i and ii of the Conditions of Detention laid down by <ORG> under an Order dated rd August issued in exercise of the powers conferred under section of the COFEPOSA Act The conditions of detention in respect of classification and interviews shall be as under a Interviews Subject to the direction issued by the Administrator from time to time permission for the grant of interviews with a detenu shall be granted by the District Magistrate Delhi as under i Interview with legal adviser Interview with legal adviser in connection with defence of a detenu in a criminal case or in regard to writ petitions and the like may be allowed by prior appointment in the presence of an officer of <ORG> to be nominated by the local Collector of <ORG> or Deputy Director of Enforcement who sponsors the case for detention It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that allowing interview with the members of the family only once in a month was discriminatory and unreasonable particularly when under trial prisoners were granted the facility of interview with relatives and friends twice in a week under Rule A and convicted prisoners were permitted to have interview with their relatives and friends once in a week under Rule of the Rules set out in the Manual for the Superintendence and Management of Jails in the Punjab The respondents resisted the contentions of the petitioner and submitted that sub clauses i and ii of clause were not violative of Articles and since the restrictions imposed by them were reasonable fair and just but stated that they would have no objection if instead of a monthly interview the petitioner was granted the facility of interview with her daughter and sister twice in a week as in the case of under trial prisoners and so far as interview with the lawyer is concerned they would not insist on the presence of a customs or excise officer at the interview Though these two concessions were made on behalf of the respondents at the hearing of the petition before us the question still remains whether sub clause i and ii of cl are valid and it is necessary that we should examine this question in the context of our constitutional values since there are a large number of detenus under the COFEPOSA Act and the conditions of their detention in regard to interviews must be finally settled by this Court Now it is necessary to bear in mind the distinction between preventive detention and punitive detention when we are considering the question of validity of conditions of detention There is a vital distinction between these two kinds of detention Punitive detention is intended to inflict punishment on a person who is found by the judicial process to have committed an offence while preventive detention is not by way of punishment at all but it is intended to pre empt a person from indulging in conduct injurious to the society It is a drastic power to detain a person without trial and there are many countries where it is not allowed to be exercised except in times of war or aggression Until the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> a very narrow and constricted meaning was given to the guarantee embodied in Art So long as there was some law which prescribed a procedure authorising deprivation of life or personal liberty it was supposed to meet the requirement of Art It is not enough to secure compliance with the prescription of Article that there should be a law prescribing some semblance of a procedure for depriving a person of his life or personal liberty but the procedure prescribed by the law must be reasonable fair and just and if it is not so the law would be void as violating the guarantee of Art as interpreted in <NAME> case supra requires that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by procedure established by law and this procedure must be reasonable fair and just and not arbitrary whimsical or fanciful and it is for the <ORG> to decide in the exercise of its constitutional power of judicial review whether the deprivation of life or personal liberty in a given case is by procedure which is reasonable fair and just or it is otherwise and if the constitutional validity of any such law is challenged the <ORG> would have to decide whether the procedure laid down by such law for depriving a person of his personal liberty is reasonable fair and just In case of punitive detention the person concerned is detained by way of punishment after he is found guilty of wrong doing as a result of trial where he has the fullest opportunity to defend himself while in case of preventive detention he is detained merely on suspicion with a view to preventing him from doing harm in future and the opportunity that he has for contesting the action of the Executive is very limited The question which then arises is whether a person preventively detained in a prison has any rights which he can enforce in <ORG> Once his freedom is curtailed by incarceration in a jail does he have any fundamental rights at all or does he leave them behind when he enters the prison gate The answer to this question is no longer res integra It has been held by this Court in the two <NAME> cases that fundamental rights do not flee the person as he enters the prison although they may suffer shrinkage necessitated by incarceration A compulsion under the authority of law following upon a conviction to live in a prison house entails to by its own force the deprivation of fundamental freedoms like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practise a profession But the Constitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment of the Constitution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law <NAME> It is interesting to note that <ORG> of the United States has also taken the same view in regard to rights of prisoners Mr Justice <NAME> reiterated his thesis when he asserted Every prisoner liberty i of courses circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement but his interest in the limited liberty left to him is then only the more substantial We will first take up for consideration the Fundamental Right of the detenu under Article because that is a Fundamental Right which has after the decision in <NAME> case supra a highly activist magnitude and it embodies a constitutional value of supreme importance in a democratic society It provides that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law and such procedure shall be reasonable fair and just This principle of interpretation which requires that a Constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that the Constitutional provision does not get atrophied or fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges applies with greater force in relation to a fundamental right enacted by the Constitution Moreover it is every kind of deprivation that is hit by Article whether such deprivation be permanent or temporary and furthermore depriva tion is not an act which is complete once and for all it is a continuing act and so long as it lasts it must be in accordance with procedure established by law We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it namely the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition clothing and shelter and facilities for reading writing and expressing one self in diverse forms freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings Of course the magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country but it must in any view of the matter include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation protanto of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights Now obviously any form of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would be offensive to human dignity and constitute an inroad into this right to live and it would on this view be prohibited by Article unless it is in accordance with procedure prescribed by law but no law which authorises and no procedure which leads to such torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment can ever stand the test of reasonableness and non arbitrariness it would plainly be unconstitutional and void as being violative of Articles and It would thus be seen that there is implicit in Article the right to protection against torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights This right to live which is comprehended within the broad connotation of the right to life can concededly be abridged according to procedure established by law and therefore when a person is lawfully imprisoned this right to live is bound to suffer attenuation to the extent to which it is incapable of enjoyment by reason of incarceration But as part of the right to live with human dignity and therefore as a necessary component of the right to life he would be entitled to have interviews with the members of his family and friends and no prison regulation or procedure laid down by prison regulation regulating the right to have interviews with the members of the family and friends can be upheld as constitutionally valid under Articles and unless it is reasonable fair and just The expression personal liberty occurring in Article has been given a broad and liberal interpretation in <NAME> case supra and it has been held in that case that the expression personal liberty used in that Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of a man and it also includes rights which have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Article The right of a detenu to consult a legal adviser of his choice for any purpose not necessarily limited to defence in a criminal proceeding but also for securing release from preventive detention of filing a writ petition or prosecuting any claim or proceeding civil or criminal is obviously included in the right to live with human dignity and is also part of personal liberty and the detenu cannot be deprived of this right nor can this right of the detenu be interfered with except in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by a valid law We accordingly allow the writ petition and grant relief to the extent indicated above
