After the conclusion of the department enquiry the respondent was dismissed from service in April by an order of the Deputy Inspector General In February the respondent filed a suit for declaration that his demotion to the post of Sergeant and subsequent dismissal from service were wrongful illegal and inoperative The order of dismissal was set aside on the ground that it had been made by the Deputy Inspector General while the appointing authority in the case of the post of Subedar Major was the Inspector General so that there was a violation of Art In appeal to this Court against the judgment of <ORG> the question that fell for consideration was was whether the reversion of the respondent from the post of officiating Subedar Major was made in circumstances which would attract the appli cability of Art HELD <NAME> case is not an authority for the proposition that so long as there are no express words of stigma attributed to the conduct of a <ORG> officer in the impugned order it cannot be held to have been made by way of punishment The form of the order is not conclusive of its true nature and it might merely be a cloak and camouflage for an order founded on misconduct It may be that an order which is innocuous on the face and does not contain any imputation of misconduct is a circumstance or a piece of evidence for finding whether it was made by way of punishment or administrative routine But the entirety of circumstances preceding or attendant on the impugned order must be examined and the overriding test will aways be whether the misconduct is a mere motive or is the very foundation of the order There was no reason to disagree with <ORG> that the order of reversion wits void <NAME> and <NAME> for tile respondent The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is in appeal by certificate from a judgment of <ORG> Oil January while he was still holding the substantive post of a Sergeant he was promoted to officiate temporarily as a Subedar Major must undergo the Sergeant course before his case was considered for promotion In February the respondent filed a suit for a declaration that his demotion from the rank of a Subedar Major to that of Sergeant and dismissal from service were wrongful illegal and inoperative and that he had all along remained a Subedar Major The order of dismissal was set aside on the short ground that if the respondent continued to remain in the post of Subedar Major even in an offi ciating capacity on the date with effect from which the order of dismissal was passed the provisions of Art The Deputy Inspector General who had passed the order of dismissal was subordinate to the authority by which he had been appointed to officiate in the post of Subedar Major that authority being the Inspector General of Police The sole point which falls for determination is whether the reversion of the respondent from the post of officiating Subedar Major was made in the circumstances which would attract the applicability of Art The services of a temporary servant or a probationer can be terminated under the rules of his employment and such termination without anything more would not attract the operation of Art The circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination have to be examined in each case the motive behind it being immaterial If the order visits the public servant with any evil consequences or casts an aspersion against his character or integrity it must be considered to be one by way of punishment no matter whether he was a mere probationer or a temporary servant An order of termination of service in unexceptionable form preceded by an enquiry launched by the superior authorities only to ascertain whether the public servant should be retained in service does not attract the operation of Art i an Enquiry Officer is appointed a charge sheet submitted explanation called for and con sidered any order of termination of service made thereafter will attract the operation of the said article The argument sought to be raised on behalf of the appellant is that the order of reversion of the respondent to his substantive post casts no aspersion against his character or integrity We are unable to accede to the contention of the appellant that the ratio of the above decision is that so long as there are no express words of stigma attributed to the conduct of a Government Officer in the impugned order it cannot be held to have been made by way of punishment It may be that an order which is innocuous on the face and does not contain any imputation of misconduct is a circumstance or a piece of evidence for finding whether it was made by way of punishment or administrative routine But the entirety of circumstances preceding or attendant on the impugned order must be examined and the overriding test will always be whether the misconduct is a mere motive or is the very foundation of the order We find no reason to disagree with the view of <ORG> The appeal fails and it is dismissed with costs
