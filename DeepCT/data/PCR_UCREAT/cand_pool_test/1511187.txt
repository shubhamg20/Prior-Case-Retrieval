KAPADIA A short question of public importance arises for determination namely whether withdrawal of A in terms of the first proviso to Section of the DRT Act inserted by the Amending Act No of is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act NPA Act for short Facts in Civil Appeal No of Since the above question arises in a batch of matters for the sake of convenience we refer briefly to the facts in civil appeal No in which <ORG> is the appellant An interlocutory application was filed by the bank in the said A to bring the properties to sell On the following provisos were introduced in Section of the DRT Act vide amending Act of Provided that the bank or financial institution may with the permission of <ORG> on an application made by it withdraw the application whether made before or after the Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws Amendment Act for the purpose of taking action under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act if no such action had been taken earlier under that Act Provided further that any application made under the first proviso for seeking permission from <ORG> to withdraw the application made under sub section shall be dealt with by it as expeditiously as possible and disposed of within thirty days from the date of such application Provided also that in case <ORG> refuses to grant permission for withdrawal of the application filed under this sub section it shall pass such orders after recording the reasons therefor On the said bank issued Possession Notice under Section of the NPA Act read with Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules Rules stating that vide notice dated the appellant herein <ORG> was called upon to repay an amount of Rs crores approximately together with interest within sixty days that the appellant had failed to repay the amount that a notice was also given to the guarantor that the bank had taken possession of the immovable properties mentioned in the schedule to the Notice and that the appellant and the guarantor were directed not to deal with those immovable properties At this point it may be noted that according to the banks appearing before us the contention raised is that the said proviso is an enabling provision that banks and financial institutions have an independent right to recover debts that the purpose behind enactment of the NPA Act was to obliterate all fetters on their right to recover the debt which earlier existed in the form of Sections and A of the Transfer of Property Act TP Act and consequently the option lay with the banks FIs to invoke or not to invoke the NPA Act The NPA Act enables the banks and <ORG> to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction The NPA Act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale In the said judgment this Court further observed that if the borrower after service of notice under Section of the NPA Act raises any objection or places facts for consideration of the secured creditor such reply to the notice must be considered by the bank <ORG> with due application of mind and reasons for not accepting the objections briefly must be given to the borrower In the said judgment it is further stated that the reasons so communicated shall only be for the purposes of information knowledge of the creditor and such reasons will not give him any right to approach the <ORG> under Section of the NPA Act The appellant herein <ORG> mainly relied on the said reasons given by this Court in <ORG> supra in support of its contention that the Notice dated under Section of NPA Act was merely a show cause notice and it did not constitute action under the NPA Act and therefore the said bank was obliged statutorily to apply for withdrawal of A No before invoking the NPA Act which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale There is one more reason for enacting NPA Act The secured assets also could not be liquidated in time The NPA Act removes the fetters which were in existence on the rights of the secured creditors The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the liability of the borrower to repay has crystallized that the debt has become due and that on account of delay the account of the borrower has become sub standard and non performing By removing all fetters on the rights of the secured creditor he is given a right to choose one or more of the cumulative remedies Conceptually there is no inherent or implied inconsistency between the two remedies Section of the Act inter alia states that where a bank or <ORG> has to recover any debt it may make an application to the <ORG> The third proviso to Section states that in case the <ORG> refuses to grant permission leave for withdrawal it shall give reasons thereof Similarly Section gives right to the defendant to set a counter claim Section empowers the <ORG> to make an interim order by way of injunction stay or attachment before judgment debarring the defendant from transferring alienating or otherwise deal with or disposing of his properties and assets Under Section the <ORG> is empowered to direct the defendant to furnish security in cases where the <ORG> is satisfied that the defendant is likely to dispose of the property or cause damage to the property in order to defeat the decree which may ultimately be passed in favour of the bank or <ORG> Section of the <ORG> Act provides for appeal to <ORG> There are other modes of recovery contemplated by Section which states that where a certificate has been issued by the <ORG> to the Recovery Officer under Section the Recovery Officer may without prejudice to the modes of recovery specified in Section recover the amount of debt by any one or more of the modes mentioned in Section Therefore asset reconstruction means acquisition by asset reconstruction company or asset management company of any right or interest created in favour of any bank or <ORG> in any loan or advance granted or created in any debentures or bonds subscribed or guarantee given to the bank or <ORG> or rights created in favour of the bank or <ORG> under letters of credit This shows that the NPA Act basically deals with a crystallized liability The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of the bank <ORG> which could be assigned to the asset management company or asset reconstruction company which in turn steps into the shoes of the secured creditor namely the bank <ORG> It includes any right or interest in the security underlying such debt or receivables It includes any beneficial interest in the property Section defines hypothecation to mean a charge created by a borrower in favour of a secured creditor as a security for financial assistance Section defines the word originator to mean the owner of a financial asset which is acquired by a reconstruction company or asset management company for the purposes of the NPA Act as it deems fit Section of the NPA Act inter alia states that the bank or <ORG> may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person In other cases it may give such notice if it is satisfied that the financial asset is not likely to be disposed of or alienated by the borrower It gives discretion to the bank <ORG> to take steps in order to protect its assets from being alienated transferred or disposed of in any other manner Section empowers <ORG> to give directions from time to time It states inter alia that notwithstanding anything contained in Section or Section A of the TP Act any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the court intervention by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act Where any borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security agreement makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any instalment thereof and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor within sixty days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under sub section On reading Section which is the heart of the controversy in the present case one finds that if a borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor makes any default in repayment of secured debt and his account in respect of such debt is classified as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge his liabilities within sixty days from the date of the notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights given in Section Reading Section it is clear that the said sub section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is already under a liability and further that his account in the books of the bank or <ORG> is classified as sub standard doubtful or loss The NPA Act comes into force only when both these conditions are satisfied Section proceeds on the basis that the debt has become due It proceeds on the basis that the account of the borrower in the books of bank <ORG> which is an asset of the bank <ORG> has become non performing Therefore there is no scope of any dispute regarding the liability There is a difference between accrual of liability determination of liability and liquidation of liability Section deals with liquidation of liability There is no inherent or implied inconsistency between these two remedies under the two different Acts Therefore the doctrine of election has no application in this case After classification of an account as NPA a last opportunity is given to the borrower of sixty days to repay the debt Section A inserted by amending Act of after the judgment of this Court in <ORG> supra whereby the borrower is permitted to make representation objection to the secured creditor against classification of his account as NPA A proviso is added to Section A which states that the reasons so communicated shall not confer any right upon the borrower to file an application to the DRT under Section Such notice of demand therefore constitutes an action taken under the provisions of NPA Act and such notice of demand cannot be compared to a show cause notice In fact because it is a notice of demand which constitutes an action Section A provides for an opportunity to the borrower to make representation to the secured creditor Once the two conditions under Section are fulfilled the next step which the bank or <ORG> is entitled to take is either to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower or to take over management of the business of the borrower or to appoint any manager to manage the secured assets or require any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower to pay the secured creditor towards liquidation of the secured debt Therefore Section inter alia provides that once the bank FI takes possession of the secured asset then the rights title and interest in that asset can be dealt with by the bank FI as if it is the owner of such an asset It inter alia provides for payment of surplus to the person entitled thereto Section inter alia states that if the dues of the secured creditor together with all costs charges and expenses incurred are tendered to the secured creditor before the debt fixed for sale transfer the secured asset shall not be sold or transferred by the bank FI to the asset reconstruction company and no further steps shall be taken in that regard The reason is that the NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the liability of the borrower has crystallized and that his account is classified as non performing asset in the hands of the bank FI Section inter alia states that where the dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied by the sale proceeds of the secured assets the secured creditor may file an application to <ORG> under Section of the NPA Act for recovery of balance amount from the borrower Section therefore shows that the bank FI is not only free to move under NPA Act with or without leave of <ORG> but having invoked NPA Act liberty is given statutorily to the secured creditors banks FIs In fact Section indicates that the notice under Section in effect operates as an attachment injunction restraining the borrower from disposing of the secured assets and therefore such a notice which in the present case is dated is not a mere show cause notice but it is an action taken under the provision of the NPA Act Section of NPA Act confers right to appeal It inter alia states that any person including borrower aggrieved by exercise of rights by the secured creditor under Section may make an application to the <ORG> as an appellate authority within forty five days from the date on which action under Section is taken A proviso is added to Section by amending Act of It states that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower However under Section the <ORG> is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in Section taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security are in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act and the Rules made thereunder If the <ORG> after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence produced by the parties comes to the conclusion that any of the measures taken under Section are not in accordance with the NPA Act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession management to the borrower vide Section of NPA Act On the other hand after the <ORG> declares that the recourse taken by the secured creditor under Section is in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to any one or more of the measures specified under Section to recover his secured debt In our view Section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any of the measures under Section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in the given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under Section comes in conflict with let us say the provision under the State land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of Section shall override the local law This position also stands clarified by Section of the NPA Act which states that the provisions of NPA Act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the NPA Act Section gives an overriding effect to the NPA Act with all other laws if such other laws are inconsistent with the NPA Act As far as the present case is concerned the remedies are complimentary to each other and therefore the doctrine of election has no application to the present case In the present matter there is a controversy with regard to payment of court fee in the matter of appeal to <ORG> against the action taken under Section of the NPA Act As stated above any person including borrower aggrieved by action taken under Section of NPA Act is entitled to move the tribunal in appeal under Section of NPA Act <ORG> however found that a borrower who was entitled to carry the matter further against the action taken under Section was also required to pay court fees which give rise to difficulties and therefore it enacted the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Removal of Difficulties Order Order under Section of the NPA Act to make provisions for levying fees in the matter of filing of application appeal under Sections and of the NPA Act respectively We quote hereinbelow the contents of the said Order NOW THEREFORE in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of section of the said Act <ORG> hereby makes the following Order to make the provisions of levying of the fee for filing of appeals under sections and of the said Act being not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act to remove the difficulty namely ii It shall come into force at once This Order has continued even after amending Act of which as stated above came into force with effect from As stated above by the said amending Act of an avenue to challenge was provided to any person including a borrower who is aggrieved by any of the measures taken by the secured creditor under Section subject to his paying fees along with his application Till today there are no rules prescribing the court fees for filing applications to the <ORG> under Section Points for determination Three points arise for determination in these cases ii Whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of Section of the NPA Act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immovable property He urged that Notice dated given by <ORG> under Section of NPA Act was a mere show cause notice that it did not constitute action so as to exclude the applicability of the proviso to Section of <ORG> Act consequently it was urged that on the facts of the present case in the matter of <ORG> the bank should have taken permission of the <ORG> for withdrawal of A No before invoking the NPA Act Reliance on second proviso was placed in support of the argument that if the bank or <ORG> is permitted to invoke both the remedies simultaneously then the very object of expeditious disposal would stand defeated However learned counsel invited our attention to Para of the judgment of this <ORG> in <ORG> supra which states that before taking any action a notice of sixty days was required to be given and after the measures under Section of the NPA Act have been taken a mechanism had been provided under Section of the NPA Act to approach the <ORG> Placing reliance on Para of the said judgment learned counsel urged that in the said paragraph this <ORG> has used the expression action in juxtaposition to the words measures adopted under Section therefore even this <ORG> did not understand the word notice under Section as action taken Learned counsel urged that action taken under Section of the NPA Act can only be the steps taken by the bank or <ORG> under Section and therefore notice of sixty days under Section was a mere show cause notice which did not constitute action taken and therefore the proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act was applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case in which <ORG> is the appellant Reliance was also placed on the provisions of Section A which enables the borrower to make any representation objection to the secured creditor and if the secured creditor rejects such representation then the proviso states that the reasons so communicated by the bank or <ORG> shall not provide right upon the borrower to make an application under Section to the <ORG> In the proviso the words used are that even a likely action by the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons shall not confer any right upon the borrower to prefer an application under Section to <ORG> Since no appeal is provided for against the order rejecting representation and since Section of the NPA Act provides remedy to the borrower only against action taken under Section the scheme of Section suggests that the notice under Section should be read only as a show cause notice Similarly reliance is placed by the learned counsel on the provisions of Section of the NPA Act which states that where the dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied the secured creditor may file an application to the <ORG> for the recovery of the balance It was further urged that even conceptually there is a difference between the right to debt and the right to take action of recovery that these two concepts are totally different concepts that one is a right to receive and the other is a right to enforce Applying these concepts to the scope of the NPA Act learned counsel urged that the NPA Act only gives certain powers to the bank <ORG> to enforce a recovery of debt and for that purpose it excludes Section of the TP Act vis vis certain acts specified therein Learned counsel places reliance on these words in support of his contention that there is no need to apply for withdrawal of the A where the recovery stands enforced Learned counsel urged that Section does not create a vested right of any action and therefore no remedy against the notice is provided for Reliance was also placed in support of his above arguments on Section of the NPA Act which states that no borrower shall after receipt of notice under Section transfer by way of sale lease or otherwise other than in the ordinary course of business any of the secured assets without prior written consent of the secured creditor Alternatively it was urged that even assuming for the sake of argument that Section notice creates a right to take action such a right is not a vested right and is at best contingent on other factors namely continuation of action by secured creditors even after representations Learned counsel urged that Section refers to a right at the highest at an inchoate stage that Section only refers to Section in the context of the period fixed that before introduction of Section A no opportunity to represent was there and consequently Section notice is only a show cause notice Learned counsel urged that in view of Section of the <ORG> Act it cannot be said that the <ORG> has no inherent powers It was urged that the said doctrine postulates that when two remedies are available for the same relief the aggrieved party has an option to elect either of the two but not both Learned counsel therefore urged that the proviso to Section mandates that either one of the two remedies can be resorted to at a time but not both and in view of the statutory interventions there is no option with the secured creditor but to withdraw the <ORG> proceedings to cases where the proviso to Section of <ORG> Act is applied In reply to the above submissions Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for <ORG> the bank submitted that Section notice is a condition precedent for invoking Section of the NPA Act and therefore the said notice is an action and not a mere show cause notice Learned counsel urged that Section notice is given on the basis that the client account in the books of account which is an asset of the bank as the amount receivable under that account has become sub standard doubtful or a loss that Section proceeds on the basis of classification of that account as a NPA that there is no adjudication contemplated under Section as the said section deals with enforcement of security interest alone which security interest is recognized by the Act as a financial asset of the bank <ORG> He urged that if the proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act is read as mandatory then the consequence would be that a secured creditor can have recourse to Section only with the prior permission of the <ORG> which would defeat the very object of the NPA Act which is to remove all fetters if any on the right of enforcement by the secured creditor It was next urged that the <ORG> does not have inherent powers and that Section of the <ORG> Act which empowers the tribunal to issue appropriate directions for enforcement of its orders is not akin to Section CPC and therefore a provision akin to the provision was necessary to be inserted In this connection learned senior counsel submitted that in the <ORG> Act there was no provision similar to Order XXIII CPC and to get rid of that lacuna the <ORG> Act had to be amended If the bank <ORG> seeks to invoke the NPA Act vis vis a financial asset over which a court receiver is appointed or over which an attachment stands then in such cases an enabling provision is made whereby the bank or <ORG> can move the <ORG> for permission seeking withdrawal of A in part or in whole in order to enable the bank <ORG> to take appropriate steps for enforcement of security under the NPA Act Learned counsel submitted that there is no bar to the application of both the Acts simultaneously He submitted that the NPA Act gives to the bank <ORG> an independent right and wherever required the bank <ORG> may apply that option as given to the secured creditor In fact it is pointed out by the learned counsel that the amending Act of has made changes in both the <ORG> Act and the NPA Act simultaneously which indicates that both the Acts complement each other He submitted that the enabling provision under the first proviso had to be made so that withdrawal is restricted to cases where the bank <ORG> wishes to withdraw the A for the purpose of taking action under the NPA Act and not for any other purpose In this connection learned counsel submitted that Section provides for a fresh cause of action On the question of doctrine of election learned counsel submitted that the doctrine of election is an aspect of estoppel which can have no effect on the operation of a statute inasmuch as it is well settled that there can be no estoppel against a statute Learned counsel further contended that there is no merit in the arguments advanced on behalf of the borrowers that the amendments under Act of introduced into the <ORG> Act has restricted the rights of the secured creditors under the NPA Act He urged that this argument has no basis as there is no amendment restricting any of the rights of secured creditors under the NPA Act He submitted that the NPA Act deals with the secured creditors including banks and financial institutions and the persons mentioned in sub section zd to Section He submitted that the NPA Act is the special Act whose provisions override all other laws inconsistent therewith In this connection he places reliance on Section of the NPA Act Learned counsel urged that Act of amended the NPA Act as well as the <ORG> Act simultaneously that the said Act of specifically amended Section by insertion of sub section A however no provision corresponding to the proviso to Section was introduced into the NPA Act which indicates that <ORG> did not intend to dilute rights of the secured creditors granted to them under the NPA Act through <ORG> Act He also invited our attention to Section of the NPA Act which provides that the NPA Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the <ORG> Act Learned counsel urged that there may be innumerable situations in which the secured creditor may have to withdraw the recovery application and but for a specific provision it was not open to the tribunal to entertain an application for withdrawal and in any case it was not open to the tribunal to pass conditional order on such application for withdrawal without express provision in that regard which now is the proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act Similarly if the mortgage property is not subject to any attachment or court receiver there is no need for permission to withdraw the application before resorting to Section In this connection reliance was also placed on the provisions of Section of the NPA Act which requires the claims to be made under NPA Act within the period prescribed under the Limitation Act Learned counsel therefore submitted that there is no merit in the contention of the appellant that the banks FIs should be compelled to first withdraw their As before resorting to Section of NPA Act Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> submitted that the doctrine of election does not apply to curative relief He submitted that the object of both the sections is to recover dues that there is no inconsistency inherent or implied in the two remedies that the doctrine of election applies in cases of inconsistent remedies He submitted that the judgment of this Court in the case of <ORG> supra has no application because in that case this Court has held that the State Financial Corporation Act has expressly provided for the doctrine of election Learned counsel submitted that the doctrine of election is a doctrine evolved by courts on equity It is based on the principle that a man shall not be allowed to approbate and reprobate Thus a creditor whose claim is secured by two written obligations falling due simultaneously has a right to proceed thereafter upon either or both of them to enforce payment of the amount due In this connection learned senior counsel placed reliance on Corpus Juris Secundam Vol He submitted that because Section notice constituted an action taken under the Act Section A becomes necessary because it gives an opportunity to the borrower to object to the notice He submitted that a secured asset is an asset which is owned by the bank FI and therefore it can act without intervention of the court Learned counsel therefore submitted that <ORG> Act is a special Act and therefore irrespective of the pendency of litigation under the <ORG> Act acquisition of interest in financial assets can take place under the <ORG> Act The <ORG> Act is made in addition to the Companies Act the SEBI Act the <ORG> Act as well as the Securities Contracts Regulation Act and therefore the doctrine of election has no application in this case <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for <ORG> submitted that Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules Rules states that a demand notice is the notice in writing issued by a secured creditor to any borrower pursuant to Section of the NPA Act Reliance is placed on the said rule to show that the notice under Section is not a mere show cause notice that it is a demand notice similar to Section of the Income Tax Act Learned counsel submitted that under Rule of the Rules the service of demand notice under Section indicates the procedure to be followed in serving such notice and if the amount mentioned in the demand notice is not paid within the stipulated period then Rule provides that the Authorised Officer of a bank FI shall proceed to realise the amount by adopting any one or more of the measures specified in Section Learned counsel submitted that there is a basic difference between suits to recover debts and suits to enforce securities that NPA Act deals with enforcement of securities and it does not wait for debts to crystallize and therefore A filed in the <ORG> will not be required to be withdrawn in the event action by way of Section notice is taken even before The doctrine of election would not apply to the proceedings under the NPA Act and the <ORG> Act It is urged that the nature ambit and scope of the proceedings under the two Acts are different that the legislative purpose for conferring the power on the secured creditors to enforce its security interest by taking recourse to Section of NPA Act without intervention of the court is to free the secured creditors of the impediments contained in Section of the TP Act Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> submitted that the doctrine of election is for banks FIs Learned counsel urged that unlike SICA in the NPA Act there is no proviso saving limitation and therefore if the argument of the borrowers is accepted it could lead to a situation where the banks action under NPA Act would be time barred <NAME> learned counsel for <ORG> has adopted the above arguments advanced on behalf of the various banks The heart of the matter is that NPA Act proceeds on the basis that an interest in the asset pledged or mortgaged with the bank or FI is created in favour of the bank FI that the borrower has become a Debtor his liability has crystallized and that his account with the bank FI which is an asset with the bank FI has become sub standard A right created in favour of the bank FI involves corresponding obligation on the part of the borrower to see that the value of the security does not depreciate with the passage of time which occurs due to his failure to repay the loan in time The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that security interest vests in the bank FI The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that security interest vests in the bank FI But under NPA Act authority is given to the banks FIs which is not there in the DRT Act to assign the secured interest to securitisation company asset reconstruction company <ORG>roadly there are three types of security over the asset One is where the creditor obtains interest in the asset concerned mortgage The third is charge where the creditor neither obtains ownership nor possession of the asset but the asset is appropriated to the satisfaction of the debt or obligation in question charge Therefore when Section talks about taking possession of the secured assets or management of the business of the borrower it is because a right is created by the borrower in favour of the bank FI when he takes a loan secured by pledge hypothecation mortgage or charge These are some of the factors which the Authorised Officer of the bank FI has to keep in mind when he gives notice under Section of the NPA Act There are three elements of election namely existence of two or more remedies inconsistencies between such remedies and a choice of one of them page if in truth there is only one remedy then the doctrine of election does not apply Even according to <ORG> Thirty first Edition page the doctrine of election of remedies is applicable only when there are two or more co existent remedies available to the litigants at the time of election which are repugnant and inconsistent In any event there is no repugnancy nor inconsistency between the two remedies therefore the doctrine of election has no application In our view the judgments of <ORG> which have taken the view that the doctrine of election is applicable are erroneous and liable to be set aside The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the debtor has failed not only to repay the debt but he has also failed to maintain the level of margin and to maintain value of the security at a level is the other obligation of the debtor It is for this reason that Sections and of the NPA Act proceeds on the basis that security interest in the bank FI needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the court tribunal that liability of the borrower has accrued and on account of default in repayment the account of the borrower in the books of the bank has become non performing For the above reasons NPA Act states that the enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process and that the said Act removes all fetters under the above circumstances on the rights of the secured creditor The DRT is a tribunal it is the creature of the statute it has no inherent power which exists in the civil courts Order XXIII Rule CPC states inter alia that where the court is satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject matter of a suit or part of a claim then the civil court may on such terms as it thinks fit grant the plaintiff permission to withdraw the entire suit or such part of the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect thereof Order XXIII Rule states that any fresh suit instituted on permission granted shall not exclude limitation and the plaintiff should be bound by law of limitation as if the first suit had not been instituted It states that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit the <ORG> shall order such agreement compromise or satisfaction to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith One cannot lose sight of the fact that even an application for withdrawal leave takes time for its disposal ii On Point No on question of possession The short question under this head is whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower under Section of the NPA Act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immovable property Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective borrowers submitted that Section of the NPA Act empowers the secured creditor to take possession of the secured immovable assets of the borrower on expiry of sixty days and notice served under Section of that Act have taken actual physical possession whereas in other cases they have taken only a symbolic possession Learned advocates further submitted that under Section the bank FI is prevented from selling the secured assets if the dues of the secured creditor with all costs charges and expenses are tendered to the secured creditor at any time before the date fixed for sale We do not find any merits on the above contentions for the following reasons The dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the Act As stated above there is a conceptual distinction between securities by which the creditor obtains ownership of or interest in the property concerned mortgages and securities where the creditor obtains neither an interest in nor possession of the property but the property is appropriated to the satisfaction of the debt charges Basically the NPA Act deals with the former type of securities under which the secured creditor namely the bank FI obtains interest in the property concerned It is for this reason that the NPA Act ousts the intervention of the courts tribunals Keeping the above conceptual aspect in mind we find that Section of the NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the borrower who is under a liability has failed to discharge his liability within the period prescribed under Section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realizing the secured assets Section A refers to the word possession simpliciter There is no dichotomy in sub section A as pleaded on behalf of the borrowers Under Rule of the Rules the authorised officer is empowered to take possession by delivering the possession notice prepared as nearly as possible in Appendix IV to the Rules That notice is required to be affixed on the property Rule deals with sale of immovable secured assets Appendix IV prescribes the form of possession notice It inter alia states that notice is given to the borrower who has failed to repay the amount informing him and the public that the bank FI has taken possession of the property under Section read with Rule of the Rules Rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession Rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser in the form given in Appendix to the Rules Rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor Section of the NPA Act states that where the possession of any secured asset is required to be taken by the secured creditor or if any of the secured asset is required to be sold or transferred the secured creditor may for the purpose of taking possession request in writing to the District Magistrate to take possession thereof Section of NPA Act refers to right of appeal Section states that if the <ORG> as an appellate authority after examining the facts and circumstances of the case comes to the conclusion that any of the measures under Section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the provisions of the Act it may by order declare that the recourse taken to any one or more measures is invalid and consequently restore possession to the borrower and can also restore management of the business of the borrower Therefore the scheme of Section read with Section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the Act then the <ORG> is entitled to put the clock back by restoring the status quo ante Therefore it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession As stated above the NPA Act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process therefore to say that the rights of the borrower would be defeated without adjudication would be erroneous Rule undoubtedly refers to sale of immovable secured asset However Rule indicates that where possession is taken by the authorised officer before issuance of sale certificate under Rule the authorised officer shall take steps for preservation and protection of secured assets till they are sold or otherwise disposed of Under Section if the dues of the secured creditor together with all costs charges and expenses incurred by him are tendered to the creditor before the date fixed for sale or transfer the asset shall not be sold or transferred The costs charges and expenses referred to in Section will include costs charges and expenses which the authorised officer incurs for preserving and protecting the secured assets till they are sold or disposed of in terms of Rule Thus Rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under Rule The court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases where the court receiver finds that a third party interest is likely to be created overnight he can take actual possession even prior to the decree The authorized officer under Rule has greater powers than even a court receiver as security interest in the property is already created in favour of the banks FIs Therefore Rule provides that till issuance of the sale certificate under Rule the authorized officer shall take such steps as he deems fit to preserve the secured asset It is well settled that third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bona fide purchaser for value without notice It is these types of disputes which are sought to be avoided by Rule read with Rule of the Rules In the circumstances the drawing of dichotomy between symbolic and actual possession does not find place in the scheme of the NPA Act read with the Rules It is submitted that in exercise of powers conferred under Section of the NPA Act <ORG> has issued an Order called the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Removal of Difficulties Order Order making the provision for levying of fees for filing of appeals It is further pointed out that on this Court delivered its judgment in the case of <ORG> supra Learned advocates submitted that under Section of NPA Act as amended a proviso is added which states that different fees may be prescribed for making an application by the borrower We do not find any merits in the above contentions for the following reasons It is true that Section of the NPA Act states inter alia that a borrower aggrieved by action taken under Section may make an application along with fees as may be prescribed to the <ORG> having jurisdiction in the matter In our view the marginal note to Section cannot control the text and the content of Section which as stated above states that the borrower aggrieved by any of the measures in Section may make an application to the <ORG> In fact the proviso to Section indicates that different fees may be prescribed for making an application by the borrower Certain measures taken under Section like taking over the management of the fee vis a vis the secured creditor taking possession of financial assets have to bear different fees Lastly we do not find any merit in the argument advanced on behalf of the borrowers that since fees have not been prescribed by the rules after fees cannot be levied on the basis of the Order which was there prior to The contention of the borrowers is that since Section of NPA Act as amended provides for prescribing fees for an application under Section and since no rule has been framed under the NPA Act after fees cannot be levied under the Order dated which according to the borrower has come to an end after with the enactment of the amending Act of We do not find any merit in this last argument also reported in one of the questions which arose for determination was whether <ORG> in the exercise of its power to remove difficulties under the Income Tax Act similar to Section of the NPA Act was competent to supply a deficiency in the Act This raises two questions Is this a difficulty within the contemplation of clause of the Regulation Is <ORG> in the exercise of its power under that clause competent to supply a deficiency or casus omissus of this nature This is particularly true when <ORG> undertakes legislation which gives a new dimension to socio economic activities of the <ORG> or extends the existing Indian laws to new territories or areas freshly merged in the Union of India Again the difficulty contemplated by the clause must be a difficulty arising in giving effect to the provisions of the Act and not a difficulty arising aliunde or an extraneous difficulty The above principles particularly the distinction between a difficulty which falls within the purview of the Removal of Difficulty Clause and one which falls outside it finds ample illustration in the Order and the impugned provision of the Order which came up for consideration in <ORG> case SCR The Order related to the removal of a difficulty which had arisen in giving effect to the provisions of Section vi Proviso and Section of the Act corresponding to Section i and Section of the Act of The written down value of the assets acquired before the previous year would have been taken as the original cost of the assets without deduction of the depreciation actually allowed in the past under the State laws Far from supplanting or changing the essence of the essential provisions of the Act relating to depreciation and written down value it gave effect life and meaning to them After the amending Act of certain amendments have been made in Section of NPA Act supra it has been held that Section of the State Financial <ORG> Act SFC Act provides for the rights and remedies as also the procedure for enforcement of the rights In the said judgment it has been further held that Section has been enacted to take care of a situation where any industrial concern in breach of any agreement makes default in repayment of the loan or advance or the <ORG> requires immediate repayment which the defaulter fails to make In our view the judgment in <ORG> supra has no application to the present case Under the SFC Act Section uses the expression without prejudice to the provisions of Section therefore it is held in the above judgment that Section is wider in scope than Section which concerns attachment before judgment In the circumstances the judgment of this Court in <ORG> supra has no application This judgment has no application to the facts of the present case Accordingly we answer the above three questions in the affirmative that is in favour of the banks
