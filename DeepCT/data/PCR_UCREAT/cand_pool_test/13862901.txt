The validity of the admission programme and the preference given to Christian students are the issues that need to be resolved in these cases <ORG> inter alia laid down as follows Admission to A Pass A Vocational Studies Courses be based on the merit of the percentage of marks secured by students in qualifying examination However the <ORG> may give weightage to marks obtained in one or more individual subjects in addition to the aggregate marks of the qualifying examination On June the University issued another circular to Principals of all <ORG>s intimating inter alia that Admission to A Pass A Vocational study courses be based on the merit of the percentage of marks secured by students in the qualifying examination However the <ORG> may give weightage to marks obtained in one or more individual subjects in addition to the aggregate marks of the qualifying examination When the matter thus stood a student by name <NAME> seeking admission to the <ORG> for under graduate course filed a Writ Petition No in <ORG> under Article of the Constitution challenging the admission schedule of St That even assuming without conceding that within the general power of the regulations the <ORG> has power to prescribe the date for admission this would be ex facie violative of the fundamental right of the college as fixing of this schedule is ex facie managerial The <ORG> therefore is bound to follow the two directions in question which have been given by the <ORG> to all colleges alike in exercise of its statutory power under the relevant Ordinances of the <ORG> The Institution imparts education in several courses of study like Inter Agriculture Inter Home Science Indian Dairy Diploma IDD Sc in Agriculture Sc Home Economics Tech in Agricultural Engineering Sc in Agriculture and Sc in Agricultural Engineering It claims to be a national institute and every year it holds entrance test at different centers Students from other States including foreign students but excluding <ORG> and <ORG> sponsored students The first two questions are relevant only to <ORG> and they do not arise in the case of <ORG> since there is no dispute as to the minority character of that institute There is also no grievance by <ORG> with the procedure of selection of candidates followed by the institute We may take up these questions in turn but before doing so we may briefly refer to some to the cases where similar problem came up for consideration There was thus little difficulty for the <ORG> to accept the claim of <ORG> that it was a linguistic minority institution entitled to protection under Article of the Constitution The College and other forty two primary schools are run for the benefit of the religious denomination of <ORG> and Indian Christians generally though admission is not denied to students belonging to other communities there was again no serious dispute that the institution concerned i <ORG> was founded by Jesuits of Ranchi who were a Christian minority Since <ORG> have a distinct script of their own namely Devnagri this Court held that they are entitled to invoke the right guaranteed under Article because they are a section of citizens having a distinct script It was also observed that the religious or linguistic minorities need not be so in relation to the entire population of the country and it is enough if they are so in relation to the particular legislation or the State concerned After referring to the history of <ORG> it was stated that though <ORG> is a majority community in the whole of India the <ORG> which comprise of members of <ORG> is a religious minority in Punjab and that they are entitled to claim the right under Articles and since the <ORG> was established the administered by that religious minority with a script of its own Having regard to the nature of the contention raised it was found necessary for this Court to make a detailed study of the history of the <ORG> in the light of the provisions of the University Act The Court observed that although the nucleus of <ORG> was <ORG> which was till a teaching institution the conversion of that College into the University was not by the Muslim minority but it took place by virtue of the Act of which was passed by the then <ORG> As there was no <ORG> existing till the Act of and since it was brought into being by the Act of <ORG> the Court refused to hold that it was established by the Muslim minority It was also concluded that there is no proof to justify the claim that the <ORG> owed its establishment to the Muslim minority and they therefore have no right to administer the University by virtue of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article Record book of <ORG> the copies of letters written to <ORG> by <ORG> of <ORG> at Bhagalpur minutes of the meetings held and the resolutions passed by <ORG> were all relied upon in support of the conclusion On the Second ground this Court observed at It is unnecessary to enter upon an enquiry whether all the persons who took part in establishing the school in were Indian citizens Prior to the enactment of the Constitution there was no settled concept of Indian citizenship and it cannot be said that Christian Missionaries who had settle in India and the local Christian residents of Bhagalpur did not form a minority community It does not confer upon foreigners not resident in India the right to set up educational institutions of their choice It is not however predicated that protection of the right guaranteed under Article may be availed of only in respect of an institution established before the Constitution by persons born and resident in British India xxxx xxxx xxxx Article guarantees the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions the article does not expressly refer to citizenship as a qualification for the members of the minorities And later at We are also unable to agree with <ORG> that before any protection can be claimed under Article in respect of <ORG> it was required to be proved that all persons or a majority of them who established the institution were Indian citizens in the year There is by now fairly abundant case law on the questions as to minority the minority right to establish and their right to administer educational institutions These questions have arisen in regard to a variety of institutions all over the country It should be borne in mind that the words establish and administer used in Article are to be read conjunctively The right claimed by a minority community to administer the educational institution depends upon the proof of establishment of the institution The proof of establishment of the institution is thus a condition precedent for claiming the right to administer the institution Prior to the commencement of the Constitution of India there was no settled concept of Indian citizenship Article is a protective measure only for the benefit of religious and linguistic minorities and it is essential to make it absolutely clear that no ill fit or camouflaged institution should get away with the constitutional protection With these prefatory remarks we may now examine the claim of <ORG> in the light of the submissions made by the parties Mr <NAME> counsel for the petitioner in No has specifically urged that the <ORG> was established not by Indian residents but by foreign Mission from the <ORG> and therefore it is not entitled to claim the benefit of Article From the counter affidavit filed by Dr <NAME> the Principal of the <ORG> in Nos of and from the publication of The History of the <ORG> the following facts and circumstances could be noted The <ORG> was founded in as a Christian Missionary <ORG> by the <ORG> Mission in Delhi in collaboration with the society for the Propagation of the Gospel <ORG> whose members were residents in India The contention to the contrary urged by Mr <NAME> counsel for the petitioner in No of is therefore incorrect It would thus appear that since its foundation in <ORG> has apparently maintained its Christian character and that would be evident from its very name emblem moto the establishment of a <ORG> and its religious instruction in the Christian Gospel for religious assembly The Constitution as it stands today again maintains the essential character of the <ORG> as a Christian <ORG> without compromising the right to administer it as an educational institution of its choice True Rule provides that <ORG> of the <ORG> has no jurisdiction over the administration of the <ORG> and it shall be looked after by <ORG> Out of thirteen categories only three categories might be non Christians and therefore it makes little difference in the Christian character of <ORG> of the <ORG> But we find no substance in the contention In the first place it may be stated that the <ORG> or any instrumentality of the <ORG> cannot deprive the character of the institution founded by a minority community by compulsory affiliation since Article is a special right to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice Th right to administer is the right to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution Reasonable regulations however are permissible but regulations should be of regulatory nature and not of abridgment of the right guaranteed under Article Secondly we find no provision in the Delhi <ORG> Act with overriding powers precluding the management of the <ORG> from exercising its right to administer the <ORG> as a minority institution Under Section the <ORG> has powers to hold examinations and to grant to and confer degrees and other academic distinctions on persons who have perused a course of study in the <ORG> or in any college Section provides power to promulgate Ordinances which may provide procedure for the admission of students to the University and their enrolment as such Clause of Ordinance states that the candidates seeking admission to a course of study must satisfy the rules and conditions made in that behalf Applications by students seeking admission to Master courses in Faculties of Arts Mathematical Sciences Social Sciences Music and Science shall be sent to the Deans of Faculties concerned direct Applications for admission to courses other than those mentioned above shall be made to the Principal of the college concerned Subject to the provisions of the Act the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University <ORG> shall take a decision in respect of matters among others organising admission of students From these and other relevant provisions of the Act and Ordinances we have not been able to find any indications either in the general scheme or in other specific provisions which would enable us to say that the <ORG> is legally precluded from maintaining its minority character It is therefore wrong to state that there is no admission to the <ORG> but only for the <ORG> It is equally important to note that under Rule of the Rules of the <ORG> Society the management has not accepted all rules and regulations relating to composition of Governing Bodies management of <ORG>s appointment of Principals etc It is said that if students are admitted purely on the basis of marks obtained by them in the qualifying examination it would be not possible for any Christian student to get admission The Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes candidates who are having a minimum of per cent of marks are called for interview for selection to honours courses The Christian students who get concession up to per cent and thereby get preferential admission are only per cent to per cent The first circular fixing the last date for receipt of applications for admission was sought to be justified on the ground that it was intended to ensure uniformity in the admission dates in all colleges and it would be beneficial to and in the interests of students who are seeking admission in different colleges With regard to the second circular of the <ORG> it was contended that the admission based on the merit determined by the marks secured by the applicants in the qualifying examinations would exclude arbitrariness in the selection and ensure fairness to all applicants It was also submitted that the circulars are regulative in character and do not impinge upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article to <ORG> as a minority institution Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The minorities whether based on religion or language have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The <ORG> therefore has the right to regulate the standard of education and allied matters In the same case <NAME> put the principles with a different emphasis at The right of the minorities to administer educational institutions does not however prevent the making of reasonable regulations in respect of those institutions The right to administer educational institutions can plainly not include the right to maladminister The State can prescribe regulations to ensure the excellence of the institution Prescription of standards for educational institutions does not militate against the right of the minority to administer the institutions The right to minority whether religious or linguistic to administer educational institutions and the power of the <ORG> to regulate academic matters and management is now fairly well settled The right to administer does not include the right to maladminister The <ORG> being he controlling authority has right and duty to regulate all academic matters Regulations however shall not have the effect of depriving the right of minorities to educate their children in their own institution That is a privilege which is implied in the right conferred by Article The <ORG> direction to the minority run college to reserve per cent of seats for <ORG> selected candidates with a threat to withdraw the grant in aid and recognition was struck down as infringing the fundamental right guaranteed to minorities under Article of the Constitution It was also observed that the rule sanctioning such refusal of permission crosses the barrier of regulatory measures and comes in the region of interference with the administration of the institution a right which is guaranteed to the minority under Article It was found that the students of the minority community could not compete with the students belonging to other communities In the instant case also the impugned directives of the <ORG> to select students on the uniform basis of marks secured in the qualifying examinations would deny the right of <ORG> to admit students belonging to Christian community It has been the experience of the <ORG> as seen from the chart of selection produced in the case that unless some concession is provided to Christian students they will have no chance of getting into the college If they are thrown into the competition with the generality of students belonging to other communities they cannot even be brought within the zone of consideration for the interview The candidates are called for interview in the ratio of or depending upon the candidates choice of selection of courses of study There is nothing on record to suggest that the interview conducted by <ORG> was contrary to the principles laid down by this <ORG> in the aforesaid decisions For institutions on the other hand it was claimed that any preference given to the religious minority candidates in their own institutions cannot be a dis cremation falling under Article They are also entitled to admit them to the exclusion of all others and that right flows from the right to establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under Article Before grappling with the issue we may turn to the decision of <ORG> which is under appeal before us Both the Articles operate in the same field namely educational institutions The right guaranteed to minorities under Article to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice cannot be read in isolation and it has to be interpreted in a manner that it does not destroy the right in Article It has overlooked the difference in perspective underlying in Articles and <ORG> itself sought to make a distinction between the right of any section of the citizens to conserve its language script or culture and the right of minorities based on religion or language to establish and administer institution of their choice <ORG> however had retained the word minority in the latter part of draft Article which later became the present Article It gave no fundamental right to these communities It only imposed the duty and added a clause that while the <ORG> may have the right to impose limitations upon these rights of language culture and script the <ORG> shall not make any law which may be called oppressive not that the <ORG> has no right to make a law affecting these matters but that the law shall not be oppressive the protection granted in the original article was very insecure However it has been consistently held by the <ORG> that the right to establish an educational institution is not confined to purposes of conservation of language script or culture They can establish institutions to conserve their distinct language script or culture or for imparting general secular education or for both the purposes Counsel for the institutions contended that the preference given to minority candidates in their own educational institution is not violative of Article If an educational institution says yes to one candidate but says no to another candidate on ground of religion it amounts to discrimination on ground of religion The choice of institution provided in Article does not mean that the minorities could establish educational institution for the benefit of their own community people If such was the aim Article would have been differently worded and it would have contained the words for their own community In the absence of such words it is legally impermissible to construe the Article as conferring the right on the minorities to establish educational institution for their own benefit Article provides No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them It recognises the right of an individual not to be discriminated under the aegis of religion race caste language or any of them The discrimination based solely on the ground of a citizen particular religion race caste or having any particular language is absolutely prohibited in educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds Similarly the words any of them as used in Article are intended to give further emphasis that none of the grounds mentioned in the Article can be made the sole basis of discrimination The fact that Article applies to minorities as well as non minorities does not mean that it was intended to nullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in Article Article deals with non discrimination and it is available only to individuals There are many other instances including the Corsicans in France the Irish Catholics in Ulster the French Canadians in Quebec the Albanians in Kosovo Yugoslavia the Tamils in Sri Lanka the Islamic separatists in the Phillipines and the Animist and Christian minorities in southern Sudan It states In those States in which ethnic religious or linguistic minorities exist persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right in community with the other members of their group to enjoy their own culture to profess and practise their own religion or to use their own language There is no similar provision for other minorities to get grant from the <ORG> The State has no power to compel minority institutions to give up their rights under Article In the latter case this Court observed at that the regulation which may lawfully be imposed as a condition of receiving grant must be directed in making the institution an effective minority educational institution Such regulations must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution It is said that there is also restraint on collection of students fees Rights guaranteed under Article are available to any section of the citizens including the minorities while the rights guaranteed under Article are only available to the minorities based on religion or language The right of a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice under Article is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and facilitating the excellence of its standards This right is further subject to Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution which is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them In Re Kerala Education Bill case SCR it was pointed out at that the right in Article is subject to Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them In fact the issue which we are called upon to consider as to the right of minorities to prefer their community candidates in their educational institutions did not come up for consideration before the <ORG> We are on virgin soil not on trodden ground There are linkages and connections in the multi layered mix up There are concern and considerations underlying the provisions relating to minority rights There are shared understanding and expectations of the founding fathers We have been referred to the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> where the claim of <NAME> for regular admission was rejected by <ORG> in view of the preference sown in favour of certain disadvantaged candidates who were admitted under <ORG> The decision however is of little assistance to the case before us since the Constitution of the United States contains no provision similar to Article of our Constitution That is a necessary concomitant right which flows from the right to establish and administer educational institution in Article There is also a related right to the parents in the minority communities There is need to strike a balance between the two competing rights We must first take account of religion It recognises that the right to equality of opportunity includes the right of the under privileged to conditions comparable to or compensatory of those enjoyed by the privileged In <NAME> case the <ORG> order directing the minority run college to reserve per cent of seats for <ORG> nominees and permitting only per cent of seats for the management with a threat to withhold the grant in aid and recognition was Struck down by the Court as infringing the fundamental freedom guaranteed by Article Unlike Article it conferred a positive right on the Anglo Indian community to get grants from the <ORG> for their educational institutions but subject to the condition that at least forty per cent of annual admission were made available to members of other communities In the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs I had the advantage of going through the Judgment of my Learned brother <NAME> <NAME> with due deference I am unable to agree In view of the fact that <NAME> in his Judgment has set out the facts in detail I am mentioning such facts which are necessary in order to grapple with the questions raised in these cases i Admission to A Pass A Vocational Studies Courses be based on the merit of the percentage of marks secured by students in qualifying examination However the College may give weightage to marks obtained in one or more individual subjects in addition to the aggregate marks of the qualifying examination On June the University issued another Circular to Principals of all the colleges stating inter alia that admission to A Pass A Vocational Study Courses be based on the merit of percentage of marks secured by students in the qualifying examination However the <ORG> may give weightage to marks obtained in one or more individual subject in addition to the aggregate marks of the qualifying examination At this stage <NAME> a student seeking admission to the college filed a writ petition No of in <ORG> challenging the admission schedule prescribed by the <ORG> as well as the Policy of interview test prescribed by the college A Bench of two Judges of this Court by order dated th December held that <ORG> Delhi being a religious minority educational institution the right to administer the institution guaranteed under Article of the Constitution carries with it the right to regulate the admission of students of its own choice involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and therefore the petitions be laid before the Hon ble the Chief Justice of India for being placed for hearing before a Constitution Bench The next question which calls for consideration is whether the <ORG> was bound by the <ORG> Circulars dated th and th June The <ORG> has challenged these notifications as infringing the rights of the <ORG> of administering and managing the affairs as being violative of their right conferred under Article of the Constitution There is no allegation of any malafides in holding interviews and it is done to test the candidate knowledge of the subject together with his general awareness of the current problems The management of the <ORG> has the full say in the admission of students and it should be left free from control so that the minority institutions may admit the students in accordance with their ideas as to how the interests of the community in general and the institution in particular will be best served It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> as well as the students Union that the first Circular dated th June fixing the last date for receipt of applications for admission was done in order to ensure uniformity in the admission dates in all the affiliated colleges of the <ORG> and it was considered beneficial in the interest of students community as a whole The <ORG> has the right to regulate the standard of education and the admission of students in an educational institution is a part and parcel of such right <ORG> cannot adopt a different standard for admitting students under the guise of exclusive right of management given to a minority institution It has been further contended that once the <ORG> though being a minority institution gets grant in aid from the <ORG> it has to fall in line with the other non minority institutions in the matter of admitting the students and has to abide by a uniform rule prescribed by the Delhi <ORG> It has been further submitted on behalf of the college that the process of selection for admission by the college is not arbitrary The above procedure is applied without any discrimination in case of Christian as well as non Christian candidates or one who has stood first in the All India Examination or one who might be seeking admission on the basis of a sportsman These modalities of admission in the college have been followed for more than years and there is no reason to discontinue such a policy which has proved so valuable for such a long time and have stood the test of time The <ORG> has issued a general direction to all the colleges to admit students on the basis of marks secured in the qualifying examination In the present state of affairs existing in our country there is a great rush of students seeking admission to degree colleges after having passed the qualifying examination of Higher Secondary or There is a paucity of such colleges and the number of students being large there is a tough competition for getting admission in the college for higher studies Though a detailed reply has been given on behalf of the college justifying the method of interview but it would be important to note that it does not make a mention as to how much percentage of marks are kept for interview and how much for the qualifying examination According to the reply submitted by the <ORG> in this regard a list of potential suitable candidates called for interview is prepared which is normally on the basis of or for Arts and higher for Science students This method of interview adopted by the college goes to show that out of the candidates called for interview the final selection is based hundred per cent i solely on the basis of interview and at this stage it has not been shown as to how much weight percentage is given to the marks secured in the qualifying examination and how much to the interview proportionately Now for each one of these streams candidates are called for interview four or five times the number of available seats Thereafter if their selection is made dependent on interview then a highly meritorious student having secured even or more marks may not get admission while a student just getting marks near the cut off level can get admission in the college To illustrate if there are vacancies in the Science Stream and candidates are called for interview who have secured not less than marks in the qualifying examination students standing high in merit even at Nos to SO may not be selected and those standing at Nos to may get admission solely on the basis of interview SCR a Constitution Bench considered the question of selection by viva voce Some of the candidates whose applications for admission were rejected filed writ petitions under Article of the Constitution in <ORG> <ORG> after considering the various contentions raised by the petitioners held that the orders defining backwardness were valid and that the criteria laid down for interview of students were good but it held that <ORG> had abused the powers conferred upon it and on that finding set aside the interviews held and directed that the applicants shall be interviewed afresh in accordance with the scheme laid down by the Government Two of the petitioners came to this Court by filing appeals by special leave before this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellants that selection by interviews is inherently repugnant to the doctrine of equality embodied in Article of the Constitution for whatever may be the objective test laid down in the final analysis the award of marks is left to the subjective satisfaction of the selection committee and therefore it gives ample room for discrimination and manipulation It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the viva voce examination does not afford a proper criteria of assessment of the suitability of the candidates for admission and it is a highly subjective and impressionistic test where the result is likely to be influenced by many uncertain and imponderable factors such as predilections and prejudices of the interviewers his attitudes and approaches his preconceived notions and idiosyncrasies and it is also capable of abuse because it leaves scope for discrimination manipulation and nepotism which can remain undetected under the cover of an interview and moreover it is not possible to assess the capacity and calibre of a candidate in the course of an interview lasting only for a few minutes and therefore selections made on the basis of oral interview must be regarded as arbitrary and hence violative of Article The <ORG> observed That this criticism cannot be said to be wholly unfounded and it reflects a point of view which has certainly some validity All this shows that there is a great element of chance in the interview test This becomes a serious matter when the marks assigned to oral test constitute a high proportion of the total marks in the competition this <ORG> pointed out In the field of education there are divergent views as regards the mode of testing the capacity and calibre of students in the matter of admissions to colleges The marks allocated for the oral interview were as against allocated for the written test so that the marks allocated for the oral interview came to of the total number of marks taken into account for the purpose of making the selection The <ORG> in this regard held that there can be no doubt that having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated in the written test cannot be accepted by the <ORG> as free from the vice of arbitrariness The <ORG> then took notice of the fact that even in case for selection of candidates for the <ORG> <ORG> and the <ORG> where the personality of the candidate and his personal characteristics and traits are extremely relevant for the purpose of selection the marks allocated for oral interview are as against marks for the written examination constituting only of the total marks taken into consideration for the purpose of making the selection It would be important to note that even in <NAME> case supra their Lordships clearly took the view that having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated in the written test cannot be accepted by the <ORG> as free from the vice of arbitrariness It is further important to note that <ORG> is a constituent college of <ORG> and the University has issued the impugned notification dated th June by which a uniform rule has been made that admissions to all the affiliated and constituent colleges of the University should be made on the basis of marks secured in the qualifying examination According to the stand taken by the <ORG> itself only to of the students belonging to Christian community get admission and rest are students belonging to non Christian communities Thus we have to examine whether this method of viva voce adopted by the college can be justified or not which gives a clear free hand to the college management in admitting the students of their own choice out of to belonging to non Christian communities The method of interview in the present case results into discrimination and is violative of Article of the Constitution as it has no reasonable nexus with the object of affording an equality of opportunity of education at graduate level It has not been shown as to how the minority character of the College will be affected or prejudiced if students belonging to non Christian community are given admission solely on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination and not by interview It is understandable if some lee way is given to the students of <ORG> in respect of marks secured in qualifying examination or to make reservation of some seats to a reasonable extent for them If the candidates are called for interview on that basis it does not stand to reason as to how such marks are not treated as correct at the time of interview From the entire method of interview it appears that out of the candidates called for interview which is four or five times of the available seats the college on the basis of interview can select anyone out of them irrespective of their marks secured in the qualifying examination The Court in this regard further held that there can be no doubt that having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase the allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated in the written test cannot be accepted by the court as free from the vice of arbitrariness Thus the system of interview suffers from inherent weakness and if <ORG> in its wisdom has arrived to the conclusion that admission should be granted on the basis of marks secured in qualifying examination such decision taken by the <ORG> cannot be challenged on the ground of being illegal or arbitrary Those students who come from rural background or belong to weaker section of the society though more meritorious in academic distinction generally remain at disadvantage in the method of interview Though there is no allegation of any malafides against the college in holding interview but it cannot be forgotten that there is inherent weakness and infirmity in the system of interview itself in which subjective rather than objective satisfaction plays a major role The students who qualify for seeking admission in the degree course are generally of young age of to years and the personality of such students still remains to be developed and as such the only consideration for their admission to degree courses should be their academic performance in the qualifying examination No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Article RIGHT OF MINORITIES TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice A In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority referred to in Clause the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause The right conferred on minority to establish and administer educational institutions under Article of the Constitution is not absolute and is always subject to reasonable regulations However if such educational institution is receiving aid out of the <ORG> funds then it would be subject to the rigour of Clause of Article and it cannot deny admission on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The right conferred under Article is a general right granted to all minorities but if any educational institution established and administered by such minority also gets the benefit of grant in aid out of the <ORG> funds then it has to fall in line equally with all other educational institutions in the matter of admitting students in such institution and cannot prefer or reserve any seats for students of its own religion While Clause of Article protects the rights of a section of the citizens having a distinct language script or culture of its own the right conferred by Clause is an individual right given to the citizen as such and not as a member of any community So far as Clause of Article is concerned it grants a right of minority community to impart instruction to the children of its own community in institutions run by it and in its own language It confers two rights a the right to establish an institution the right to administer it It matters not if a single philanthropic individual with his own means funds the institution or the community at large contributes the funds There is however an exception to this and it is that the standards of education are not a part of management as such Therefore if university established syllabi for examination that must be followed subject however to special subjects which the institution may seek to teach and to a certain extent the <ORG> may also regulate the conditions of employment of teachers and the health and hygiene of students Now so far Clause of Article is concerned it is complementary to the right conferred by Clause of Article A minority can effectively conserve its distinct language script or culture only if it has the right to establish educational institutions of its choice The framers of the Constitution were fully knowing about the necessity of granting protection of interests of minorities but at the same time they wanted that if any educational institutions are run by receiving aid out of <ORG> funds then no citizen could be denied admission on grounds only of religion race caste language or any to them The rights conferred to the minorities under Article or Article are enabling ones while Clause of Article is a mandate that in the matter of admission in any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid all citizens would be treated equal and could not be denied admission on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The right guaranteed under Article is a special right which would prevail over the general right guaranteed to the minorities under Article It is a well known rule of construction that special law prevails over the general law as contained in the maxim generally specialibus non derogant If the contention raised on behalf of the college is accepted then it would necessarily involve the importation of the words for their own community in Article Clause of Article does not make any exception to any educational institution established by the minorities and it clearly provides in unmistakable terms that it applies to any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds whether run by a minority or majority at <NAME> observed as under A glance at the context and scheme of Part III of the Constitution would show that the Constitution makers did not intend to confer absolute rights on a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions No religious or linguistic minority establishing and administering an educational institution which receives aid from the state funds shall deny admission to any citizen to the institution on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The right to admit to an educational institution is admittedly comprised in the right to administer it Article enables the <ORG> to make any special provision for any advancement of any socially and educationally backward class citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of admission in the educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid from the <ORG> Article imposes a third restriction on the right in Article Obviously Article prohibits a religious minority establishing and administering an educational institution which receives aid or is recognised by the <ORG> from compelling any citizen reading in the institution to receive religious instruction against his wishes or if minor against the wishes of his guardian It cannot be disputed that the right of a religious minority to impart religious instruction in an educational institution forms part of the right to administer the institution There are also certain implied limitations on this right In the first place he contends that Article does not confer any fundamental right on all citizens generally but guarantees the right of citizens of minority groups by providing that they must not be denied admission to educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of the state funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them and he refers us to the marginal note to the Article It does not appear to have been specifically taken in the affidavits in opposition filed in <ORG> and there is no indication in the judgment under appeal that it was advanced in this form before <ORG> Article gives protection to any section of the citizens having a distinct language script or culture by guaranteeing their right to conserve the same Article secures to all minorities whether based on religion or language the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Nor do we see any reason to limit Article to citizens belonging to a minority group other than the section or the minorities referred to in Article or Article for the citizens who do not belong to any minority group may quite conceivably need this protection just as much as the citizens of other minority groups If it is urged that the citizens of the majority groups are amply protected by Article and do not require the protection of Article then there are several obvious answers to that argument The language of Article is wide and unqualified and may well cover all citizens whether they belong to the majority or minority group Article confers a special right on citizens for admission to educational institutions maintained or aided by the <ORG> To limit this right only to citizens belonging to minority groups will be to provide a double protection for such citizens and to hold that the citizens of the majority group have no special educational right in the nature of a right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of which they make contributions by way of taxes We see no cogent reason for such discrimination The right to get admission into any educational institution of the kind mentioned in Clause is a right which an individual citizen has as a citizen and not as a member of any community or class of citizen SCR at through <NAME> for the Court observed as under It will be observed that Article is wider than Article in that while any section of the citizens including the minorities can invoke the rights guaranteed under Article the rights guaranteed under Article are only available to the minorities based on religion or language A reading of these two articles would need us to concurred that a religious or linguistic minority has a right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice for effectively conserving its distinctive language script or culture which right however is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and facilitating the excellence of its standard This right is further subject to Clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution which is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of state funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them It is obvious that a minority community can effectively conserve its language script or culture by and through educational institutions and therefore the right to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice is a necessary concomitant to the right to conserve its distinctive language script or culture and that is what is conferred on all minorities by Article which has hereinbefore been quoted in full This right however is subject to Clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of state funds on grounds of religion race caste language or any of them It is said that an educational institution established by a minority community which does not seek any aid from the funds of the <ORG> need not admit a single scholar belonging to a community other than that for whose benefit it was a community other than that for whose benefit it was established seeks and gets aid from the <ORG> confers Article will preclude it from denying admission to members of the other communities on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them and consequently it will cease to be an educational institution of the choice of the minority community which established it There is no such limitation in Article and to accept this limitation will necessarily involve the addition of the words for their own community in the Article which is ordinarily nor permissible according to well established rules of interpretation To say that an institution which receives aid on account of its being a minority educational institution must not refuse to admit any member of any other community only on the grounds therein mentioned and then to say that as soon as such institution admits such an outsider it will cease to be a minority institution is tantamount to saying that minority institutions will not as minority institutions be entitled to any aid The whole edifice of our Constitution is based on secularism and so far as the minorities are concerned it was considered necessary that they should be allowed some rights in respect of establishing and administering educational institutions of their choice Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language script or culture of its own were conferred the right to conserve the same Education is a strong factor to unite the entire country and it was considered necessary that were any educational institution is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of <ORG> funds then the right of equality was guaranteed to every citizen in the matter of admission in such institution If the minorities based on religion or language wanted to run any educational institution without any aid out of <ORG> funds there was no restriction placed upon the minorities in the matter of admission in such educational institutions and they were free to admit students of their community The framers of the Constitution provided to conserve the distinct language script or culture of any section of citizens of this country and granted right to minorities to establish and administer educational institution of their choice While in case of institution maintained or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds no citizen shall be denied admission on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them under Clause of Article There is no impediment or obstruction in the right of minorities in imparting education in their own language and disseminating their culture by way of extra curricular activities and thus to conserve their own culture The only restriction is what is contained in Article which applies to any educational institution recognised by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds irrespective of the same being a minority or majority institution The fundamental right guaranteed by Article is not therefore to be extended so as to encroach upon other fundamental rights or to go contrary to the intentions of the founding fathers We have there provided also a further qualification that while it is free to give religious instruction in the institution and the grant made by the <ORG> shall not be a bar to the giving of such institution it shall not give instruction to or make it compulsorily upon the children belonging to other communities unless and until they obtain the consent of the parents of these children It performs two functions <NAME> On a point of clarification what about institutions and schools run by a community or a minority for its own pupils not a school where all communities are mixed but a school run by the community for its own pupils <NAME> If my friend Mr <NAME> will read the other article he will see that once an institution whether maintained by the community or not gets a grant the condition is that it shall keep the school open to all communities VII A He reaffirmed the freedom of the State to give or not to give aid to these schools when directly referring to draft Article which is the precurser of the present Articles and as follows I think another thing which has to be borne in reading Article is that it does not impose any obligation or burden upon the <ORG> There is no burden cast upon the <ORG> Therefore I do not think it is right on the part of any minority to depreciate the rights given in Article In this connection we have to hold the balance even between two different trends First of all we have to give to a large linguistic minorities their right to be educated especially in the primary stage in their own language Therefore we should not have rigid provisions by which every child is automatically protected in what may be called his mother tongue Wherever there are large number of children they should be given education primary education in their mother tongue While dealing with the question of the right guaranteed to the minority under Article and restriction put on such right under Article it cannot be said that we are on virgin soil as we have enough guidance provided in number of earlier Constitution decisions I have already quoted the relevant passages of these cases on the scope of Article and Article A conspectus of the entire scheme of Part HI of the Constitution clearly goes to show that the Constitution makers did not intend to confer absolute rights on a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions Right of admission is curtailed by Article which enables the <ORG> to make any special provision for any advancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of admission in the educational institutions receiving aid from the <ORG> Article imposes other restriction according to which any person attending any educational institution recognised or receiving any aid by the <ORG> shall not be required to take part in any religious instruction or to attend any religious worship imparted or conducted in such institution without the consent of such person or if such person is a minor without the consent of his guardian Thus even though a minority may have established an educational institution but if it receives aid or is recognised by the <ORG> it is bound by the mandate of Article The third restriction is put by Article according to which if such minority educational institution receives aid from the <ORG> funds then it cannot deny admission to any citizen on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Thus Articles and place express limitations on the right given to minorities in Article The golden rule of interpretation is that words should be read in the ordinary natural and grammatical meaning and the principle of harmonious construction merely applies the rule that where there is a general provision of law dealing with a subject and a special provision dealing with the same subject the special prevails over the general Thus in my humble view in the face of clear language of Article there is no scope for accepting the contention sought to be put on behalf of the college The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is that it does not rest on or proclaim its minority character <NAME> is his high sounding words of wisdom had told in <ORG> that first of all we have to give to a large linguistic minorities their right to be educated especially in the primary stage in their own language If we consider the case of <ORG> which may have been initially established to protect the interests of <ORG> in India feeling alien during British Rule have now completely assimilated and merged with the people of the locality and there does not appear any ground or justification to stall such process According to the stand taken by the college itself more than students belonging to non <ORG> are admitted in the college every year and this clearly shows that the college has already achieved the process of assimilation Another important question which arises for consideration is that if a minority educational institution getting grant in aid is held entitled to admit students of its own community then how much percentage can be considered as reasonable This Institution imparts education in several courses of study like Inter Agriculture Inter Home Science Indian Dairy Diploma IDD Sc in Agriculture Sc Home Economics Tech This Institution grants reservation to the extent of of its seals to students belonging to <ORG> In the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs
