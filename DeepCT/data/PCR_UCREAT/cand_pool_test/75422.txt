As for coloured leather it was contended that the exact scope of the expression used in entry iii of which re ferred to hides and skins whether in a raw or dressed state would have to be looked into The view of the <ORG> was that the expression hides and skins in the raw or dressed State refers at one end to the raw material obtained from the slaughtered or dead animals and at the other end to the tanned and finished material the expres sion therefore seems to include the other intermediate stages as well Dressing according to the authoritative interpretations would mean the conversion of tanned hides and skins by further suitable processing into leathers of different types which are ready for use Definitions in this regard show that hides and skins acquire the name of leather even if the hair or wool has not been removed therefrom as soon as they receive some treatment which prevents them from putrefaction after treat ment with water Glossary of terms relating to hides skins and leather published by <ORG> in Dictionary of Leather Terminology published by <ORG> Hides and skins are termed leather even as soon as the process of tanning is over and the danger of their putrefaction is put an end to The entry in the Central Sales Tax Act however includes within its scope hides and skins until they are dressed This represents the stage when they undergo the process of finishing and assume a form in which they can be readily utilised for manufacture of various commercial articles The statutory entry is comprehensive enough to include the products emerging from hides and skins until the process of dressing or finishing is done The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> All these civil appeals and special leave petitions raise a common question as to the interpre tation of an expression used in the Central Sales Tax Act view of the pendency of the appeals we grant leave in the spe cial leave petitions after condoning the delay in filing some of them and proceed to dispose of all the appeals by a common order If they are understood only as just skins as claimed there is no need to call them as splits in commercial parlance On the other hand on behalf of the assessees refer ence is made to certain circulars of the authorities which contain a contemporaneous exposition of the meaning of the entry in question reliance is placed on the decision of <ORG> to the contrary and it is emphasised that to say that the one item is called scraps and the other is called leather is not sufficient to take them out of the description hides and skins in a raw or dressed state So far as coloured leather is concerned according to the assessee the question is not whether the coloured skin is described as leather or whether it is a new product different from hides and skins as understood generally but what exactly is the scope of the expression used in entry iii of It takes in all categories of hides and skins right from their raw condition through various stages of their tanning and other processing right upto the stage when they receive the final finishing touches We have heard learned counsel on both sides at length and come to the conclusion that the assessees are entitled to the benefit of Ss and of the CST Act in respect of the two items in question There is no material to suggest that they are useless or worthless articles Turning to coloured leather we may at the outset refer to a very important circumstances referred to by the respondents When the CST Act came into force on a question was raised regarding the meaning of the expression hides and skins in dressed state used in The matter was referred to the leather development wing of <ORG> which gave the following opinion Hides and Skins are obtained from either slaughtered or dead animals Since tanneries are not always located very near the source of raw hides and skins the question of preserving them for a temporary period till they reach a tanning centre assumes importance Raw hides and skins are cured by either wet salting dry salting or drying In the cured state the raw materials can be preserved for a temporary period These tanned hides and skins are processed further to yield Dressed Hides and Skins which are ready for use Dressed or finished material could also be preserved almost indef initely From the above it will be seen that the expression Hides and Skins in the raw or dressed State refers at one end to the raw material obtained from the slaughtered or dead animals and at the other end to the tanned and finished material the expression therefore seems to include the other intermediate stages indicated in the previous paragraphs The statutory expression refers to hides and skins in a dressed state The guidelines issued for identification of finished leather for exports by <ORG> ISI refer to as many as operations or processes undergone during manufacture of finished leather but dressing is not one of them A glossary of terms relating to hides skins and leather published by the <ORG> in contains the following definitions CRUSTS Crust Leather Tanned hides and skins without any finish CURRYING A series of dressing and finishing processes applied to leather after tanning in the course of which appropriate amounts of oils and greases are incorporated in the leather to give it increased tensile strength flexibility and resisting properties DRESSED RIDES Tanned hides curried or other wise finished for various purposes such as belting harness and saddlery travel goods and for upholstery DRESSING LEATHER Vegetable tanned hides which may be dressed to suit the purpose for which they are to be used such as for harness saddlery and other mechanical purposes LEATHER The skin or hide of animals prepared by tanning which still retains its original fibrous structure more or less intact but from which hair or wool may or may not have been removed and which has been treated so as to be imputrescible even after treatment with water The earlier glossary of such terms published by <ORG> defines dressing as a general term for the series of processes employed to con vert certain rough tanned hides and skins and or crust leather into leather ready for use Also Leather is defined as a general term for hide or skin which still retains its original fibrous structure more or less intact and which has been treated so as to be imputrescible even after treatment with water Certain skins similarly treated or dressed and without the hair removed are termed fur The Dictionary of Leather Terminology published by <ORG> describes leather as the hide and skin of any animal or any portion of such skin when tanned tawed or otherwise dressed for use The above definitions show that hides and skins acquire the name of leather even if the hair or wool has not been removed therefrom as soon as they receive some treatment which prevents them from putrefaction after treatment with water <NAME> invited our attention apart from the contempo raneous exposition by the <ORG> to the findings of the <ORG> in this regard in an earlier case which had not been appealed against by the <ORG> of <ORG> under the word dress ex plains that the verb has various applications which can be deduced from its original meaning and that it is thus used not only of the putting on of the clothing but of the pre paring and finishing of leather Vol under the head leather details the various processes applied in the treatment of hides and skins at all stages pre tanning tanning and post tanning Dyeing or colouring is a process which follows tanning but precedes finishing i dress ing in order to make it suitable for the purpose for which it is required in commercial usage Part of the Wealth of India a publication of <ORG> dealing with leather under Industrial Products explains that hides and skins are liable to putrefaction and loss unless suitably treated and converted into leather Structurally hides and skins have a thick middle layer called corium which is converted to leather by tanning The operations involved in leather manufacture however fall into three groups Pre tanning operations include soaking liming deliming bating and pickling and post tanning operations are splitting and shaving neutralising bleaching dyeing fat liquoring and stuffing setting out samming drying staking and finishing These operations bring about chemical changes in the leather substance and influence the physical characteristics of the leather and different varieties of commercial leather are obtained by suitably adjusting the manufacturing operations These processes need not be gone into in detail but the passages relied upon clearly show that hides and skins are termed leather even as soon as the process of tanning is over and the danger of their putrefaction is put an end to The entry in the CST Act however includes within its scope hides and skins until they are dressed This as we have seen represents the stage when they undergo the process of finishing and assume a form in which they can be readily utilised for manufacture of various commercial articles The statutory entry is comprehensive enough to include the products emerging from hides and skins until the process of dressing or finishing is done We however make no order as to costs
