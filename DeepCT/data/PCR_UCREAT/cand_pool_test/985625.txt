These appeals arise from an order of <NAME> dismissing two connected petitions one to quash a penalty of Rs On the ground that the lorry attempted to transport without any sale bill or delivery note for the maida and khandasari sugar and on suspicion that there was an attempt at evasion of tax the Check post Officer by an order dated nd March confiscated the goods but gave an option to the appellant to pay a penalty of Rs The Check post Officer declined to accept the explanation of the appellant which was that he had purchased in Madras bags of atta bags of maida and in Nellore bags of khandasari sugar he being of the view as we said that there was really an attempt to suppress the sales of the maida and khandasari sugar under the cloak of the sale bill and delivery note for atta only Before <NAME> no attempt appears to have been made to challenge the validity of the penalty order on its merits and the learned Judge proceeded on the basis that in the exercise of writ jurisdiction the finding of the Check post Officer that the explanation of the appellant was not acceptable could not be revised <NAME> however felt that there was difference between Section and Section but he did not proceed to detail the difference As far as we are able to see except the difference which we mentioned there is no other existing between the language scheme object and effect of the two provisions That conclusion rested entirely on the scope and ambit of Entry in List II of the Constitution not on the factual position whether a sale or purchase had in a given case taken place The learned Judge as we have already mentioned was of opinion that there might be room to hold that the power to seize and confiscate goods was ancillary to the power to tax sales where a sale in a given case had taken place Nor the fact that a sale or purchase had taken place in a given case could make any difference to the invalidity of Section because that question depended on the actual language employed by the <ORG> That repugnancy is not solved by stating that the Check post Officer has found that there has been a sale or purchase in respect of the goods seized and confiscated Before we leave this case there is one other matter to which we would like to make reference That made all the difference as <ORG> itself pointed out because the main body of Sub section of Section as was held by <ORG> ought to be read as qualified by and in the sense of the two provisos to Section The appeals are allowed with costs throughout In the circumstances this will be taken note of and the respondents will pay the sale proceeds of the khandasari sugar to the appellant
