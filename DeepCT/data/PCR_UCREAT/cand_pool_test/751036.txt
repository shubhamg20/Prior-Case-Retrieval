These Writ Petitions under Article of the Constitution and Petitions for special leave to appeal under Article of the Constitution may be disposed of by a common order since they raise the same questions Clause of the Order made provision for the appointment of appointed retailers by the Collector for purposes of distributing foodstuffs under the <ORG> scheme In the Order as it stood originally there were provisions for appeal and revision against orders of suspension or revocation of the appointment of appointed dealers It was made clear that the agents were to have no right of legal ownership over the fair price shops If there was a cooperative society in an area and if such society expressed in writing its unwillingness to run the fair price shop the fair price shop could be allotted to other persons The vital change brought about by the amendment and the new scheme was the abolition of the system of appointed retailers and their replacement by fair price shops which were to be run by the agents appointed under the new scheme preference in the matter of appointment of agents being given to cooperative societies He sought to place reliance on the decision of this Court in <NAME> State of Assam <NAME> learned Counsel for the petitioners in the remaining cases made several submissions The wireless message dated October was without any legal authority as the Madhya Pradesh Foodstuffs Distribution Control Order had not even been amended by that date The amendment of the Madhya Pradesh Foodstuffs Distribution Control Order was invalid as it was not approved by a legislation within six months The amendment was invalid as the concurrence of the Central Government had not been obtained The amendment and the schemes were also invalid as they were not laid before the <ORG> There was a violation of the principles of natural justice as the amendment took away the right of the existing appointed retailers without hearing them The scheme was invalid as it was made pursuant to delegation of delegated powers There was an unlawful creation of monopoly in favour of cooperative societies We do not find any substance in any of the submissions made by the counsel <NAME> who presented the case for the State of Madhya Pradesh with ability and clarity drew our attention to the history of the scheme of distribution of foodstuffs in the State of Madhya Pradesh and pointed out with reference to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh how the well intentioned efforts of the Government to distribute foodstuffs in a fair and equitable manner were foiled and frustrated by the appointed retailers In the past few months there was a tremendous increase in flagrant violations of the Control Order There was considerable discussion in the course of which the Collectors of the Districts drew the attention of the Chief Minister to the plight of the poor consumers and the abuse to which the existing system had lent itself at the hands of the retailers The Original Order of was made by State Government pursuant to the powers delegated to it by <ORG> by notification No GSR dated November Merely because concurrence of <ORG> was needlessly obtained on an earlier occasion <ORG> was not obligated to obtain the concurrence of <ORG> whenever again there was an amendment of the Control Order An order made by the State Government in exercise of the powers delegated to it by <ORG> under Section is not required to be placed before <ORG> It was submitted that the amendment of the Control Order had the effect of doing away with appointed retailers and as this was being done without notice to them there was a violation of the principles of natural justice The amendment of the Control Order was a legislative function and there was therefore no question of affording an opportunity to those who were to be affected by it <ORG> Delhi and Ors We see no force in this submission The basic assumption underlying the argument was that the scheme was formulated by the <ORG> pursuant to some power purported to be vested in the <ORG> under the Madhya Pradesh Foodstuffs Distribution Control Order and that the <ORG> would otherwise have no power to formulate such a scheme There is no other provision in the Order authorising the setting up of fair price shops or the making of a scheme for setting up fair price shops Before we proceed to discuss the matter further we must refer to the statement made by the Learned Advocate General before <ORG> and repeated before us by the learned Counsel for the <ORG> that the expression cooperative society in Clause of the scheme meant only a consumers cooperative society and no other The learned Counsel for the petitioners urged that the scheme itself used the expression cooperative society and not consumers cooperative society and therefore there was no reason to think that the expression cooperative society was intended to be confined to consumers cooperative societies only We will proceed on the basis that the preference proposed to be given by the scheme in the matter of allotment of fair price shops was to consumers cooperative societies only The fundamental right of traders like the petitioners to carry on business in food stuffs was in no way affected No one could claim a right to run a fair price shop as an agent of the <ORG> If the <ORG> took a policy decision to prefer cooperative societies for appointment as their agents to run fair price shops in the light of the frustrating and unfortunate experience gathered in the last two decades we do not see how we can possibly hold that there was any discrimination An examination of what was decided in that case shows that it does not help the petitioners The Government issued directions to all licensing authorities that rights of monopoly procurement had been given to <ORG> Instead of doing that it passed an order in accordance with the instructions given to it on behalf of <ORG> instructions which appear to us to be not in consonance with Sub clause of Clause because Sub clause contemplates a preference to cooperative societies in certain circumstances but not a monopoly in their favour It is apparent that the question before us is altogether different from the question considered by the <ORG> in <NAME> case In that case the Control Order prescribed the matters to be considered in deciding whether a licence should be granted or not On the other hand there are several observations in the judgment which are in fact opposed to the contention of the petitioners of the Essential Commodities Act Sub clause of Clause we have already stated enables the licensing authority to give preference to a cooperative society in certain circumstances but it does not create a monopoly in favour of cooperative societies
