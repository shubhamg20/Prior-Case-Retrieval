That order however was revoked in November and his services terminated forthwith by notice entitling him to one month salary In this appeal by special leave it was contended that the appellant was entitled to the protection of Articles and of the Constitution that though his order of termination was innocuous the setting in which it has been made clearly makes it an order of dismissal punitive in character and that as his service was determined by the order attaching stigma the appellant was entitled to a hearing commensurate with rules of natural justice and in the absence of the opportunity of being heard the order was liable to be quashed Since both in regard to a temporary employee or an officiating employee in a higher post such an assessment would be necessary merely because the appropriate authority proceeds to make an assessment and leaves a record of its views the same would not be available to be utilised to make the order of termination following such assessment punitive in character After such steps have been taken the employer appropriate authority decides not to continue the departmental proceedings but makes an order terminating the service Both under the contract of service as also the Service Rules governing him the employer had the right to terminate his services by giving him one month notice He is therefore placed under suspension with immediate effect Underlinings are ours On the st of February the order of suspension was A revoked and on th of February the impugned order terminating his services being to the following effect was passed The undersigned hereby gives notice to <NAME> Deputy Production Manager <ORG> <ORG> Prataapgarh Salon Rai Bareilly that his services are no more required and his service will be deemed to be terminated from receipt of this notice by him The appellant challenged the order of termination of his service before <ORG> but <ORG> declined to interfere by holding that the termination was not punitive and the question of breach of principles of natural justice did not arise It is not disputed that the employer Corporation is State within the meaning of Article yet it has not been contended and rightly that the protection of Article of the Constitution is avilable to the employees of the Corporation It cannot be disputed that temporary service can be terminated by notice The appointing authority may at any time during the pendency of the temporary tenure terminate the services of a temporary employee by giving him one month notice or emoluments for such lesser period by which the notice falls short of one month The temporary employee on his part shall have the option of quitting service by giving one month notice to the appointing authority or paying to the <ORG> an amount equal to his one month pay a Constitution Bench of this Court stated This use of expression terminate or discharge is not conclusive whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind herinbefore referred to If the case satisfied either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service or the reversion to his substantive rank must be regarded as a reduction in rank and if the requirements of the rules and Article which give protection to Government servant have not been complied with the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the constitutional right of the servant After indicating approval <NAME> as he then was spoke for <ORG> thus It is well known that <ORG> does not terminate nate the services of a public servant be he even a temporary servant without reason nor is it usual for <ORG> to reduce a public servant in rank without reason even though he may be holding the higher rank only tempoarily In that case there is nothing further to be said and his services terminate when the post comes to an end But even where it is intended to take action by way of punishment what usually happens is that something in the nature of what may be called a preliminary enquiry is first held in connection with the alleged misconduct or unsatisfactory work It is usual when such a preliminary enquiry makes out a prima facie case against the servant concerned that charges are then framed against him and he is asked to show cause why disciplinary action be not taken against him This is what is known as a formal departmental enquiry into the conduct of a public servant Generally therefore a preliminary enquiry is usually held to determine whether a prima facie case for a formal departmental enquiry is made out and it is very necessary that the Two should not be confused Even where <ORG> does not intend to take action by way of punishment against a temporary servant on a report of bad work or misconduct a preliminary enquiry is usually is held to satisfy <ORG> that there is reason to dispense with the services of a temporary employee or to revert him to his substantive post for as we have said already <ORG> does not usually take action of this kind without any reason Therefore when a preliminary enquiry of this nature is held in the case of a temporary employee or a <ORG> servant holding a higher rank temporarily it must not be confused with the regular departmental enquiry which generally follows such a preliminary enquiry when the <ORG> decides to frame charges and get a departmental enquiry made in order that one of the three major punishments already indicated may be inflicted on the government servant Therefore so far as the preliminary enquiry is concerned there is no question of its being governed by Article for that enquiry is really for the satisfaction of government to decide whether punitive action should be taken or action should be taken under the contract or the rules in the case of a temporary government servant or a servant holding higher rank temporary to which he has no right Even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may in the facts and circumstances of the case establish that an enquiry into allegations of serious and grave character of misconduct involving stigma has been made in infraction of the provision of Article An order terminating the services of a temporary servant or probationer under the Rules of employment and without anything more will not attract Article Indeed we do not think that the principles of law declared and applied so often have really changed But the application of the same law to the differing circumstances and facts of various cases which have come up to this court could create the impression some times that there is some conflict between decisions of this Court It is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar One additional or different fact can make a word of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts If the delinquency of the officer in temporary service is taken as the operative motive in terminating the service the order is not considered as punitive while if the order of termination is founded upon it the termination is considered to be a punitive action Since both in regard to a temporary employee or an officiating employee in a higher post such an assessment would be necessary merely because the appropriate authority proceeds to make an assessment and leaves a record of its views the same would not be available to be utilised to make the order of termination following such assessment punitive in character We do not think there is any justification in the contention of the appellant that once such an assessment is recorded the order of termination made soon thereafter must take the punitive character After such steps have been taken the employer appropriate authority decides not to continue the departmental proceedings but makes an order terminating the service as has been done in this case Unless the termination is ordered because there is no need for the post in the absence of reasons for termination the action is open to challenge as arbitrary particulary when other similarly situated employees are continued in service No straight jacket test can be laid down to distinguish the two and whether motive has become the foundation has to be decided by the court with reference to the facts of a given case It has also not been denied that both under the contract of service as also the Service Rules governing him the employer had the right to terminate his services by giving him one month notice The amount of Rs as indicated above may be paid to the appellant within one month from today
