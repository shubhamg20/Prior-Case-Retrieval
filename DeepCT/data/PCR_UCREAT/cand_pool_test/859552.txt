These two appeals have been filed by <ORG> against the common award of <ORG> Coimbatore in respect of two claims made by two sets of individuals in respect of two deaths caused by the same accident They also contended that in any event the compensation claimed in both the cases was excessive <ORG> after going through the evidence both oral and documentary in considerable detail came to the conclusion that the accident which resulted in the death of the two deceased was due to the rash and negligent driving of the car by the said <NAME> and that the deceased were not guilty of any contributory negligence However it took the view that as the driver had a valid licence earlier and had not been disqualified from driving or holding a driving licence and as Section ii of the Motor Vehicles Act had not been incorporated However we are of the view that the <ORG> has come to the right conclusion Section ii enables the insurance company to avoid the contract of insurance if a condition is incorporated in the policy to the effect that the vehicle should be run only by a person holding a licence But in this case one of the conditions incorporated in the policy is that the vehicle should not be driven by any person who is not duly licenced or by a person who has been disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification It is therefore clear that the appellant has not chosen to take advantage of the provision contained in Section ii by incorporating a Suitable provision in the insurance policy excluding the use of the vehicle by all non licensees There are also two decisions of this Court which also laid down the same principle has taken the view under similar circumstances that Section ii cannot be so interpreted as to exonerate <ORG> from its liability where it specifically has undertaken to cover liability in respect of a person who at the time of the accident had no effective licence but who had held a licence and was not disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence
