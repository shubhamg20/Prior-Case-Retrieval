As to the issue whether the plaintiff suit was barred by the sixty years rule of limitation and as to the other points of law raised by the appeal the judgment of the <ORG> after discussing the documentary evidence as to the original mortgage of and its bearing upon the question whether that mortgage was redeemable within nine years or only after the expiration of the period continued as follows In that case the stipulation in the mortgage deed was that the mortgagor would pay the debt within ten years and redeem the mortgaged property and it was held that a suit for redemption instituted within the ten years was premature the mere use of the word within not being a sufficient indication of an intention that the mortgagor might redeem in a less period than ten years Section prescribes in the case of a usufructuary mortgage that the mortgagor has a right to recover possession of the property where the mortgagee is authorized to pay himself from the rents and profits the interest of the mortgage debt when the term if any prescribed for the payment of the mortgage money has expired and the mortgagor pays or tenders to the mortgagee the principal money On the evidence afforded by the proceeding before the Collector we are of opinion that the agreement of the parties was that the advance made by <NAME> was to be left outstanding for a period of nine years and that within that period the mortgagee could not foreclose the mortgage nor could the mortgagors redeem it He also seems to hold that it was optional with the mortgagor to redeem whenever he pleased and that therefore the period of limitation ran from the date of the mortgage After referring to some rulings he says Having regard to the terms of the mortgage in this case and to the plaintiffs allegations I am bound to hold following the above rulings that the period of limitation in this case will run from the date of the mortgage viz The time began to run we think from the expiration of the term of nine years and the mere fact that the plaintiffs alleged that the mortgage debt was satisfied within this period does not affect the question These objections were disallowed and on the th of September the plaintiffs were allowed to withdraw their claim for mesne profits with liberty to sue again in respect of such profits There are two answers to the contention of Mr <NAME> The first is that the suit is for redemption and that the mere fact that the plaintiffs claimed in the suit payment of any sum which might be found to be due to them on the taking of the accounts a relief to which they would be entitled under the ordinary decree for redemption did not alter the nature of the suit so as to necessitate the payment of an additional fee Another answer is that Section of the Civil Procedure Code empowered the <ORG> to allow the plaintiffs to abandon part of their claim with liberty to bring a fresh suit in respect of the part so abandoned if it was satisfied that the suit must fail by reason of a formal defect or that there were sufficient grounds for permitting them to abandon part of their claim This section was intended to meet amongst other cases a case in which there had been an improper valuation of the stamp I A dealing with the powers conferred by this section observes at page There is a proceeding in these <ORG>s called a non suit which operates as a dismissal of the suit without barring the right of the party to litigate the matter in a fresh suit but that seems to be limited to cases of misjoinder either of parties or of the matters in contest in the suit to cases in which a material document has been rejected because it has not borne the proper stamp and to cases in which there has been an erroneous valuation of the subject of the suit We now come to the last question discussed in the appeal On the th of June a decree for foreclosure was passed and on the nd of July according to the practice which then prevailed a suit was brought for recovery of possession against <NAME> and a decree was obtained therein and on the nd of August <NAME> obtained delivery of possession On the part of the appellants Mr <NAME> strenuously contended that Article did not apply to a case of an involuntary sale and that the foreclosure proceedings taken by <NAME> did not constitute him a purchaser within the meaning of the article and that if this be granted the defendants are forced to rely on the mortgage of and that inasmuch as that mortgage was a mortgage without possession the defendants do not come within the purview of the article He also relied on the decision in <NAME> Sheikh <NAME> I Bom in which it was held that a person purchasing or taking a mortgage from a mortgagee believing that he is getting a good title must have possession of the property for the statutory period in order to protect the transaction as against the original mortgagor under Article I A in which their Lordships of <ORG> discussed the meaning of the word purchaser as used in Section of Act XIV of which closely corresponds with Article of Schedule II to the Limitation Act of and point out that upon the true interpretation of their Lordships language a person who purchases from a mortgagee having reasonable grounds for believing and believing that his vendor had power to convey to him an absolute interest and not merely the interest of a mortgagee was a purchaser within the meaning of the article <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> says Here no doubt we have a mulgeni lease and not an absolute alienation but in principle this involves no distinction for even if Article be treated as the governing article a mulgeni lease is a purchase pro tanto of the interests thereby assured We are supported by the foregoing authorities in the view which we take namely that a person who bona fide purchases from a mortgagee in possession what is represented to him and what he believes to be the absolute interest is entitled to the protection afforded by Article In the case before us we find that <NAME> held himself out as the absolute owner of the five villages which were mortgaged to <NAME> and we have no reason to suspect that <NAME> had any reason to doubt the representation which was made to him by his mortgagor We find that <NAME> obtained possession of the mortgaged property on the nd of August and that he and his successors in title have been in uninterrupted possession of it from that time to the present which decided that a person purchasing or taking a mortgage from a mortgagee believing that he is getting a good title must have possession of the property for the statutory period in order to validate the transaction as against the original mortgagor under Article If the purchaser is a purchaser from a trustee the property cannot be followed into his hands as it may be under Section of the Limitation Act unless he have possession In view of the conclusions at which we have arrived upon the several points raised before us in this appeal we are prepared to give a decree to the plaintiffs for redemption of the seven villages included in the mortgage which did not pass to <NAME> under his mortgage upon payment of any sum which may be due after taking an account by them to the mortgagees on foot of the mortgage of and to dismiss the suit as regards the other five villages
