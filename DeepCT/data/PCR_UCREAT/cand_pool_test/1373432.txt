These are two appeals for which the appellant Mrs <NAME> obtained special leave from His Majesty in Council against two decisions of <ORG> at Madras They arise in the following circumstances There are in India two legislative Acts of the Governor General of India in Council relating to printing one being The Printing Presses and Newspapers Act No XXV of Under the second Act Section Sub section the person making the declaration is required to deposit before a Magistrate in money or in certain securities a sum not being leas than Rs But the Magistrate may for special reasons which ho is to record dispense with the deposit and he has certain powers of canceling or varying any order made under this sub section By Section of the Act the local Government when it appears to it that any printing press in respect of which any security has been deposited is used for the purpose of printing any newspaper which contains words signs or visible representations of a nature deemed to be objectionable under the detailed provisions of the section which will be hereinafter specifically set forth may by notice in writing addressed to the keeper of the press declare the security and all copies of the newspaper wherever found forfeited to His Majesty and after the expiry of ten days from the date of the issue of the notice of forfeiture the declaration required of every keeper of a press is to be deemed to be annulled By Section Any person having an interest in any property in respect of which an order of forfeiture has been made under Section or under certain other sections not material to the present Appeal may within two months from the date of such order apply to <ORG> to set aside such order on the ground that the newspaper in respect of which the order was made did not contain any words signs or visible representations of the nature described in Section Sub section On the nd December the appellant being the owner and keeper of a printing press and printer and publisher of a newspaper called at that time and thereafter New India made the declaration required of her under the Act of and the Magistrate before whom it was made using the power of dispensation given to him by Section of the Act of thought fit to dispense with the deposit of the security which under the provisions of the same section she would otherwise have had to give On the th May the appellant received a notice from the Magistrate dated the nd May in which it was stated that he under Sub section of Section cancelled the order dispensing with the security and required her within fourteen days to deposit Rs On the th August she was served with an order dated the th August and made by the Governor in Council reciting that twenty passages published in the newspaper and identified in the order were of the nature described in Sub section of Section of the Act of and declaring that the security which the appellant had deposited and all copies of New India wherever found were to be forfeited to the <ORG> The Statute contemplates that in ordinary cases security shall be deposited and the only duty of the Magistrate is to fix the amount having regard to the two limits and to receive it But it is well settled that there is no magic in words of proviso and that the plain meaning must be given to the words of the legislature and those words enable the Magistrate to cancel or vary any order made under the sub section which should mean among other orders of dispensation If the Magistrate having fixed the minimum security may vary his order by imposing the maximum there is no reason why he should not as time goes on think fit to require security when at first he thought fit to require none Under the second sub section a power of requiring a deposit where none up to that moment had been required is given in certain cases to the local Government and it is natural to suppose that what the local Government may do in a proper case under Sub Section may be done in a proper case by the Magistrate under Sub section There must be a deposit unless there is a positive order of dispensation the canceling of an order fixing the deposit at say Rs would leave the keeper of the printing press in the position of having to apply to the Magistrate to make some further order either fixing a new sum or dispensing with any and till such new order had been made and complied with the Keeping of the printing press would apparently be an unlawful act so that the cancellation of the order fixing the deposit at Rs It is next contended on behalf of the appellant that the act of the Magistrate in canceling the dispensation was a judicial order and was bad because she was given no opportunity of being heard before an adverse order was made against her Those to whom power was entrusted by the Act of were any person exercising the full powers of a Magistrate and were to include Magistrates of Police and Justices of the Peace It is only in one case that he is to record his reasons and that is when there is a departure from the normal and the object of recording them is as the Officiating Chief Justice rightly said for the information of his superiors in the <ORG> As to certiorari it was contended on behalf of the respondent in <ORG> that there is no power in <ORG> to issue a writ of certiorari or alternatively that the provisions of Section forbid recourse to this writ in cases which come under the Press Act As to the first point it would seem that at any rate the there <ORG> of Calcutta Madras and Bombay possessed the power of issuing this writ Section re the Justices of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Bombay Knapp But assuming that the power to issue the writ remains and that it might be exercised notwithstanding the existence of procedure by way of revision Section has still to be considered shall as against all persons be conclusive evidence that the forfeiture therein referred to has taken place and no proceeding purporting to be taken order this Act shall be called in question by any Court except <ORG> on such application as aforesaid and no civil or criminal proceeding except as provided by this Act shall be instituted against any person for anything done or in good faith intended to be done under this Act As to this section it was contended on behalf of the appellant that as the writ of certiorari was not in terms said to be taken away the right to it remained notwithstanding the very express but still general words of this section However that might be according to English Law where there is no such revision procedure as in India their Lordships see no reason for narrowing the express words of the Indian Act Even were it to be said that the order was of that quasi judicial kind to which certiorari has sometimes been applied in England or in India the Press Act may quite reasonably have intended to take it away and there is no reason why full effect should not be given to its language The order of <ORG> dismissing this application was therefore right and the appeal from it must be dismissed The power of the local Government to make a forfeiture under Section no doubt depends upon there being a deposit to forfeit But at the time the order was made th August there had been in fact a deposit since th June and the appellant had taken no steps to get herself relieved from the order made on the nd May directing the deposit or to get it back Even were it contended that the deposit ought to be regarded as having been so unwarrantably exacted that it ought to count as non existent there was nothing to show that the local Government was or ought to have been aware of this Lastly the appellant made no application by way of certiorari or otherwise to quash the declaration of forfeiture and the only way in which it was attacked was by using the procedure under Section which as pointed out in <ORG> is available only for one purpose that is of showing on the merits that the published articles were not deserving of forfeiture Section Sub section of the Indian Press Act is in so far as it is material in the following terms Whenever it appears to <ORG> that any printing press in respect of which any security has been deposited as required by Section is used for the purpose of printing or publishing any newspaper book or other document containing any words signs or visible representations which are likely or may have a tendency directly or indirectly whether by inference suggestion allusion metaphor implication or otherwise to bring into hatred or contempt His Majesty or the Government established by law in British India or the administration of justice in British India or any Native Prince or Chief under the suzerainty of His Majesty or any class or section of His Majesty subjects in British India or to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the said Government or any such Prince or Chief or to encourage or incite any person to interfere with the administration of the law or with the maintenance of law and order <ORG> may by notice in writing to the keeper of such printing press stating or describing the words signs or visible representations which in its opinion are of the nature described above declare the security deposited in respect of such press and all copies of such newspaper book or other document wherever found to be forfeited to His Majesty EXPLANATION IIn Clause the expression disaffection includes disloyalty and all feeling of enmity Comments expressing disapproval of the measures of the <ORG> or of any such Native Prince or Chief as aforesaid with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means or of the administrative or other action of the <ORG> or of any such Native Prince or Chief or of the administration of justice in British India without exciting or attempting to excite hatred contempt or disaffection do not come within the scope of Clause The language is not precisely the same but there is the same delicate balancing of two important public considerations the undesirability of anything tending to excite sedition or to excite strife between classes and the undesirability of preventing any bona fide argument for reform But assuming this the appellant remains face to face with the difficulty that there is language used in certain of the articles which may legitimately be construed as tending by inference or suggestion to excite hatred or contempt in such a fashion that it may become personal As to Clause the majority of the Judges in <ORG> were brought to the conclusion that the attacks on Anglo India or Anglo Indians or the bureaucracy as the case may be were calculated whatever might have been the primary object of the writer to bring into hatred or contempt persons forming a class or section of His Majesty subjects namely English Civil Servants in India in some cases Englishmen in India generally There were also as already stated findings by <NAME> and <NAME> bringing some of the articles under Clause a clause which it should be noted is not qualified by any explanation Upon careful perusal of the several judgments their Lordships find that weight has been properly given to the several portions of the section There remains only the question of application in detail of the principles of the Law to the language of the various articles Their Lordships will therefore humbly recommend His Majesty that both these appeals should be dismissed with costs
