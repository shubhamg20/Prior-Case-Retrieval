These cases have come up on a reference to us made by the Honourable single Judge in view of a conflict of decisions between single Judges in respect of the matter involved in the present revisions Before we refer to the conflicting decisions of this <ORG> on the two items involved in the revisions we may refer to the relevant notifications under Sections and A There is another notification regarding milk products of th July being Notification No ST II ll dated th July which we will refer to after referring to the notification issued under Section A which made ice cream and lassi taxable under the notification issued under that section As far back as this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Commissioner of Sales Tax UPTC had held that lassi was a milk product and as such was exempt from sales tax in view of the notification issued under Section of the Act However there was no direct decision on the question as to whether ice cream is a milk product until UPTC that ice cream was a milk product and as such was exempt from tax in view of the notifications issued under Section of the Act which have been adverted to earlier However in spite of these notifications under Section as referred to earlier <ORG> issued the notifications dated st December th November and th May under Section A of the Act specifically referring to ice cream and lassi and making them taxable under those notifications Thus it will be seen while on the one hand there were existing notifications under Section of the Act exempting milk products one such notification being of the st December On this very date there was a notification under Section A imposing tax on ice cream and lassi under Section A The State Government was merrily issuing notifications under Section A making ice cream and lassi taxable under that provision These incongruous notifications issued under Sections and A invited a rift in judicial opinion which did occur We then come to the year in which the difference of opinion surfaced on account of the notification of st December issued under Section A page infra ATJ one of us took the view that the notification of st December superseded all earlier notifications and as such ice cream was taxable under the notification under Section A We feel that in case the State Government had been more alert in realising the repercussions of issuing notifications under Section A while milk products including ice cream and lassi were exempt under the notification issued under Section the divergence of opinions which has led to this reference would not have occurred Now the question is as to whether the notifications under Section prevail over the notifications issued under Section A It is apparent that while on the one hand Section A brings to tax ice cream and lassi sold to consumers the notifications issued under Section grant exemptions to milk products which on judicial interpretations include ice cream and lassi Now an exemption can be granted only in respect of a matter which is liable to tax It would be profitable to quote the relevant passage from the decision of Bhagwati There is a broad distinction between the provisions contained in the statute in regard to the exemptions of tax or refund or rebate of tax on the one hand and in regard to the non liability to tax or non imposition of tax on the other In the former case but for the provisions as regards the exemptions or refund or rebate of tax the sales or purchases would have to be included in the gross turnover of the dealer because they are prima facie liable to tax and the only thing which the dealer is entitled to in respect thereof is the deduction from the gross turnover in order to arrive at the net turnover on which the tax can be imposed In the latter case the sales or purchases are exempted from taxation altogether The legislature cannot enact a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax thereupon and they are not liable to any such imposition of tax If they are thus not liable to tax no tax can be levied or imposed on them and they do not come within the purview of the Act at all The very fact of their nonliability to tax is sufficient to exclude them from the calculation of the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on which sales tax can be levied or imposed It would thus appear that transactions or sales which enjoy exemptions have to be included in the gross turnover but they are exempted when the net turnover is calculated In the present case as there are notifications under Section of the Act even though ice cream and lassi have been made taxable under Section A on account of the notifications issued under Section the turnover of these items could not be included in the net taxable turnover Thus the view taken by the revising authority that the sale of ice cream was not taxable in view of the exemption granted under the notification issued under Section in respect of milk products appears to be correct The parties will bear their own costs
