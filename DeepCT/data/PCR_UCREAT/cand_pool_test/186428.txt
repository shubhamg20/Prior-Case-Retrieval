The contracts were of three types one was contract on wage basis commonly known as wage contract which was given by auctioning the blazes to the person who was prepared to undertake the work of extraction and collection of resin at the lowest rates of labour charges and in such contract the entire resin extracted and collected by the contractor would belong to the <ORG> and the contractor would be entitled only to the wage or labour charges for extraction and collection of resin the second type of contract was on the basis of royalty without load and under this contract which was given by auction stipulating for payment of royalty per blaze the entire resin extracted and collected by the contractor would belong to him and he would be free to sell or process it as he likes the third type of contract was on the basis of royalty with load and under this contract which was also given by auction the royalty was payable per blaze and out of resin extracted and collected by the companies a certain part would have to be surrendered to the <ORG> while the balance would remain with the contractor There were certain forests in Resin and Ramban Division of the <ORG> which was out of access on account of their distance from the roads and so were some forests in the Poonch Division near the line of actual control and there were blazes situated in the lower regions of inaccessible forests and no contractors could be found for taking tapping contracts even on the basis of royalty without load for blazes in the higher regions of the inaccessible areas These decisions taken at the meeting on th December were confirmed at a subsequent meeting which took place between Forest Minister the Forest Secretary the Chief Conservative Forest Officer and other Forest Officers on th December The petitioners thereupon challenged this order made by the <ORG> <ORG> under Article of the Constitution on the grounds namely a that the order is arbitrary mala fide and not in public interest inasmuch as a huge benefit has been conferred on the nd respondents at the cost of the <ORG> the order creates monopoly in favour of the nd respondent who is a private party and constitutes unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners to carry on tapping contract business under Art There are two limitations imposed by law which structure and control the discretion of the <ORG> in this behalf The constitutional power conferred on the <ORG> cannot be exercised by it arbitrarily or capriciously or in an unprincipled manner it has to be exercised for the public good Every activity of the <ORG> has a public element in it and it must therefore be informed with reason and guided by public interest If the <ORG> awards a contract or leases out or otherwise deals with its property or grants any other largess it would be liable to be tested for its validity on the touch stone of reasonableness and public interest and if it fails to satisfy either test it would be unconstitutional and invalid Article strikes at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and since the principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as philosophically an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness is projected by this article it must characterise every governmental action whether it be under the authority of law or in exercise of executive power without making of law in the full plenitude of its activist magnitude as discovered by <NAME> case insists that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law and such procedure must be reasonable fair and just It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the <ORG> cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the <ORG> such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest The <ORG> therefore cannot for example give a contract or sell or lease out its property for a consideration less than the highest that can be obtained for it unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so These considerations are referred to only illustratively for there may be an infinite variety of considerations which may have to be taken into account by the <ORG> in formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of various considerations which have weighed with the <ORG> in taking a particulars action that the <ORG> would have to decide whether the action of the <ORG> is reasonable and in public interest A But one basic principle which must guide the <ORG> in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the <ORG> action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the <ORG> by proper and adequate material The <ORG> cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the <ORG> is unreasonable or without public interest because there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the <ORG> in taking action and therefore the <ORG> would not strike down governmental action as invalid on this ground unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest It is imperative in a democracy governed by the rule of law that governmental action must be kept within the limits of the law and if there is any transgression the <ORG> must be ready to condemn it It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in many countries that the legislative check is getting diluted it is left to the <ORG> as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and in this task the <ORG> must not finch or falter This ground of invalidity namely that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking the quality of public interest is different from that of mala fides though it may in a given case furnish evidence of mala fides The law is now well established that the <ORG> need not deal with anyone but if it does so it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure A The impugned order neither created any monopoly in favour of the second respondent nor imposed unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioner to carry on tapping business under Article The <ORG> also could not award a contract simpliciter for tapping on the basis of royalty with or without load because as a matter of policy with a view to encouraging industrialisation the <ORG> did not want resin to go outside its territories but wanted it to be used only for the purpose of feeding industries set up within the <ORG> and even if a condition could legitimately be imposed on the contractor that he should sell the resin extracted and retained by him only to industries within the <ORG> it would be difficult to ensure observance of such condition and moreover the object of the <ORG> to make resin available to the local industries at a reasonable price might be frustrated because the contractor taking advantage of scarcity in supply of resin might and in all probability would try to extract a much higher price from the industries needing resin The <ORG> may choose to do so if it thinks fit and in a given situation it may even turn out to be advantageous for the <ORG> to do so but if any private party comes before the <ORG> and offers to set up an industry the <ORG> would not be committing breach of any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates which such party and agrees to provide resources and other facilities for the purpose of setting up the industry A JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos of of the Constitution raise questions of some importance in the field of constitutional law but they are not exact questions which can be divorced from the facts giving rise to them and in order to resolve them satisfactorily it is necessary to state the facts in some detail Though the petitioners in the two writ petitions are different the respondents are the same and the same Order of the State of Jammu and Kashmir is challenged in both the writ petitions Hence whatever we say in regard to the first writ petition applies equally in regard to the second The validity of the Order has been challenged on various grounds which we shall presently set out but in order to understand and appreciate these grounds it is necessary to state briefly the circumstances in which the Order came to be passed by <ORG> The contracts were of three types One was contract on wage basis commonly known as wage contract which was given by auctioning the blazes to the person who was prepared to undertake the work of extraction and collection of resin at the lowest rates of labour charges and in such contract the entire resin extracted and collected by the contractor would belong to the <ORG> and the contractor would be entitled only to the wage or labour charges for extraction and collection of resin The second type of contract was on the basis of royalty without load and under this contract which was again given by auction stipulating for payment of royalty per blaze the entire resin extracted and collected by the contractor would belong to him and he would be free to sell or process it as he liked Now there were certain forests in Reasi and Ramban Divisions of the <ORG> which were difficult of access on account of their distance from the roads and so were some forests in the Poonch Division near the line of actual control These decisions taken in the meeting of th December were confirmed at a subsequent meeting which took place between the Forest Minister the Forest Secretary the Chief Conservator of Forests and other forest officers on th December It appears that <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the association came to know sometime in October that the nd respondents had approached <ORG> and there was a proposal to allot to them certain resin coupes on royalty system of years on the basis that they would install a factory for manufacture of resin and turpentine at Jammu with sizable investment <NAME> There were in the main three grounds on which the validity of the order was assailed on behalf of the petitioners We shall examine these grounds in the order in which we have set them out There are two limitations imposed by law which structure and control the discretion of the <ORG> in this behalf The constitutional power conferred on the <ORG> cannot be exercised by it arbitrarily or capriciously or in and unprincipled manner it has to be exercised for the public good Every activity of the <ORG> has a public element in it and it must therefore be informed with reason and guided by public interest It has been laid down by this Court in <NAME> <ORG> of Tamil Nadu and <NAME> case supra that Art in the full plenitude of its activist magnitude as discovered by <NAME> case insists that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law and such procedure must be reasonable fair and just Any action taken by the Government with a view to giving effect to any one or more of the Directive Principles would ordinarily subject to any constitutional or legal inhibitions or other over riding considerations qualify for being regarded as reasonable while an action which is inconsistent with or runs counter to a Directive Principle would incur the reproach of being unreasonable It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the <ORG> cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the <ORG> such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest The <ORG> therefore cannot for example give a contract or sell or lease out its property for a consideration less than the highest that can be obtained for it unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so We have referred to these considerations to only illustratively for there may be an infinite variety of considerations which may have to be taken into account by the <ORG> in formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of various considerations which have weighed with the <ORG> in taking a particular action that the <ORG> would have to decide whether the action of the <ORG> is reasonable and in public interest But one basic principle which must guide the <ORG> in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the <ORG>al action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the <ORG> by proper and adequate material The <ORG> cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the <ORG> is unreasonable or without public interest because as we said above there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the <ORG> in taking action and therefore the <ORG> would not strike Down governmental action as invalid on this ground unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest It is imperative in a democracy governed by the rule of law that governmental action must be kept within the limits of the law if there is any transgression the <ORG> must be ready to condemn it It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in countries that the legislative check is getting diluted it is left to the <ORG> as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and in this task the court must not flinch or falter It may be pointed out that this ground of invalidity namely that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking in the quality of public interest is different from that of mala fides though it may in a given case furnish evidence of mala fides but if it does so it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure It is in the light of these two limitations on the discretion of the <ORG> in the matter of grant of largess that we must proceed to examine the grounds of attack urged on behalf of the petitioners Re Ground A The argument under this head of challenge was that the <ORG> had under the impugned order granted tapping contract to the nd respondents on terms which were highly disadvantageous to the <ORG> and involved considerable loss of revenue to the Government exchequer The practice which was being followed by the <ORG> until the year was to give out blazes in the chir forests either on wage contract basis or on royalty basis with or without load It appears that from about onwards the <ORG> embarked upon a policy of industrialisation and in furtherance of this policy it decided some time in the later half of that from the year no resin should be allowed to he exported outside the <ORG> territories and that it should be made available for being utilised only in industries set up within the <ORG> But as pointed out above there were certain forests in Reasi Ramban and Poonch Divisions which were difficult of access on account of their distance from the roads and some of the forests in Poonch Division were near the line of actual control and consequently it was found impracticable to give them for tapping on wage contract basis The <ORG> undoubtedly made representations requesting the <ORG> to include these blazes in the auctions but as is evident from the letters dated th February and th March addressed respectively to the Forest Minister The advantage to the <ORG> was that a new factory for manufacture of resin turpentine oil and other derivatives would come up within its territories offering more job opportunities to the people of the <ORG> increasing their prosperity and augmenting the <ORG> revenues and in addition the <ORG> would be assured of a definite supply of at least metric tones of resin for itself without any financial involvement or risk and with this additional quantity of resin available to it it would be able to set up another factory creating more employment opportunities and in fact as the counter affidavit of <NAME> under secretary to the Government filed on behalf of the <ORG> shows the Government lost no time in taking steps to set up a public sector resin distillation plant in a far flung area of the <ORG> namely Sundarbani in Rajouri District We cannot accept the contention of the petitioners that under the im <NAME> pugned order a huge benefit was conferred on the second respondents at the cost of the <ORG> per quintal but even if we take the cost at the minimum figure of Rs It is stated in the counter affidavits of <NAME> and <NAME> and this statement is not seriously challenged on behalf of the petitioners that the cost of extraction and collection as sanctioned by <ORG> for the adjoining accessible forests given on wage contract basis in the year was Rs On this reckoning the cost of metric tones to be retained by the second respondents would work out at Rs This argument plausible though it may seem is fallacious because it does not take into account the policy of the <ORG> not to allow export of resin outside its territories but to allot it only for use in factories set up within the <ORG> Moreover the prices realised at the auctions held in December January and April did not reflect the correct and genuine price of resin because by the time these auctions came to be held it had become known that the <ORG> had taken a policy decision to ban export of resin from its territories with effect from and the prices realised at the auctions were therefore scarcity prices GROUND It is difficult to appreciate how the impugned order could be assaulted on the ground that it created monopoly in favour of the nd respondents or imposed unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners to carry on tapping business under Article The <ORG> also could not award a contract simpliciter for tapping on the basis of royalty with or without load because as a matter of policy with a view to encouraging industrialisation the <ORG> did not want resin to go outside its territories but wanted it to be used only for the purpose of feeding industries set up within the <ORG> and even if a condition could legitimately be imposed on the contractor that he should sell the resin extracted and retained by him only to industries within the <ORG> it would be difficult to ensure observance of such condition and moreover the object of the <ORG> to make resin available to the local industries at a reasonable price might be frustrated because the contractor taking advantage of scarcity in supply of resin might and in all probability would try to extract a much higher price from the industries needing resin The <ORG> may choose to do so if it thinks fit and in a given situation it may even turn to be advantageous for the <ORG> to do so but if any private party comes before the <ORG> and offers to set up an industry the <ORG> would not be committing breach of any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates with such party and agrees to provide resources and other facilities for the purpose of setting up the industry There is in fact no evidence before us to show or even as much as to suggest that any favour was conferred on the nd respondents at the cost of the <ORG> or that the nd respondents were preferred to some others without any basis or justification We must accordingly reject the third ground of challenge urged on behalf of the petitions <NAME> We are therefore of the view that there is no substance in any of the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners and it was for this reason that by an order dated we dismissed both these writ petitions with no order as to costs
