HEADNOTE Section A of the Prevention of Corruption Act pro vided No police officer below the rank of a deputy Superintendent shall investigate any offence punishable under or A of the Indian Penal Code or under of the Act without the order of a magistrate of the first class I A The respondent filed objections questioning inter alia the validity of the Magistrate giving permission to the Sub Inspector to make the investigation The State preferred an appeal against the order of <ORG> by special leave Held that the statutory safeguards under A of the Prevention of Corruption Act must strictly be complied with for they were conceived in public interest and were provided as a guarantee against frivolous and vexatious prosecutions A Magistrate cannot surrender his discretion to a police officer but must exercise it having regard to the relevant material made available to him at the stage of granting permission He must also be satisfied that there is sufficient reason owing to the exigencies of the administrative convenience to entrust a subordinate officer with the investigation Where an officer other than the designated officer seeks to make an investigation he should get order of a Magistrate empowering him to do so before he proceeds to investigate and it is desirable that the order giving the permission should ordinarily on the face of it disclose the reasons for giving permission Where objection is taken by the accused that the order giving permission was invalid the prosecution at the earliest opportunity must adduce evidence to support the contention that the Magistrate gave the permission only after having satisfied himself on the advisability of doing so on the material placed before him Held further that an investigation starts after the police officer receives information in regard to an offence and that as under Of the Act attempt to obtain from any person any gratification is in itself an offence any steps taken by the Sub Inspector after the information was given to him amounted to investigation Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November of <ORG> in Criminal Revision No of arising out of the judgment and order dated August of <ORG> at Gwalior in File No Special Case On January between and he contacted the Sub Inspector of <ORG> Special <ORG> Establishment Gwalior and gave him the following information The company had opened their stall in the Gwalior Mela and he <NAME> had to book empty wooden cases of machine and machine parts from Gwalior Mela to Now Delhi On the same day he sent a report of the aforesaid facts to the Special <ORG> Establishment Office Madhya Bharat Seven days thereafter on January the Sub Inspector filed an application before the Additional District Magistrate Judicial Gwalior asking for permission to investigate the offence under the aforesaid sections The record does not disclose what further steps were taken by the Sub Inspector after he obtained the said permission from the Additional District Magistrate It appears from the record that soon after the case was taken up for trial the respondent filed objections questioning inter alia the validity of the order of the Additional District Magistrate giving permission to the Sub Inspector to make the investigation It appears that the Special Judge intended to take evidence on the question of delegation of power of investigation but the prosecution applied for adjournment on the ground that an appeal had been filed in <ORG> against a similar order directing the prosecution to give evidence on the said question and the same was pending there By the said order the learned Judge presumably an officer different from the one who gave the adjournment in disallowed the objection of the accused on the ground that on the date when the Magistrate gave the sanction there were many papers in connection with a case against the accused on observing which the Magi strate could have satisfied himself whether there was a prima facie case or not against the accused and that there was no reason to believe that at the time of giving the sanction the Magistrate did not peruse the papers <ORG> came to the conclusion that the Sub Inspector applied for permission ten days after investigation had started and that the Magistrate did not satisfy himself that there were good and sufficient reasons for authorising the officer of a lower rank to conduct the investigation but had given the permission as a mere matter of routine Where in any trial of an offence punishable under section or section of the Indian Penal Code Act of it is proved that an accused person has accepted or obtained or has agreed to accept or attempted to obtain for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration or any valuable thing from any person it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain that gratification or that valuable thing as the case may be as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in the said section or as the case may be without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate To achieve this object ss A and introduced the following two safeguards no police officer below the rank a in the presidency towns of Madras and Calcutta of an assistant commissioner of police in the presidency town of Bombay of a superintendent of police and elsewhere of a deputy superintendent of police shall investigate any offence punishable under or A of the Indian Penal Code or under sub of of the Act without the order of a presidency magistrate or a magistrate of the first class as the case may be or make any arrest therefor without a warrant see A no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under or or of the Indian Penal Code or under of the Act alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> see These statutory safeguards must be strictly complied with for they were conceived in public interests and were provided as a against frivolous and vexatious prosecutions While in the case of an officer of assured status and rank the legislature was prepared to believe them implicitly it prescribed an additional guarantee in the case of police officers below that rank namely the previous order of a presidency magistrate or a magistrate of the first class as the case may be The magistrate status gives assurance to the bonafide of the investigation In such circumstances it is self evident that a magistrate cannot surrender his discretion to a police officer but must exercise it having regard to the relevant material made available to him at that stage He must also be satisfied that there is sufficient reason owing to the exigencies of administrative convenience to entrust a subordinate officer with the investigation <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> observed at When therefore the <ORG> thought fit to remove the protection from the public servants in so far as it relates to the investigation of the offences of corruption comprised in the Act by making them cognisable it may be presumed that it was considered necessary to provide a substituted safeguard from undue harassment by requiring that the investigation is to be conducted normally by a police officer of a designated high rank After adverting to the argument advanced on behalf of the <ORG> learned Judge closed the discussion thus at We are therefore clear in our opinion that section and provisoto section of the Act and the corresponding section A of Act LIX of are mandatory and not directory and that the investigation conducted inviolation thereof bears the stamp of illegality The desirability of such a course is obvious because when the facts are not set out in the sanction proof has to be given aliunde that sanction was given in respect of the facts constituting the offence charged but an While the former decision emphasises the importance of the protection given by the Act to public servants against harassment the latter decision points out the desirability of giving all the necessary facts in an order giving sanction the same applies to an order of a Magistrate and also the necessity of proof aliunde of the said facts in case the facts are not disclosed in the sanction Applying the said two principles we must hold that in a case where an officer other than the designated officer seeks to make an investigation he should get the order of a Magistrate empowering him to do so before he proceeds to investigate and it is desirable that the order giving the permission should ordinarily on the face of it disclose the reasons for giving the permission For one reason or other if the said salutary practice is not adopted in a particular case it is the duty of the prosecution to establish if that fact is denied that the Magistrate in fact has taken into consideration the relevant circumstances before granting the permission to a subordinate police officer to investigate the case In the present case though objection was taken by the accused at the earliest stage in on the ground that the order giving permission was invalid no attempt was made by the prosecution though years have elapsed between the date of the petition and that of the order of the Sessions Judge to adduce any evidence to support the contention that the Magistrate gave the permission to the Sub Inspector only after satisfying himself on the advisability of doing so on the material placed before him The only material that was placed before the Sessions Judge was the application filed by the Sub Inspector before the Magistrate seeking the said permission and the order made by him thereon Ex facie it appears to us just like it appeared to <ORG> that the Magistrate did not realise the significance of his order giving permission but only mechanically issued the order on the basis of the application which did not disclose any reason presumably because he thought that what was required was only a formal compliance with the provisions of the section A request was made before <ORG> that an opportunity should be given to the prosecution to enable them to produce the necessary evidence to support the order of the Magistrate In this view no other question arises for consideration But as the learned Counsel appearing for the <ORG> contended that the observations of the learned Judge of <ORG> that permission of the Magistrate was obtained ten days after the investigation was started was wrong it would be as well that we considered the argument briefly Chapter XIV of the Code prescribes the procedure for investigation Under the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps i proceeding to the spot ii ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case iii discovery and arrest of the suspected offender iv collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of a the examination of various persons including the accused and the reduction of their statements into writing if the officer thinks fit the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial and formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge sheet under From the narration of facts given supra it would be seen that in the present case <NAME> gave information to the Sub Inspector on January as regards the attempt by the Station Master as well as the Assistant Station Master to take bribe from him Thereafter the Sub Inspector after assisting <NAME> to trap the accused came on the scene questioned the accused searched his person and recovered the marked notes and other articles from him he searched the person of the informant and recovered the other notes marked but not given to the accused he took possession of the twenty wooden boxes intended to be booked and the forwarding note together with the record copy of the he got prepared relevant memoranda for the aforesaid recoveries and got them duly attested by witnesses and thereafter on the basis of his investigation he sent a report to <ORG> Indore We do not know on the material placed before us what further things he did in the matter of investigation between the th and st when be obtained the permission of the District Magistrate
