The four persons named filed three applications under Art of the Constitution before the Bombay High <ORG> questioning the validity of the Act and of the notification and praying for writs for quashing the same <ORG> dismissed the applications and ordered that the said notification was legal and valid except as to the last part of cl thereof which empowered the <ORG> to recommend the action which should be taken as and by way of securing redress or punishment or to act as a preventive in future cases The petitioners as well as the Union of India filed appeals Held that the Act wag valid and intra vires and that the notification was also valid excepting the words as and by way of securing redress or punishment in cl thereof which went beyond the Act The inquiry which may be set up by a law made under these entries is not limited in its scope and ambit to future legislative purposes only Such a law may also be for administrative purposes and the scope of the inquiry under such a law will cover all matters which may properly be regarded as ancillary to such inquiries The discretion given to the <ORG> to set up a <ORG> of Inquiry is guided by the policy laid down in the Act that the executive action is to be taken only when there exists a definite matter of public importance into which an inquiry is necessary It is the best judge of the reliability of the source of the information and if it acts in good faith and honestly comes to the conclusion that the act and conduct of the petitioners and the affairs of their companies constitute a definite matter of public importance the <ORG> will be slow to adjudge the action to be bad and illegal The recommendations of the <ORG> of Inquiry are of great importance to the <ORG> in order to enable it to make up its mind as to what legislative or administrative measures should be adopted to eradicate the evil found or to implement the beneficial objects it has in view The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> six several appeals are directed against a common judgment and order pronounced on April by a Division Bench of <ORG> in three several Miscellaneous Applications under Art <ORG> has filed three several appeals namely Nos and of in the said three Miscellaneous Applications complaining against that part of the said judgment and order of <ORG> which adjudged the last part of el The <ORG>s of Inquiry Act hereinafter referred to as the Act received the assent of the President on August and was thereafter brought into force by a notification issued by <ORG> under of the Act Under sub of that section the <ORG> may consist of one or more members and where the <ORG> consists of more than one member one of them may be appointed as the Chairman thereof Section vests in the <ORG> the powers of a civil court while trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure in respect of the several matters specified therein namely summoning and enforcing attendance of any person and examining him on oath requiring discovery and production of any document receiving evidence on affidavits requisitioning any public record or copy thereof from any court or officer issuing commissions for examination of witnesses or documents and any other matter which may be prescribed Section provides that no statement made by a person in the course of giving evidence before the commission shall subject him to or be used against him in any civil or criminal proceeding except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such statement provided that the statement is made in reply to a question which he is required by the <ORG> to answer or is relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry The appropriate <ORG> may under issue a notification declaring that the <ORG> shall cease to exist from such date as may be specified therein By the <ORG> is empowered subject to any rules that may be made to regulate its own procedure including the time and place of its sittings and may act notwithstanding the temporary absence of any member or the existence of any vacancy among its members In exercise of the powers conferred on it by of the Act the Central <ORG> published in <ORG> dated December a notification in the following terms <ORG> Department of Economic Affairs ORDER New Delhi the th December Whereas it has been made to appear to the Central Government that a large number of companies and some firms were promoted and or controlled by <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> or some one or more of them and by others being either relatives or employees of the said person or persons closely connected with the said persons large amounts were subscribed by the investing public in the shares of some of these companies there have been gross irregularities which may in several respects and materials amount to illegalities in the management of such companies including manipulation of the accounts and unjustified transfers and use of funds and assets the moneys subscribed by the investing public were in a considerable measure used not in the interests of the companies concerned but contrary to their interest and for the ultimate personal benefit of those in control and or management and the investing public have as a result suffered considerable losses And Whereas <ORG> is of the opinion that there should be a full inquiry into these matters which are of definite public importance both by reason of the grave consequences which appear to have ensued to the investing public and also to determine such measures as may be deemed necessary in order to prevent a recurrence thereof Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Commissions of Inquiry Act No The <ORG> shall inquire into and report on and in respect of The administration of the affairs of the companies specified in the schedule hereto The administration of the affairs of such other companies and firms as the <ORG> may during the course of its enquiry find to be companies or firms connected with the companies referred to in the schedule and whose affairs ought to be investigated and inquired into in connection with or arising out of the inquiry into the affairs of the companies specified in the schedule hereto The nature and extent of the control direct and indirect exercised over such companies and firms or any of them by the aforesaid <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> their relatives employees and persons connected with them The total amount of the subscription obtained from the investing public and the amount subscribed by the aforesaid persons and the extent to which the funds and assets thus obtained or acquired were misused misapplied or misappropriated The extent and nature of the investments by and or loans to and or the use of the funds or assets by and transfer of funds between the companies aforesaid The consequences or results of such investments loans transfers and or use of funds and assets The reasons or motives of such investments loans transfers and use and whether there was any justification for the same and whether the same were made bona fide in the interests of the companies concerned The extent of the losses suffered by the investing public how far the losses were avoidable and what steps were taken by those in control and or management to avoid the losses The nature and extent of the personal gains made by any person or persons or any group or groups of persons whether herein named or not by reason of or through his or their connection with or control over any such company or companies Any irregularities frauds or breaches of trust or action in disregard of honest commercial practices or contravention of any law except contraventions in respect of which criminal proceedings are pending in a Court of Law in respect of the companies and firms whose affairs are investigated by the <ORG> which ma come to the knowledge of the <ORG> and the action which in the opinion of the <ORG> should be taken as and by way of securing redress or punishment or to act as a preventive in future cases of the Constitution questioning the validity of the Act and the notification dated December on diverse grounds and praying for a writ or order for quashing the same It is pointed out that the Act by empowers the appropriate <ORG> in certain eventualities to appoint <ORG> for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance and for no other purpose The conduct of villagers in cutting the bunds for taking water to their fields during the dry season may cause floods during the rainy season and we can see no reason why such unsocial conduct of villagers of certain villages thus causing floods should not be regarded as a definite matter of public importance Widespread dacoities in parti cular parts of the country is no doubt a definite matter of public importance but we see no reason why the conduct activities and modes operandi of particular dacoits and thugs notorious for their cruel depredations Confining himself to the entries in so far as they relate to inquiries learned counsel for the petitioners urges that <ORG> may make a law with respect to inquiries but cannot under these entries make a law conferring any power to perform any function other than the power to hold an inquiry He concedes that according to the well recognised rule of construction of the provisions of a Constitution the legislative heads should be construed very liberally and that it must be assumed that the Constitution intended to give to the appropriate legislature not only the power to legislate with respect to the particular legislative topic but also with respect to all matters ancillary thereto He however points out that the law which the appropriate legislature is empowered to make under these entries must be with respect to inquiries for the purposes of any of the matters in the relevant lists and it is urged that the words for the purpose of make it abundantly clear that the law with respect to inquiries to be made under these two entries must be for the purpose of future legislation with respect to any of the legislative heads in the relevant lists In other words the argument is that under these two entries the appropriate legislature may make a law authorising the constitution of a <ORG> or <ORG> to inquire into and ascertain facts so as to enable such legislature to undertake legislation with respect to any of the legislative topics in the relevant lists to secure some public benefit or advantage or to prevent some evil or harm befalling the public and thereby to protect the public from the same And far less can a law be made with respect to an inquiry into any wrongs alleged to have been committed by an individual person or company or a group of them for the purpose of punishing the suspected delinquent This argument has found favour with <ORG> but we are with great respect unable to accept this view read with this entry <ORG> as well as the <ORG> may make a law with respect to inquiries for the purpose of any of the matters in List II has no power to make a law with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List Clearly <ORG> can make a law for inquiry for the purpose of any of the matters in List and none the less so though <ORG> cannot legislate with respect to such matters and though none of the State Legislatures wants to Legislate on such matters In our opinion therefore the law to be made by the appropriate legislature with respect to the two legislative entries referred to above may cover inquiries into any aspect of the matters enumerated in any of the lists mentioned therein and is not confined to those matters as mere heads of legislative topic Quite conceivably the law with respect to inquiries for the purpose of any of the matters in the lists may also be for administrative purposes and the scope of the inquiry under such a law will cover all matters which may properly be regarded as ancillary to such inquiries We are unable therefore to hold that the Inquiry which may be set up by a law made under these two entries is in its scope or ambit limited to future legislative purposes only Learned counsel then takes us through the different heads of inquiry enumerated in the notification and urges that the inquiry is neither for any legislative nor for any administrative purpose but is a clear usurpation of the functions of the judiciary It cannot it is urged undertake to inquire or investigate into alleged individual wrongs or private disputes nor can it bring the supposed culprit to book or gather materials for the purpose of initiating proceedings civil or criminal against him because such inquiry or investigation is clearly not in aid of legislation It is argued that if a criminal prosecution is to be launched the preliminary investigation must be held under the Code of Criminal Procedure and it should not be open to any legislature to start investigation on its own and thereby to deprive the citizen of the normal protection afforded to him by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure While we find ourselves in partial agreement with the actual conclusion of <ORG> on this point we are with great respect unable to accept the line of reasoning advanced by learned counsel for the petitioners which has been accepted by <ORG> for more reasons than one The <ORG> has no power of adjudication in the sense of passing an order which can be enforced proprio vigore A clear distinction must on the authorities be drawn between a decision which by itself has no force and no penal effect and a decision which becomes enforceable immediately or which may become enforceable by some action being taken In the view we have taken it is also not necessary for us to consider whether had the Act conferred on the appropriate <ORG> power to set up <ORG> with judicial powers such law could not subject of course to the other provisions of the Con stitution be supported as a law made under some entry in List I or List III authorising the setting up of courts read with these two entries for a legislation may well be founded on several entries Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners who are appellants in Civil Appeals Nos and of goes as far as to say that while the <ORG> may find facts on which the <ORG> may take action legislative or executive although he does not concede the latter kind of action to be contemplated the <ORG> cannot be asked to suggest any measure legislative or executive to be taken by the appropriate <ORG> An inquiry necessarily involves investigation into facts and necessitates the collection of material facts from the evidence adduced before or brought to the notice of the person or body conducting the inquiry and the recording of its findings on those facts in its report cannot but be regarded as ancillary to the inquiry itself for the inquiry becomes useless unless the findings of the inquiring body are made available to the <ORG> which set up the inquiry It is in our judgment equally ancillary that the person or body conducting the inquiry should express its own view on the facts found by it for the consideration of the appropriate <ORG> in order to enable it to take such measure as it may think fit to do The whole purpose of setting up of a <ORG> of Inquiry consisting of experts will be frustrated and the elaborate process of inquiry will be deprived of its utility if the opinion and the advice of the expert body as to the measures the situation disclosed calls for cannot be placed before the <ORG> for consideration notwithstanding that doing so cannot be to the prejudice of anybody because it has no force of its own In our view the recommendations of a <ORG> of Inquiry are of great importance to the <ORG> in order to enable it to make up its mind as to what legislative or administrative measures should be adopted to eradicate the evil found or to implement the beneficial objects it has in view But seeing that the <ORG> of Inquiry has no judicial powers and its report will purely be recommendatory and not effective proprio vigore and the statement made by any person before the <ORG> of Inquiry is under of the Act wholly inadmissible in evidence in any future proceedings civil or criminal there can be no point in the <ORG> of Inquiry making recommendations for taking any action as and by way of securing redress or punishment which in agreement with <ORG> we think refers in the context to wrongs already done or committed for redress or punishment for such wrongs if any has to be imposed by a court of law properly constituted exercising its own discretion on the facts and circumstances of the case and without being in any way influenced by the view of any person or body howsoever august or high powered it may be Having regard to all these considerations it appears to us that only that portion of the last part of cl which calls upon the <ORG> of Inquiry to make recommendations about the action to be taken as and by way of securing redress or punishment cannot be said to be at all necessary for or ancillary to the purposes of the <ORG> We find ourselves in substantial agreement with the reasons given by <ORG> on this point and we hold that the efficacy of the notification is in no way affected by the deletion of the offending words mentioned above and there is no reason to think that the <ORG> would not have issued the notification without those words In order however to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled filled namely i that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and ii that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question The decisions of this Court further establish a that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if on account of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not applicable to others that single individual may be treated as a class by himself that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles that it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds that the legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation and that while good faith and knowledge of the existing conditions on the part of a legislature are to be presumed if there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances brought to the notice of the court on which the classification may reasonably be regarded as based the presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reasons for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile or discriminating legislation The above principles will have to be constantly borne in mind by the court when it is called upon to adjudge the constitutionality of any particular law attacked as discriminatory and violative of the equal protection of the laws A close perusal of the decisions of this <ORG> in which the above principles have been enunciated and applied by this <ORG> will also show that a statute which may come up for consideration on a question of its validity under Art In determining the validity or otherwise of such a statute the court has to examine whether such classification is or can be reasonably regarded as based upon some differentia which distinguishes such persons or things grouped together from those left out of the group and whether such differentia has a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute no matter whether the provisions of the statute are intended to apply only to a particular person or thing or only to a certain class of persons or things In determining the question of the validity or otherwise of such a statute the court will not strike down the law out of hand only because no Classification appears on its face or because a discretion is given to the <ORG> to make the selection or classification but will go on to examine and ascertain if the statute has laid down any principle or policy for the guidance of the exercise of discretion by the <ORG> in the matter of the selection or classification Section empowers the appropriate <ORG> in certain circumstances therein mentioned to appoint <ORG> for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance and performing such functions within such time as may be specified in the notification It seems clear and it has not been controverted that on a proper construction of this a classification so that this statute falls within the first category mentioned above and contends that this classification of things is based on an intelligible differentia which has a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by it for a definite matter of public importance may well call for an inquiry by a Commission This delegation of authority however is not unguided or uncontrolled for the discretion given to the appropriate <ORG> to set up <ORG> must be guided by the policy laid down namely that the executive action of setting up <ORG> must conform to the condition of the section that is to say that there must exist a definite matter and if the preamble to the statute considered in the case of <NAME> could be construed as laying down sufficiently clearly a policy or principle for the guidance of the executive what objection can there be to construing of the Act now under our consideration as also making a reasonable classification or at any rate as declaring with sufficient clarity the policy of <ORG> and laying down a principle for the guidance of the exercise of the powers conferred the appropriate <ORG> so as to bring this statute at least in the fourth category if not also in the first category On the authorities as they stand it cannot be said that an arbitrary and uncontrolled power has been delegated to the appropriate <ORG> and that therefore the law itself is bad Article protects all persons from discrimination by the legislative as well as by the executive organ of the <ORG> He made a report which was however incomplete in certain particulars We find no force in this argument The point which is next urged in support of these appeals and which has given us considerable anxiety is that the petitioners and their companies have been arbitrarily singled out for the purpose of hostile and discriminatory treatment and subjected to a harassing and oppressive inquiry it is contended protect every person against discrimination by the <ORG> namely against the law as well as the executive action and this protection extends to <ORG> action at all its stages Reference is made to the Memorandum filed by <ORG> before <ORG> showing that the same or similar allegations had been made not only against the petitioners and their companies but against other businessmen and their companies and that although the petitioners and their companies and those other persons and their companies were thus similarly situate in that allegations had been made against both the <ORG> arbitrarily applied the Act to the petitioners and their companies and issued the notification concerning them but left out the others from its operation The appropriate <ORG> cannot in such matters be expected to sit down and hold a judicial inquiry into the truth of the materials brought before it and examine the informants on oath in the presence of the parties who are or may be likely to be affected by its decision It is the best judge of the reliability of its source of information and if it acts in good faith on the materials brought to its notice and honestly comes to the conclusion that the act and conduct of the petitioners and the affairs of their companies constitute a definite matter of public importance calling for an inquiry with a view to devise measures for preventing the recurrence of such evil this <ORG> not being in possession of all the facts will we apprehend be slow to adjudge the executive action to be bad and illegal It may also have had other information available to it and on those materials it formed its opinion that the act and conduct of the petitioners and the affairs of their companies constituted a definite matter of public importance which required a full inquiry Up to this stage there is no question of legal proof of the allegations against the petitioners as in a court of law Reference is again made to the several matters enumerated in the five clauses set out in the first preamble to the notification and it is urged that those matters do not at all disclose any intelligible differentia on the basis of which the petitioners and their companies can be grouped together as a class On the part of <ORG> reference is made to the affidavits affirmed by <NAME> the Principal Secretary to <ORG> purporting to set out in detail as the background thereof the circumstances which led to the issue of the impugned notification and the matters recited therein and the several reports referred to in the said affidavit Learned counsel for the petitioners take the objection that reference cannot be made to any extraneous matter and that the basis of classification must appear on the face of the notification itself and reliance is placed on certain observations in the dissenting judgments in <NAME> case and in item of the summary given by <NAME> in his judgment in <NAME> case In our judgment therefore there can be no objection to the matters brought to the notice of the court by the affidavit of <NAME> being taken into consideration along with the matters specified in the notification in order to ascertain whether there was any valid basis for treating the petitioners and their companies as a class by themselves Learned counsel for the petitioners next urges that even if the matters referred to in <NAME> affidavits and those appearing on the face of the notification are taken into consideration one cannot deduce therefrom any differentia which may be taken to distinguish the petitioners and their companies from other persons and their companies There is no force in this argument The question before us is not whether the allegations made on the face of the notification and in the affidavits filed on behalf of <ORG> are true but whether the qualities and characteristics if honestly believed to be found in the petitioners are so peculiar or unique as to constitute a good and valid basis on which the petitioners and their companies can be regarded as a class by themselves It is sufficient for our present purpose to say that the facts disclosed on the face of the notification itself and the facts which have been brought to our notice by the affidavits afford sufficient support to the presumption of constitutionality of the notification Indeed nowhere in the petitions is there even an averment that there are other persons or companies similarly situate as the petitioners and their companies Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner who is the appellant in Civil Appeal No of makes it clear that no personal motive or illwill against the petitioners is imputed to any one but he points out that <ORG> had been set up and the Companies Act has been remodelled and therefore the present <ORG> was not set up for any legitimate purpose This point has been further emphasised by learned counsel appearing for the petitioners who are appellants in Civil Appeals Nos and of He has drawn our attention to the affidavits filed by his clients and contends that it was well known to the <ORG> that none of them was concerned in promoting or managing any of the companies and their position being thus well known to the <ORG> their inclusion in the notification was both outside the power conferred by the <ORG> and also constituted a mala fide exercise of the power conferred on it No substantial ground in support of this point has been brought before us and we are not satisfied that the circumstances referred to in the notification and the affidavits filed on behalf of <ORG> may not if true be the basis of a further inquiry into the matter It will be for the <ORG> to inquire into the allegations and come to its own findings and make its report containing its recommendations We do not think there is any substance in this too There was nothing to prevent the Government from issuing a fresh notification appointing a <ORG> and fixing a time If that could be done there was no reason why the same result could not be achieved by the combined effect of two notifications In any case the amending notification taken together with the original notification may be read as a fresh notification within the meaning of of the Act operative at least from the date of the later notification Assuming that there is delegation of legislative function the Act having laid down its policy such delegation of power if any is not vitiated at all for the legislation by the delegates will have to conform to the policy so laid down by the Act It is frankly stated by the learned counsel We make no order as to the costs of these three appeals
