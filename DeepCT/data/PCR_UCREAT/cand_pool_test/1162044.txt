This order shall also govern the disposal of Misc Appeal No of Dr <NAME> <ORG> In both the cases a preliminary point has been raised to the effect that the appointment of the Additional District Judge as <ORG> by official designation is invalid and therefore the <ORG> below had no jurisdiction to try the case Our learned brother <NAME> felt that that Notification was in violation of Section of the Act in so far as it permits a person to be a member of the <ORG> who may not fulfil the qualifications enunciated in Sub section of Section of the Motor Vehicles Act Therefore <NAME> thought that there might be a conceivable case where a person may be an Additional District Judge who has not fulfilled the qualifications prescribed for appointment as a Judge of a High Court under Article of the Constitution of India Section of the General Clauses Act empowers the appointing authority to appoint a functionary either by name or by virtue of office Therefore in the year there was a suggestion that appointments of <ORG> might be made by office But if an appointment is made by official designation there may be a remote probability of a person holding the office of the Additional District Judge <NAME> who is not qualified to be appointed a Judge of <ORG> as per Article of the Constitution of India We feel that our learned brother <NAME> has taken an extreme view in holding that an appointment by official designation would be rendered invalid in all types of cases even though the Additional District Judge concerned may be a person qualified to be appointed a Judge of <ORG> Section of the General Clauses Act permits appointment either by name or by office and if the view propounded by our learned brother were to be accepted it would imply that there can be no appointment by official designation where certain qualifications are prescribed for such appointments But there is no bar to the appointment of a persona designata by official designation as per Section of the General Clauses Act But the question in each case to be decided on facts and circumstances would be whether the appointment by official designation has actually resulted in the appointment of an unqualified person for a particular office or <ORG> Therefore we feel that it is necessary to modify the observations made by our learned brother <NAME> to this extent by stating that the appointment by official designation would be invalid only if it results in appointment of a person not qualified to hold the post An Additional District Judge shall discharge any of the functions of a District Judge including the functions of <ORG> of original jurisdiction which the District Judge may by general or special order assign to him and in discharge of such functions he shall exercise the same powers as the District Judge In this connection we might refer to the observations of <ORG> of this Court in <NAME> <NAME> Misc For that purpose he quashed the Notification holding that <ORG> appointed under the Notification had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim In a Civil Revision the Notification could only be declared invalid and could not be quashed which might properly be done in exercise of prerogative rights under Article of the Constitution of India In actual fact it would make no difference whether the Notification is quashed or declared invalid However we are unable to agree with the view expressed by our learned brother <NAME> and expressing our dissent with due respect to the learned Judge we hold that the Notification is valid and that it does not contravene the provisions of Section of the Motor Vehicles Act Morever on a reference to the Civil List published by <ORG> we find that the Member of the Tribunal <NAME> Additional District Judge has put in much more than years service as a judicial officer and as such he was qualified to be appointed a Judge of <ORG> under Article of the Constitution of India As a result we overrule the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the appellant and proceed to decide the case on merits The accident took place on when truck No A owned by the second respondent <NAME> and driven by the third respondent <NAME> which was proceeding from Satna to Amarpatan dashed against the cycle of the deceased <NAME> who was returning from <ORG> at Amarpatan to village Gadauli The deceased had left the first respondent his widow and a daughter aged about years who would be without a bread earner of the family The defence of the second and the third respondents was that there was no rash and negligent driving on the part of the truck driver but the deceased himself who used to drink sometimes was under the influence of liquor and the accident took place because of that fact It was also admitted by the said respondents that the third respondent driver had been fined for the rash and negligent driving in connection with this accident by <ORG> It was found as a fact that the deceased was towards the extreme left side of the road The said application was filed on i much beyond the period of limitation Similarly the question whether relief could be given to the second respondent the truck owner by exercising power under Order Rule was kept open by the said order Therefore we propose to consider this question Section of the Motor Vehicles Act permits the insurer to challenge the award of compensation on grounds mentioned in the sub section and Sub section of the said section lays down that no insurer to whom the notice referred to in Sub section or Subsection A has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in Sub section or Sub section A otherwise than in the manner provided for in Sub section or in the corresponding law of the State of Jammu and Kashmir or of the reciprocating country as the case may be It is relevant to reproduce Sub section which is as follows No sum shall be payable by an Insurer umder Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the Court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of Section or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward or for organized racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condtion excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war riot or civil war civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the nondisclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular The ground is absolutely vague and it is not permissible for the insurer to challenge the award on any ground except the one mentioned in Section of the Article The sixth ground challenges the quantum of compensation complaining that the correct tests were not applied by the <ORG> We may observe that the insurer has only certain limited grounds on which it can avoid its liability as permitted by Section of the Act and Sub section of the said section clearly lays down that the liability cannot be avoided in any other manner except to the extent permitted by Sub section The application for transposition was made much beyond the period of days which was beyond limitation Therefore if Order Rule were allowed to be invoked it would give an undue advantage to the insurer despite the fact that the insured has remained satisfied with the award of <ORG> In this view of the matter in a case of the present type invoking Order Rule would amount to an abuse of the processes of <ORG> so as to set at naught the specific provisions as contained in Sections and of the Motor Vehicles Act Therefore we reject the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that power under Order Rule should be invoked so as to give relief to a non appealing respondent Accordingly it is dismissed with costs
