principles of natural justice by affording the persons interested in the land a reasonable opportunity of being heard and of adducing material before the Collector to refute the allegations of the company The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These three appeals Nos to of by special leave which are directed against the common judgment of <ORG> dated April in Special Civil Application Nos of of and of arise thus Proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter referred to as the Act for acquisition of certain lands in villages Sayajipuri Bapow and Savad District Baroda Taluka Baroda were initiated by <ORG> at the instance of <ORG> registered under the Gujarat Co operative Societies Act hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> for the purpose of establishing an industrial estate for small scale industries The acquisition being for the <ORG> a notification was issued under section of the Act on July after following the provisions of Part VII of the Act The owners of the aforesaid lands who are contesting respondents herein challenged the aforesaid notifications issued under section and of the Act by filing petitions under Article of the Constitution of India inter alia on the ground that the provisions of the Rule of the Land Acquisition Companies Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules made by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred under section of the Act which by virtue of Rule of the Rules apply to acquisition of land for all companies under Part VII of the Act have not been complied with particularly as they had not been given a right to be heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice at the enquiry held by Special Land Acquisition Officer Baroda appellant No herein What particular rule of natural justice should be implied and what its content should be for a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the frame work of the law under which the enquiry is held and the constitution and nature of duties of the <ORG> or the body of persons appointed for that purpose Let us therefore advert to the provisions of Rule of the Rules which requires the appropriate <ORG> to be satisfied with regard to certain matters before initiating acquisition proceedings The Collector shall after giving the company a reasonable opportunity to make any representation in this behalf hold an enquiry into the matters referred to in sub rule and while holding such enquiry he shall i in any case where the land proposed to be acquired is agricultural land consult the Senior Agricultural Officer of the district whether or not such land is good agricultural land ii determine having regard to the provisions of sections and of the Act the approximate amount of compensation likely to be payable in respect of the land which in the opinion of the Collector should be acquired for the Company and ii ascertain whether the Company offered a reasonable price not being less than the compensation so determined to the persons interested in the land proposed to be acquired No declaration shall be made by the appropriate Government under section of the Act unless i the appropriate Government has consulted the Committee and has considered the report submitted under this rule and the report if any submitted under section A of the Act and ii the agreement under section of the Act has been executed by the Company To sum up sub rule of the above quoted rule requires the appropriate <ORG> to which an application is made by a Company for acquisition of land to direct the Collector to submit a report on six matters set out therein A conjoint reading of sub rules and leaves no room for doubt that the enquiry by the Collector which is meant inter alia to find out whether all reasonable efforts have been made by the Company to get the land by negotiation on payment of reasonable price and such efforts have not fructified and to determine the approximate amount of compensation likely to be payable in respect of the land keeping in view the provisions of sections and of the Act is of vital importance to the persons interested in the land Although the above mentioned rule is silent regarding the mode and method of the enquiry to be held by the Collector and the report of the Collector is of a recommendatory character yet regard being had to the legislative history and purpose of the rule and the mischief sought to be prevented we have no hesitation in holding that in conducting the enquiry the Collector has in the interest of fair play to observe the principles of natural justice by affording the persons interested in the land a reasonable opportunity of being heard and of adducing material before the Collector to refute the allegations of the Company The concept of natural justice which as evident from the observations made in <NAME> case supra has undergone a great deal of change in recent years Section of the Act provides that the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section at any time after the publication of the notification under section of the Act For the foregoing reasons the question is answered in the affirmative and the appeals are dismissed
