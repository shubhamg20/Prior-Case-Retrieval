PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT STATE OF RAJASTHAN AND OTHER PETITIONS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> BENCH <NAME> <NAME> MUKHERJEE <NAME> CJ DAS SUDHI RANJAN BHAGWATI NATWARLAL IMAM SYED JAFFER CITATION AIR SCR ACT Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act Raja sthan Act VI of Validity <ORG> Competence to enact the law Covenant of the United <ORG> of Rajasthan arts The petitions were dismissed and thereupon they filed petitions before <ORG> under Art They contended inter alia that the <ORG> had no competence to enact the law that the Bill was not prepared by the <ORG> as required by Art A that resumption was not one of the topics of legislation enumerated either in the <ORG> List or in the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and that the Act was therefore ultra vires the powers of the <ORG> that the Act did not provide for adequate compensation nor was there any public purpose involved in it and therefore it contravened Art and that as the Act was discrimi natory it contravened Art There were some special contentions that the Act was not saved by Art Article does not require that that authority should have had absolute and unlimited powers of legislation If it was functioning as the legislative authority before the Constitution it would under the article have all the powers conferred by the Constitution on the <ORG> or <ORG>s of legislature of the <ORG>s There is no provision in Art Resumption and acquisition connote two different concepts but whether the impugned Act is one for acquisition of jagirs or for their resumption must be determined with ref erence to the pith and substance of the legislation the name given to it by the legislature not being decisive of the matter Later on grants made for religious and charitable purposes and even to non Rajputs were called jagirs and both in its popular sense and legislative practice the word jagir came to be used as connoting all grants which conferred on the grantees rights in respect of land revenue and that is the sense in which the word jagir should be construed in Art A it would make no difference whether the grant is made by the sovereign in the exercise of his prerogative right or by the legislature in the exercise of its sovereign rights Grants which are the creatures of statutes called legislative grants are equally within the operation of that article Section of the Mewar <ORG> Kanoon Mal Act of enacts that all lands belong to <NAME> and that no person has authority to take possession of any lands unless the right is granted by <NAME> Article Clause of the Constitution of Mewar provided that no person shall be deprived of his life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall any person be denied equality before the law within the territories of Mewar It was contended for the petitioners that the impugned Act was void as contravening the above provisions ix Objections raised as to the validity of the Act on the ground that it did not provide for payment of compensation that there was no public purpose involved in the resumption and that therefore it contravenes Art as under the Act all jagirs are liable to be resumed no power having been conferred on the <ORG> to grant exemption The true scope of the rule of ejusdem generis is that words of a general nature following specific and particular words should be construed as limited to things which are of the same nature as those specified and not its reverse that specific words which precede are controlled by the general words which follow In accordance with these suggestions a fresh Bill was prepared in <ORG> incorporating certain amendments and it was approved by the <ORG> on and reserved for the consideration of the President who gave his assent to it on Acting under this provision the State of Rajasthan issued notifications resuming the jagirs specified therein whereupon petitions under Article of the Constitution were filed by the persons aggrieved challenging the validity of the Act The present applications have been filed under article impugning the Act on the following grounds I The <ORG> had no competence to enact law and the Act in question is therefore not a valid piece of legislation The Act does not provide for adequate compensation nor is there any public purpose involved in it and so it contravenes article It is discriminatory and therefore contravenes article On the first question as to the competence of the Rajpramukh to enact the law it is necessary to notice the events which led up to the formation of the State of Rajasthan and the constitution of the Rajpramukh as its head There were at that time independent rulers functioning over different parts of Rajasthan As the authority of the <ORG> to enact the impugned legislation was founded on this Covenant it is necessary to refer to the material provisions thereof bearing on the question Article was subsequently modified by substituting for the words Until a Constitution so framed comes into operation after receiving the assent of the Rajpramukh the words Until <ORG> has been duly constituted and summoned to meet for the first session under the provisions of the Constitution of India These are the material provisions of the Constitution which was in force in the United State of Rajasthan before the Constitution of India came into operation on Article of the Constitution enacts Until the <ORG> or <ORG>s of the Legislature of a State specified in Part of the First Schedule has or have been duly constituted and summoned to meet for the first session under the provisions of this Constitution the body or authority functioning immediately before the commencement of this Constitution as the legislature of the corresponding Indian States shall exercise the powers and perform the duties conferred by the provisions of this Constitution on the <ORG> or <ORG>s of the Legislature of the State so specified It is the contention of the respondent that the <ORG> was by reason of article of the Covenant the authority functioning immediately before the commencement of the Constitution as the <ORG> of Rajasthan and that he could under article exercise the powers which the <ORG> of the <ORG> could no House of <ORG> had been constituted and summoned and that to that extent the requirements of that Article are satisfied but their contention is that on a true construction of the articles of the Covenant the <ORG> was not an authority functioning as <ORG> within the meaning of article and further that article VII of the Covenant imposed a prohibition on his power to enact a law of the kind now under challenge and that the prohibition had not been abrogated by the Constitution The meaning of this provision is clear and unambigu ous but it is argued for the petitioners that it is con trolled and cut down by the expression Ordinance in article and by the terms of article VII and of article XIX It is contended by Mr <NAME> that the legislative authority of the <ORG> was only to make and promulgate Ordinance that it is a limited power conferred on him to be exercised in case of emergency pending the constitution of popular legislature and that accordingly he was not a legislative authority for the purpose of article Sections and of the Government of India Act conferred on the Governor General and the Governor respectively power to promulgate ordinances when the <ORG> was not in session Similar power is conferred on the President and the Governors by articles and of the Constitution But the United <ORG> of Rajasthan had then no <ORG> which had yet to be constituted and therefore in its context the word Ordinance in article cannot bear the meaning which it has under the Government of India Act or the Constitution legislative authority such as was formerly exercised by the rulers and where was it lodged if not in the <ORG> If we are to construe article in the manner contended for by the petitioners then the anomalous result will follow that there was in that State no authority in which the legislative power was vested That clearly is the sense in which the word is used in article and that is placed beyond doubt by the words which follow that the Ordinance is to have the like force of law as an Act passed by <ORG> It was next urged that under article VII the <ORG> was given authority to resume jagirs only in accordance with law and custom that he had no authority to enact a law for the resumption of jagirs on grounds other than those recognised by law and custom that section of the Act provided that the resumption was to take effect notwithstanding any jagir law which as defined in section includes also custom that such a law was directly opposed to what was authorised by article VII that the legislative powers conferred under article must be exercised subject to the restrictions under article VII and that the Act was therefore beyond his competence That power is purely an executive one and has nothing to do with the legislative power of the ruler which is specially provided for in article Even if the petitioners are right in their contention that article VII imposes a limitation on the powers of the Rajpramukh that would not in view of article derogate from the power of the Rajpramukh to enact the present law The scope of that article is that the body or authority which was functioning before the commencement of the Consti tution as <ORG> has first to be ascertained and when once that has been done and the body or authority identified the Constitution confides to that body or authority all the powers conferred by the provisions of the Constitution on the <ORG> or <ORG>s of Legislature of the State It was next argued that the powers of the Rajpramukh under article were subject to the general control of <ORG> under article XIX and that he could not therefore be regarded as legislative authority for the purpose of article We see no force in this contention Article provides that the authority which was to exercise legislative powers in the interim period under that Article should be the authority which was functioning as <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution It does not further require that that authority should have possessed absolute and unlimited powers of legislation it was finally contended that article has no application to the present case because under article the <ORG> is to consist of both the Governor and one or more <ORG> that article extends article to Part <ORG>s substituting the <ORG> in the place of the Governor that accordingly the <ORG> cannot by himself constitute the <ORG> and that when article refers to the body or authority functioning as <ORG> it could only refer to both the <ORG> and the <ORG> functioning in conjunction Nor can any argument be founded on the exclusion of the first proviso to article but not of the body of that article under article A because it lays down the procedure to be followed when a Bill has been passed by <ORG> or <ORG> <ORG> and is by its very terms inapplicable when there is no <ORG> of <ORG> The contention of Mr <NAME> that the non inclusion of the body of article among the articles excluded from application to Part <ORG>s under article A imposes by implication a limi tation on the power of the <ORG> to enact laws unless they are passed by Legislative Assemblies is not supported by anything in the article and must be rejected We must accordingly bold that the <ORG> had legislative competence to enact the law under challenge Then there is firstly an endorsement approved signed by the <NAME> and dated and then follows another endorsement I hereby reserve this Bill for the consideration of the President similarly signed and dated Article A was enacted by the Constitution Removal of Difficulties Order No and is as follows The Rajpramukh or other authority exercising the legislative powers in any such State as aforesaid under article shall prepare such Bills as may be deemed necessary and the Rajpramukh shall declare as respects any Bill so prepared either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves it for the consideration of the President These allegations they con tend preclude any supposition that the <ORG> had any part or lot in the settlement of the policies underlying the Act and the Bill must be held therefore not to have been prepared by him It was argued that when the Bill was sent to the <NAME> he was not called upon to apply his legislative mind to it but to merely assent to it on the executive side that when the <NAME> endorsed his approval he was as admitted by Sri <NAME> merely assenting to it that assent implied that the Act assented to was not that of the person assenting and that therefore there was nothing to indicate that the <NAME> had adopted the Bill prepared by the Ministers as his own It was argued by Mr <NAME> that when the word approve was used in the Constitution as in articles and it signified that there were two authorities one of which was authorised to confirm or sanction what the other had authority to do and that when the latter was not authorised to do the act there could be no approval of it by the former and he also relied on the statement of the law in Corpus Juris Volume I page that the word approve does not mean the same thing as adopt It will be noticed that under article A the <NAME> has to do two distinct acts Firstly he has to prepare the Bill and secondly leaving out of consideration the first two alternatives namely assenting to or with holding assent from the Bill as not material for the present discussion he has to reserve it for the consideration of the President In such a case no question of approval to the Bill by him can arise but when the Bill has not been prepared by him he has firstly if he thinks fit to adopt it before he could pass on to the second stage and reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President and the very purpose of his endorsing his approval on the Bill is to show that he has thought fit to adopt it There is no provision in article A for the <NAME> approving of a Bill and in the context therefore an endorsement of approval on the Bill must signify its adoption by him When there is <ORG> in a State the matter is governed by article A and there is substituted under that article in the place of the passing of the Bill by the <ORG> the preparation thereof by the <ORG> and then follows the provision that he has to declare whether he assents to or withholds his assent from the Bill or reserves it for the consideration of the President Under article A the proviso to article has no application to those Part States where there was no <ORG> of the <ORG> and we are unable to follow the argument of the learned counsel that even so the limitation imposed by the proviso is implicit in the body of the article itself While resumption implies that the person or authority which resumes the property has pre existing rights over it acquisition carries no such implication and in general while the effect of resumption is to extinguish the interests of the person whose property is resumed that of acquisition is to vest that interest in the acquirer But the question still remains whether the impugned Act is one for acquisition of jagirs or for their resumption and to determine that we must see what the pith and substance of the legislation is the name given to it by the <ORG> not being decisive of the matter Section authorises the <ORG> to issue notifications for resumption of jagirs and section enacts As from the date of resumption of any jagir lands notwithstanding anything contained in any existing jagir legislation applicable thereto but save as otherwise provided in this Act a the right title and interest of the jagirdar and of every other person claiming through him in his jagir lands including forests etc shall stand resumed to the Government free from all encumbrances Chapter VII prescribes the procedure for the determination of compensation and for payment of the same It is contended that it is these views that have been adopted in section of the Act and that when section a declares that the right title and interest of the jagirdars shall stand resumed it could not mean that these rights are acquired by the <ORG> because acquisition implies that the properties acquired belong to the person from whom they are acquired whereas the basis of the legislation was that the jagirdars bad no property in the lands and there could be no acquisition of what did not belong to them To exercise that right there was no need to enact any legislation The contention of the petitioners that resumption was not an acquisition would strictly be accurate if the resumption was in exercise of the power conferred by that article Section imposes on the Government a liability to pay compensation in accordance with the principles laid down in the second Schedule and as will be presently shown it is not illusory The award of compensation is consistent only with the taking being an acquisition and not with its being a resumption in accordance with the terms of the grant or the law applicable to it for in such cases there is no question of any liability to pay compensation It was argued for the petitioners that the provision for the payment of rehabilitation grant was an indication that what was paid as compensation was in reality ex gratia Under section a what is resumed is expressly the right title and interest of the jagirdar in his jagir lands and provision is made for payment of compensation therefor It was also contended for the respondent that the Act is one relating to land and land tenures and that it would fall under Entry No in the <ORG> List Land that is to say rights in or over land land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant and the collection of rents transfer and alienation of agricultural land land improvement and agricultural loans colonization It was argued that the heads of legislation mentioned in the Entries should receive a liberal construction and the decision in <ORG> was quoted in support of it But there being an Entry No specifically dealing with acquisition and in view of our conclusion as to the nature of the legislation we hold that it falls under that Entry Now we come to the contentions special to some of the petitioners that with reference to the properties held by them the impugned Act is not saved by article A and that it is void as being in contravention of articles and of the Constitution On the first question the contention of the petitioners is that the properties held by them are neither estates nor Jagirs nor other similar grants within article A and that therefore the impugned Act falls quoad hoc outside the ambit of that article It was stated by Mr <NAME> that the grants would in general specify the amount of revenue that was expected to be received from the jagir and that if the jagirdar received more he was under an obligation to account to the <ORG> for the excess It also appears that in the laws enacted in the <ORG>s of Rajputana to which our attention has been drawn the word jagir is generally used in its extended meaning Thus both in its popular sense and legislative practice the word jagir is used as connoting <ORG> grants which conferred on the grantees rights in respect of land revenue We do not find any sufficient ground for putting a restricted meaning on the word jagir in article A We may now proceed to consider the contentions of the several petitioners with reference to the specific properties held by them and they may be grouped under two categories those relating to the tenures on which the properties are held and those relating to particular properties On these facts it is contended by Mr <NAME> and <NAME> that Bhomicharas are not holders of jagirs or other similar grants within the meaning of article A because a jagir could be created only by grant by the ruler and that the petitioners could not be said to hold under a grant from Jodhpur because they had obtained the territory by right of conquest long before Jodhpur established its suzerainty and even prior to its foundation as a State and that though they lost their political independence when Jodhpur established its overlord ship they had not lost their right to property that their status was that of semi independent chiefs not jagirdars and that Foujbal was paid by them not on account of land revenue but by way of tribute We do not base this conclusion on the ground put forward by Mr <NAME> that the word <ORG> in article A should be read ejusdem generis with other similar grants because the true scope of the rule of ejusdem generis is that words of a general nature following specific and particular words should be construed as limited to things which are of the same nature as those specified and not its reverse that specific words which precede are controlled by the general words which follow Applying these principles when Jodhpur as a sovereign <ORG> imposed its sovereignty over the territory and permitted the ex rulers to continue in possession of their lands on payment of an annual sum the position is that there was in effect a conquest of the territory and a re grant of the same to the ex rulers whose title to the lands should thereafter be held to rest on the recognition of it by the ruler of Jodhpur It is argued that notwithstanding that the <NAME> had acknowledged the sovereignty of the ruler of Jodhpur his hold over the country was slight and ineffective and even the payment of <NAME> was irregular and that in substance therefore they enjoyed semi sovereign status and that their relationship to the Jodhpur ruler resembled that of the rulers of Native States to the British <ORG> There was no State with a ruler acknowledged as its head but a number of persons holding lands independently of each other There was again a Customs Act in and it applied to the whole of Marwar including this area It was also contended for the respondent that even if on the facts aforesaid a grant from the <ORG> could not be implied and the status of the petitioners was different from that of jagirdars that status had at least been modified by section of the Marwar Land Revenue Act No XL of which had the effect of putting them in the same position as <ORG> grantees and that therefore their tenure fell within the operation of article A either as a jagir or other similar grant In <NAME> <ORG> which was cited by Mr <NAME> as authority in support of the above propo sition it was held by <ORG> that a law of the <ORG> curtailing the rights which a talukdar held under a sanad from the <ORG> was intra vires He quoted the following statement of the law in Halsbury Laws of England Volume VII page para Contracts may be either express or implied and of the latter there are two broad divisions the term implied contract in English law being applied not only to contracts which are inferred from the conduct or presumed intention of the parties of which examples have already been given but also to obligations imposed by implication of law quite apart from and without regard to the probable intention of the parties and sometimes even in opposition to their ex pressed or presumed intention We however agree with the respondent that for the purpose of article A it would make no difference Whether the grant is made by the sovereign in the exercise of his prerogative right or by the <ORG> in the exercise of its sovereign rights But it is argued for the petitioners that they are outside its scope because jagir in that article must be interpreted in a specific sense as otherwise there was no need to mention tenures like Bhom Sasan and Dolis which would be jagirs in a generic sense and that further <NAME> could not be brought within the category of similar proprietary interests because in the context similar interests must mean interests held under a grant Having considered the matter carefully we are not satisfied that there is any ground for cutting down the scope of the section in the manner contended for by the petitioners In Marwar Tenancy Act No XXXIX of section defines landlord as including a <NAME> jagirdai and in view of the fact that both this Act and Act No XL of were part of a comprehensive scheme of legislation that both of them came into force on and that section I of Act No XL of enacts that the words and expressions used therein are to have the same meaning as in Act No XXXIX of it would be safe to assume that the word jagir was used in section as including <NAME> tenures Scheduled jagirs are those which are governed by the rule of primogeniture Then there is the third category of jagirs which devolve on heirs under the ordinary Hindu law and are partible But where as here the language is clear and the meaning plain effect must be given to it In the result it must be held to fall within section and therefore within the operation of article A It is argued for the respondent that Bhomicharas are allowed to continue in possession of the land only on condition that they pay this amount annually and that it is therefore payment made in respect of lands held by them It appears from the Gazetteer of Mallani by Major <NAME> at page that the <ORG> amount has been apportioned among the several holders and it is contended for the respondent that as this apportionment has been communicated to <ORG> and accepted by it and acted upon there has been separate assessment of revenue It would appear from this account that the position of the Bhumias in Mewar is in many respects similar to that of <ORG>icharas in Marwar Section enacts that all lands belong to <NAME> and that no person has authority to take possession of any land unless the right is granted by <NAME> Section occurs in Chapter XI which is headed The rights of jagirdars Muafidar and Bhumias in Tikana jagir muafi and <ORG> lands and enacts that a Tikanadar jagirdar muafidar or Bhumia shall have all such revenue rights in the lands comprised in his jagir muafi or <ORG> under this Act as are granted to him by <NAME> Then follow provisions relating to succession and transfer of their tenures by jagirdars muafidars or Bhumias It was next contended by the petitioners that the Kanoon Mal Act No of was void because on a Constitution had been established in Mewar which provided that no person shall be deprived of his life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall any person be denied equality before the law within the territories of Mewar There is no substance in this belated contention and it must be rejected Mr <NAME> appearing for some of the Mewar petitioners contended that their status was that of Chiefs with semi sovereign powers and that it could not be said that they held the lands under grants from the State and and for compensation being awarded to them for taking over their right to manufacture salt vide Aitchison Treaties Vol He argued that the payments made by them to the <ORG> were not revenue but their contribution for purposes of common defence and that that had not the effect of reducing their status as feudatory chiefs to that of subordinate tenure holders His contention is that he is a ruler with semi sovereign status subject only to the obligation to render military service and to pay tribute called Maumla to the <ORG> of Jaipur that be is accordingly a Maumlaguzar and not jagirdar and that he is not a grantee from the <ORG> There was a corresponding rise in the status of the sub lessees who continued in possession of the estate as permanent grantees Even after the conclusion of the agreement of there were disputes between the Maharajah and the Chiefs in respect of various matters such as the right of the ruler to revise the amount payable by the Tikanadars and the right of the latter to minerals and to customs but this did not affect the nature of the relationship established between them under the agreement of In the ruler of Isarda acknowledged the suzerainty of the Maharaja of Jaipur who in turn recognised the ancestor of the petitioner as <NAME> subject to a liability to pay tribute every year to Jaipur Isarda was a new State founded by <NAME> and its area was extended from time to time by incorporation of fresh villages and when in the Chief acknowledged the suzerainty of Jaipur and held the estate as subeguzar under him that title must have related to the entire estate including these villages and there is therefore no ground for treating them differently from the rest As regards the others there is no specific case put forward as to the nature of their tenure The grant is described in the deed as jagir and the Gazette Notification dated publishing it states We are also faced with the problem of arranging for our second <NAME> a <NAME> which in the matter of size and powers should be on a much higher footing than the existing <NAME>s Under section a of the Alwar <ORG> Revenue Code estate means an area for which there is a separate record of rights or which is treated as such under orders of <NAME> Government But it is argued that it is a case of casus omissus and that it is not within the province of this Court to supply it There was no need for exempting them under section if the <ORG> did not understand them as falling within the operation of section a and they would fall under that section only if the word <NAME> is interpreted as meaning all persons who hold properties which are jagirs as defined in the Act Then there are provisions for assessment of land revenue It is argued for the petitioners that the record of rights as contemplated by section has not been made and that the lands have not been assessed to revenue nor has it been released com pounded for or redeemed and that therefore the properties are not estates within section of the Bikaner Act No IV of In Petitions Nos and of there are no such admissions there being no schedules to the petitions But in the petitions for stay of notification filed in all the above petitions it is alleged that notification under the impugned Act with respect to the jagir of the petitioners has not yet been made Petition No of In this petition there are petitioners some of whom are from Kishangarh which will clearly bring them within the operation of article A It is stated that the th petitioner <NAME> does not make any payment in respect of his estate and that it is not a jagir Petition No of The petitioner is the holder of an estate in Mewar known as Bhaisrodgarh Tikana and he alleges that there was a dispute between <NAME> the then holder of the estate and the Maharajah of Udaipur and that it was settled in March through the mediation of the then Agent to the Government Sir <NAME> and that under the terms of the settlement the Tikana was recognised as the exclusive property of the holder The agreement itself has not been produced and it could not even on the allegations in the petition have had the effect of destroying the character of the estate as a jagir grant We have held that maintenance grants would be jagirs according to their extended connotation and they are therefore within article A It was suggested that the question whether Lawazma and Kothrikharch are tenures different from those mentioned in the schedule to the Act might be left open and that the right of the petitioners to establish their contention in other proceedings may be reserved But then there are no allegations in the petition that the properties were held under a tenure which is outside the schedule to the Act for her maintenance and in lieu of it the village of Bagri with its hamlets Anwarpura and Ismailpura was granted to her by resolution dated Mr <NAME> who appeared for the petitioner put forward a special con tention that the Government was estopped from resuming the lands The Act confers no authority on the <ORG> to grant exemption from resumption and an undertaking not to resume will be invalid and there can be no estoppel against a statute One other contention advanced with reference to this petition might be noticed It was argued that under rule in schedule II no compensation is awarded in respect of the <ORG> lands which remain in the possession of the jagirdar whereas if they are sold the income from the sale proceeds is taken into account Petition No of relates to the estate of <NAME> in Jaipur and it is contended that it is not an estate because the liability of the holder is only to pay <NAME> and it is argued that this is not revenue He describes himself as owner of the properties in Khera as jagirdar admits in paras and that the estate is a jagir and prays for an injunction restraining the <ORG> from interfering with his rights as jagirdar There are petitioners and it is argued that the payments made by them called chakri chatund and Bhom barad are not revenue and their properties are not estates of the gross income may be deducted for administrative charges inclusive of the cost of collection maintenance of land records management of jagir lands and irrecoverable arrears of rent and there is a proviso to that rule that in no case shall the net income be computed at a figure less than per cent In addition to this there is provision for the payment of rehabilitation grant on the scale mentioned in schedule III But we have held that the impugned Act is protected by article A and that article enacts that no law providing for acquisition of properties falling within its purview is open to attack on the ground that it violates any of the provisions of Part III There is considerable force in this con tention It was also argued that there was no public purpose involved in the resumption and that therefore article had been contravened The contention of the petitioners is that the Act according to its title is one to provide for resumption of jagir lands not all of them that section provides that the <ORG> may appoint a date for the resumption of any class of jagir lands which means that under this section it is not obligatory on it to resume all jagirs and that it would be within its powers in resuming some of them while leaving others untouched and thus the Act is discriminatory The provisions of this Act bearing on this question are sections and We have held that the Act confers no power on the <ORG> to grant exemption It was also urged that under section the <ORG> is authorised to resume different classes of jagir lands on different dates and that must result in the law operating unequally Petitions Nos and of These are petitions by jagirdars of Mewar and the special contention urged on their behalf by Mr <NAME> is that their jagirs had been taken possession of by the State in under section A of the Rajasthan Ordinance No There is no substance in this contention There is no ground therefore for holding that the Act in any manner contravenes article The contention that is urged on his behalf by Mr <NAME> is that the Act does not apply to him because be is neither a Jagirdar nor a holder of any of the tenures mentioned in schedule I to the Act Thereafter it was leased to the Chieftain of Sikar and others on short Term leases till when the grant under which the petitioner claims was made There was an enquiry and report by Mr <NAME> in and on that report the matter was again in vestigated by a Committee which submitted its report in But the report emphasises that the grantee held as istimrar Izaradar and not as istimrar Muamlaguzar and in the context the word istimrar has reference not to the character of the tenure but its duration as permanent And if that is answered in the affirmative the Act would clearly apply and it would make no difference in the result that the holder derived title to them by purchase and not by inheritance We may add that this contention was raised by the petitioner in a supplemental statement But the grant will clearly be a jagir as there is an assignment of land revenue for the rendering of military service and <ORG> is only another name for a jagir With reference to one of the villages forming part of this estate Jorpura a special contention was put forward by Mr <NAME> that it was dedicated for worship of the Devi and was therefore within the exemption enacted in section Petition No of The petitioners are interested in two of the villages Dadia Rampur and Tapiplya comprised in the izara of Khandela of the year which forms the subject matter of Petition No of and their title rests on Chhut Bhayas or sub grant from the izaradar There has been no denial by the respondent of the allegation in the petition and on the materials placed before us we have come to the conclusion that the dedication pleaded by the petitioner has been established and that the properties are within the exemption enacted in section To sum up The impugned Act is not open to attack either on the ground that the <ORG> had no legislative competence to enact it or that the procedure prescribed in article A for enactment of laws had not been followed In Petition No of the right of the petitioner to claim exemption under section for the village of Jorpura on the ground that it is dedicated for worship of the Deity is reserved and the petition is otherwise dismissed The parties will bear their own costs in all the petitions
