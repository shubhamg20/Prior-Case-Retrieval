I do not think the word judgment is used in contradistinction to the worlds sentence or order which immediately follow it The words not being a sentence or order passed or made in any criminal trial as it seems to me were introduced in order to exclude all criminal proceedings from the operation of the section and that it is not to be inferred from the introduction of these words that the legislature intended that the word judgment should include all orders in civil proceedings An adjudication on an application which is nothing more than a step towards obtaining a final adjudication in the suit is not in my opinion a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent An order made on an application which is interlocutory in point of form may be a judgment within the meaning of Section of the Letters Patent On the other hand I am not prepared to say as was held in The Justices of the Peace for Calcutta The Oriental Gas Company Beng and in Sonbai Ahmedbhai Habibhai it must be a decision which effects the merits by determining some right or liability With all respect I think the definition of judgment given by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> as any decision or determination affecting the rights or the interest of any suitor or applicant is too wide and I cannot accede to the proposition that it is impossible to prescribe any limits to the right of appeal founded upon the nature of the order or decree appealed from I agree however with the actual decision in the ease which seems to me to satisfy the test which I have ventured to lay down I think the order may be regarded as an order which put an end to a proceeding in which the Administrator General claimed commission at a certain rate and was therefore appealable an order dismissing an application by the assignee of a plaintiff to be brought on the record held appealable and in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad an order dismissing a petition to receive a sum of money as security for coats of an appeal held appealable in my opinion satisfy the test I have suggested As regards the latter case I entirely agree with the observation of the learned Judges that the fact that the making of the order was a matter of discretion does not affect the appealability of the order This fact may be a good reason for refusing to exercise the appellate jurisdiction but as it seems to me it is no reason for holding that the appellate jurisdiction does not exist I think an appeal would lie from an order refusing to extend the time for giving security for costs as the effect of the order would be to put an end to the appeal an order was made setting aside a judgment and a decree and ordering a remand and this order was held to be appealable where it was held that an appeal lay from an order dismissing a Judge summons to show cause why leave granted under Clause of the Letters Patent should not be rescinded and the plaint taken off the file Here the adjudication asked for if made would have disposed of the suit So also would an order made on an application to revoke a submission to arbitration I agree with the view expressed by <NAME> <NAME> in Ebtahim Fuckhrunnissa Begum I Calc The meaning of the word judgment has often come up for consideration in this Court and the cases show a considerable diversity of opinion Apart from the question of the true signification of that word in clautse there has also been considerable difficulty in the application of the definition to the facts of individual cases It is necessary to understand the use of the term judgment in Clause in such a manner as to give effect to the several words above noted that are employed in the Letters Patent the provisions as to appeals in the Code applies to cases in which appeals lie from one court to another and not from one member of a court to other members of the same court There is no doubt that the adjudication of a right or liability which determines a suit or appeal is a judgment Even a refusal to adjudicate which puts an end to a particular suit or appeal must equally amount to a judgment Even though the proceeding is not a suit or appeal as technically understood but is only what may be called an original petition like an application for a succession certificate or the appointment of a guardian the pronouncement which terminates the proceeding has the characteristics of a judgment though there is a formal difference in the designation of the proceeding see Rule Moffussil Rules of Practice But the right of liability with reference to which the court adjudicates or declines to do so must be the substantive claim or liability and not as Mr <NAME> tried to maintain a right to a particular judicial procedure or a detriment suffered in being danied the benefit of a rule of procedure Preliminary or interlocutory judgments which ascertain rights and direct further inquiries which determine liabilities though further directions are given for ascertaining the measure of those liabilities must be deemed to fall within Clause I am unable to agree with Mr <NAME> that interlocutory judgments which decide the merits are not judgments under Section But they are remedies though provisional in their character and the judicial determination of those proceedings may well be deemed to be analogous to the disposal of original petitions which determines the rights of parties An appeal was specially provided from such orders even in the code of and the decisions in such cases may well be treated as interlocutory judgments Cases of stay of execution or security for costs whether the order is in favour of one party or another must stand on the same footing as temporarily affecting the rights of parties So far as I have been able to discover there are only four or five decisions in which an endeavour has been made to arrive at a definition of the term judgment as used in Clause of the letters Patent The decision in <ORG> for Calcutta <ORG> Beng <NAME> says We think judgment in Clause means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability It may be either final or preliminary or interlocutory the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it leaving other matters to be determined The two very learned Judges who decided that case held that the term meant any derision or determination affecting the rights or the interest of any suitor or applicant But Sir <NAME> proceeds to say at page when the language giving the appeal is so general in its terms as that contained in the fifteenth clause of the chapter it is we think impossible to prescribe any limits to the right of appeal founded upon the nature of the order or decree appealed from But they regarded a refusal to interfere as no judgment It was said that the <ORG> had a discretion to interfere and a refusal to exercise a discretion was no judgment This raises a question as to whether the refusal to exercise a discretion does not involve the application of the judicial mind as much as a decision in the exercise of discretion in which letter case <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> refused to entertain an appeal from an order refusing leave to appeal in forma pauperis because it was within the discration of the <ORG> to grant or refuse such leave it was held that <ORG> had rightly entertained the appeal under Section from the order of the single Judge who refused to transmit the order of <ORG> for execution And we think it may be stated as a general rule that when the determination complained of is merely the result of the exercise of discretion on the part of the Judge in a matter which was a proper subject for the exercise of that discretion the appellate <ORG> would rightly decline to interfere the order of adjournment was certainly not appealable But an appeal lay as regards the application to vary the rate of alimony and though the definition of judgment there was certainly open to exception the order of adjournment itself was not varied in appeal where a single Judge had set aside a decree for rent in part and called for a report as to the remainder there was at least an interlocutory judgment from which an appeal was rightly held to lie It appears to me that the sounder view is that of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I have already dealt with the argument derived from the discretionary character of the order It is difficult to distinguish in principle between an order staying execution or refusing to stay it and an order directing security for the costs of an appeal during its pendency that an appeal lay from an order refusing to extend time for the giving of security for the costs of an appeal and from an order directing security to be given A full examination of the cases cited on both sides leads me to the conclusion that no appeal lies from the order of Mr Justice <NAME> in the present case
