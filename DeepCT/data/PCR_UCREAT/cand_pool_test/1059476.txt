However the Act of was enacted and enforced vires of which is in question more particularly the provisions as contained in Sections and of the Act Besides others we may for the sake of convenience refer to the averments made and documents filed in Transferred Case Nos of <ORG> It appears that a notice dated July was issued to the petitioner <ORG> by <ORG> for short the <ORG> under Section of the Ordinance then in force requiring it to pay the amount of arrears indicated in the notice within days failing which the <ORG> as a secured creditor would be entitled to enforce the security interest without intervention of the court or <ORG> taking recourse to all or any of the measures contained in sub section of Section namely by taking over possession and or management of the secured assets Similar notices were issued by other financial institutions and banks under the provisions of Section of the Ordinance Act to different parties who filed petitions in different High Courts The term borrower has been defined in clause of Section which provides as under borrower means any person who has been granted financial assistance by any bank or financial institution or who has given any guarantee or created any mortgage or pledge as security for the financial assistance granted by any bank or financial institution and includes a person who becomes borrower of a securitisation company or reconstruction company consequent upon acquisition by it of any rights or interest of any bank or financial institution in relation to such financial assistance Similarly the term default is defined in clause as quoted below default means non payment of any principal debt or interest thereon or any other amount payable by a borrower to any secured creditor consequent upon which the account of such borrower is classified as non performing asset in the books of account of the secured creditor in accordance with the directions or guidelines issued by <ORG> Section which is relevant for our present purpose provides Enforcement of security interest Notwithstanding anything contained in section or section A of the Transfer of Property Act any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the intervention of the court or tribunal by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act Where any borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security agreement makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any instalment thereof and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor within sixty days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under sub section In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in sub section the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt namely a take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realizing the secured asset take over the management of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale and realize the secured asset appoint any person hereafter referred to as the manager to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor require at any time by notice in writing any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower to pay the secured creditor so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt Any payment made by any person referred to in clause of sub section to the secured creditor shall give such person a valid discharge as if he has made payment to the borrower Where any action has been taken against a borrower under the provisions of sub section all costs charges and expenses which in the opinion of the secured creditor have been properly incurred by him or any expenses incidental thereto shall be recoverable from the borrower and the money which is received by the secured creditor shall in the absence of any contract to the contrary be held by him in trust to be applied firstly in payment of such costs charges and expenses and secondly in discharge of the dues of the secured creditor and the residue of the money so received shall be paid to the person entitled thereto in accordance with his rights and interests Xxx xxx xxx Where dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied with the sale proceeds of the secured assets the secured creditor may file an application in the form and manner as may be prescribed to <ORG> having jurisdiction or a competent court as the case may be for recovery of the balance amount from the borrower Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in the Transferred Case submits that there was no occasion to enact such a draconian legislation to find a short cut to realize the dues without their ascertainment but which the secured creditor considered to be the dues and declare the same as non performing assets NPAs Therefore it was not necessary to enact yet another legislation containing drastic steps and procedure depriving the debtors of any fair opportunity to defend themselves from the onslaught of the harsh steps as provided under the Act It is further submitted that no provision has been made to take into account the lenders liability though at one time it was considered necessary to have an enactment relating to lenders liability and a bill was also intended to be introduced as it was considered that it is necessary for the lenders as well to conduct themselves responsibly towards the borrowers Referring to Section of the Act it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that a security interest can be enforced by the secured creditor straightaway without intervention of the court just on default in repayment of an instalment and non compliance of a notice of days in that regard declaring the loan as non performing asset Under sub section of Section the secured creditor is entitled to take possession of the secured assets and may transfer the same by way of lease assignment or sale as provided under clause a or under clause to take over the management of the secured assets including the right to transfer any secured assets or to appoint any person as provided in clause to manage the secured assets taken over by the creditor Under clause by means of a notice any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower or who has to pay to the borrower any amount which may cover the secured debt can be asked to pay it to the secured creditor All that is provided is that if all the dues with costs and charges and expenses incurred by the creditor is tendered before the date fixed for sale of the assets no further steps shall be taken for sale of the property It is submitted that the mechanism provided for recovery of the debt under Section indicated above does not provide for any adjudicatory forum to resolve any dispute which may arise in relation to the liability of the borrower to be treated as a defaulter or to see as to whether there has been any violation or lapse on the part of the creditor or in regard to the correctness of the amount sought to be recovered and the interest levied thereupon On the other hand Section bars the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain any suit in respect of any matter which <ORG> or the appellate <ORG> is empowered to determine It also provides that no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under Act or under the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act Section gives an overriding effect to the provisions of the Act over the provisions contained under any other law The submission therefore is that before any action is taken under Section there is no forum or adjudicatory mechanism to resolve any dispute which may arise in respect of the alleged dues or the <ORG> It is further submitted that after the possession of the secured assets or its management has been taken over by the secured creditor or the property is leased out or sold to any other person it would not be possible to raise and deposit of the amount claimed by the secured creditor It is also submitted that once the secured assets are taken over there is hardly any occasion for deposit of of the claim since it is already secured and the management and the possession of the secured assets moves into the hands of the creditor In so far it relates to Section of the Act which provides in case it is found that possession of the secured assets was wrongfully taken by the secured creditor he may be directed to return the secured assets to the borrower who may also be entitled to such compensation as may be determined by <ORG> or the appellate <ORG> it is submitted that it is hardly a consolation after harsh steps as provided under sub section of section have been taken But there is no adjudicatory body provided for dealing with such disputes But there are cases where there is no lis or two contending parties before a statutory authority yet such a statutory authority has been held to be quasi judicial and decision rendered by it as a quasi judicial decision when such a statutory authority is required to act judicially And if there be a body empowered by law to enquire into facts making estimates to impose a rate on a district it would seem to me that the acts of such a body involving such consequences would be judicial acts It is submitted that power to decide a lis is a judicial or quasi judicial power and not purely an administrative power In that connection reliance has also been placed on a case reported in Suppl It is submitted any power which is exercised by a party to enforce security by way of sale etc <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the guarantors of the principal borrower refers to Section of the Act to indicate that the definition of the word borrower covers even the guarantor The petitioner received a notice under Section of the Act It is submitted that if property is subject to several charge as first charge second charge and third charge and so on property in relation to only one of them would be NPA and not in relation to other creditors having charge over the property He also refers to Section of the Transfer of Property Act which deals with the case of transfer by one co owner and the difficulty to work out the provisions of the Act in such cases It has been felt that after coming into force of the Act there is a marked difference in realization of dues and more borrowers are coming forward to pay up the defaulted amount and clear the dues It is submitted that in case a defaulter wants to raise any objection it may be raised in reply to the notice which would obviously be considered by the secured creditor before it would further proceed to take recourse to sub section of Section of the Act The remedy as provided under Section of the Act it is adequate and the condition of deposit of of the claim before the appeal could be entertained is not an unusual condition and it is to be found in other statutes also It is then submitted that normally there should be a presumption in favour of validity of a legislation more so in regard to the laws relating to economic and financial matters and a few instances here and there of any harsh results would not be a valid consideration to invalidate the law <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the <ORG> submits that the purpose of enacting the Act would be self evident from the statement of objects and reasons for the enactment which reads as under The financial sector has been one of the key drivers in India efforts to achieve success in rapidly developing its economy While banking industry in India is progressively complying with the international prudential norms and accounting practices there are certain areas in which the banking and financial sector do not have a level playing field as compared to other participants in the financial markets in the world There is no legal provision for facilitating securitisation of financial assets of banks and financial institutions Further unlike international banks the banks and financial institutions in India do not have power to take possession of securities and sell them Our existing legal framework relating to commercial transactions has not kept pace with the changing commercial practices and financial sector reforms This has resulted in slow pace of recovery of defaulting loans and mounting levels of non performing assets of banks and financial institutions <ORG> and II and <ORG> constituted by <ORG> for the purpose of examining banking sector reforms have considered the need for changes in the legal system in respect of these areas It is submitted that the question of enactment of the Act was under consideration for long and first <ORG> and then <ORG> were constituted by the central government for introducing reforms in the banking sector necessary for recovery of the outstanding dues of the financial institutions It is submitted that in England a mortgagee under a legal mortgage has a right to take possession to sell and even appoint a receiver in relation to mortgaged properties without recourse to a court of law It is also submitted that provisions as contained under Section of the Act are also valid In so far the provisions contained under Section of the Act and the challenge made to it it is submitted that it is referable to Section and not to Section a of the Act It is submitted that the provisions as contained in Chapter III of the Act are in keeping with provisions as contained under Section of the Transfer of Property Act regarding sale of security interest without intervention of the court like Section of the State Financial Corporation Act and Section of the Contract Act It is submitted that the relationship between secured creditor and the borrower is a contractual relationship and no question of adjudication arises at the stage of Section of the Act As indicated earlier arguments on the same lines were advanced by some of the counsels and others adopted the same Taking an overall view of the rival contentions of the parties we feel the main questions which broadly fall for consideration by us are i Whether it is open to challenge the statute on the ground that it was not necessary to enact it in the prevailing background particularly when another statute was already in operation ii Whether provisions as contained under Section and of the Act provide adequate and efficacious mechanism to consider and decide the objections disputes raised by a borrower against the recovery particularly in view of bar to approach the civil court under Section of the Act iii Whether the remedy available under Section of the Act is illusory for the reason it is available only after the action is taken under Section of the Act and the appeal would be entertainable only on deposit of of the claim raised in the notice of demand iv Whether the terms or existing rights under the contract entered into by two private parties could be amended by the provisions of law providing certain powers in one sided manner in favour of one of the parties to the contract Whether provision for sale of the properties without intervention of the court under Section of the Act is akin to the English mortgage and its effect on the scope of the bar of the jurisdiction of the civil court vi Whether the provisions under Sections and of the Act are unconstitutional on the basis of the parameters laid down in different decisions of this Court vii Whether the principle of lender liability has been absolutely ignored while enacting the Act and its effect Though it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that it so happened due to inaction on the part of the governments in creating Debt Recovery Tribunals and appointing Presiding Officers for a long time Hence in our view it cannot be said that a step taken towards securitisation of the debts and to evolve means for faster recovery of the NPAs was not called for or that it was superimposition of undesired law since one legislation was already operating in the field namely the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act It appears that a thought was given to the problems and <ORG> was constituted which recommended for such a legislation keeping in view the changing times and economic situation whereafter yet another expert committee was constituted then alone the impugned law was enacted But certainly what must be kept in mind is that the law should not be in derogation of the rights which are guaranteed to the people under the Constitution It was also observed that the assets are required to be classified it also takes note of the fact that <ORG> had classified the advances of a bank one category of which was bad debts doubtful debts It is thus to be seen that the question of non recoverable or delayed recovery of debts advanced by the banks or financial institutions has been attracting the attention and the matter was considered in depth by the committees specially constituted consisting of the experts in the field In the prevalent situation where the amount of dues are huge and hope of early recovery is less it cannot be said that a more effective legislation for the purpose was uncalled for or that it could not be resorted to We are therefore unable to find much substance in the submission made on behalf of the petitioners that while the Recovery of debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act was in operation it was uncalled for to have yet another legislation for the recovery of the mounting dues Next we come to the question as to whether it is on whims and fancies of the financial institutions to classify the assets as non performing assets as canvassed before us it was decided to dispense with past due concept with effect from March Accordingly as from that date a Non performing Asset NPA shall be an advance where i interest and or installment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than days in respect of a Term Loan ii the account remains out of order for a period of more than days in respect of an Overdraft Cash Credit OD CC iii the bill remains overdue for a period of more than days in the case of bills purchased and discounted iv interest and or installment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons but for a period not exceeding two half years in the case of an advance granted for agricultural purposes and any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than days in respect of other accounts Therefore we find no substance in the submission made on behalf of the petitioners that there are no guidelines for treating the debt as a non performing asset We may now consider the main enforcing provision which is pivotal to the whole controversy namely Section in Chapter III of the Act It may also be noted that as per sub section of Section a notice given to the borrower must contain the details of the amounts payable and the secured assets against which the secured creditor proposes to proceed in the event of non compliance with the notice given under sub section of Section Sub section provides for four measures which can be taken by the secured creditor in case of non compliance with the notice served upon the borrower Under clause a of sub section the secured creditor may take possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer the secured assets by way of lease assignment or sale may take over the management of the secured assets under clause including right to transfer under clause of sub section a manager may be appointed to manage the secured assets which have been taken possession of by the secured creditor and may require any person who has acquired any secured assets from the borrower or from whom any money is due to the borrower to pay the same to him as it may be sufficient to pay the secured debtor as provided under Clause of Section of the Act Now coming to Section it provides for filing of an appeal to <ORG> within days of any action taken against the borrower under sub section of Section of the Act Any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditor or his authorized officer under this Chapter may prefer an appeal to <ORG> having jurisdiction in the matter within forty five days from the date on which such measures had been taken Where an appeal is preferred by a borrower such appeal shall not be entertained by <ORG> unless the borrower has deposited with <ORG> seventy five per cent of the amount claimed in the notice referred to in sub section of section Provided that <ORG> may for reasons to be recorded in writing waive or reduce the amount to be deposited under this section Save as otherwise provided in this Act <ORG> shall as far as may be dispose of the appeal in accordance with the provisions of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act of and rules made thereunder So far jurisdiction of Civil Court is concerned we find that there is a bar to it as provided under Section of the Act quoted below Civil Court not to have jurisdiction No Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which <ORG> or <ORG> is empowered by or under this Act to determine and no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this Act or under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act of Mainly it is to be considered as to whether there is absolute bar of any remedy to the borrower before an action is taken under sub section of Section of the Act in view of non obstante clause under sub section of Section and the bar of the jurisdiction of the civil court under Section of the Act A mortgagee or any person acting on his behalf shall subject to the provisions of this section have power to sell or concur in selling the mortgaged property or any part thereof in default of the payment of mortgage money without the intervention of the <ORG> in the following cases and in no others namely a where the mortgage is an English mortgage and neither the mortgagor nor the mortgagee is a Hindu Mohammadan or Buddhist or a member of any other race sect tribe or class from time to time specified in this behalf by <ORG> in the Official Gazette where a power of sale without the intervention of the <ORG> is expressly conferred on the mortgagee by the mortgage deed and the mortgagee is the Government where a power of sale without the intervention of the <ORG> is expressly conferred on the mortgagee by mortgage deed and the mortgaged property or any part thereof was on the date of the execution of the mortgage deed situate within the towns of Calcutta Madras Bombay or in any other town or area which the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette specify in this behalf No such power shall be exercised unless and until a notice in writing requiring payment of the principal money has been served on the mortgagor or on one of several mortgagors and default has been made in payment of the principal money or of part thereof for three months after such service or some interest under the mortgage amounting at least to five hundred rupees is in arrear and unpaid for three months after becoming due When a sale has been made in professed exercise of such a power the title of the purchaser shall not be impeachable on the ground that no case had arisen to authorize the sale or that due notice was not given or that the power was otherwise improperly or irregularly exercised but any person damnified by an unauthorized or improper or irregular exercise of the power shall have his remedy in damages against the person exercising the power Xxx xxx xxx It is thus pointed out that in English mortgage absolute transfer of the property already takes place There are different kinds of mortgages as enumerated in section of the Transfer of Property Act We feel that it would not be necessary to further go into the matter as to whether the agreements in the cases before us amount to English mortgage or not since the non obstante clause under Section of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Section a secured interest can be enforced without intervention of the court That is to say it overrides the provision as contained under Section where it is said that in no cases other than those as enumerated in clauses a and a mortgage shall be enforced without intervention of the court Once the said condition as noted above in section of the Transfer of Property Act the general law on the subject has been overridden by the special enactment namely the Securitisation Act it would not make much of a difference as to whether the transactions in question are akin to or amount to English mortgage or not since irrespective of the kind of the mortgage the secured interest is liable to be enforced without intervention of the court as per the provision contained under Section of the Act The provisions of this Act to override other laws The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law It may however be worthwhile to mention here as to why and in what circumstances it had been thought necessary to provide a non obstante clause in sub section of Section of the Act In this connection it has been pointed out on behalf of the respondents that <ORG> was appointed by <ORG> which submitted its report in indicating the effect of the changed situation and the relevance of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act in context thereof Mr <NAME> has drawn our attention to the <ORG> report as quoted in the Narasimham Committee Report which reads as under <ORG> appointed by <ORG> gave its report in pointing out the development of the law of mortgages and explaining how it had become completely anachronistic in the latter part of the th century where mortgages had become a very important instrument to facilitate development of commercial credit If there is any difficulty or any objection pointed out by the borrower by means of some appropriate internal mechanism it must be expeditiously resolved The creditor must apply its mind to the objections raised in reply to such notice and an internal mechanism must be particularly evolved to consider such objections raised in the reply to the notice Once such a duty is envisaged on the part of the creditor it would only be conducive to the principles of fairness on the part of the banks and financial institutions in dealing with their borrowers to apprise them of the reason for not accepting the objections or points raised in reply to the notice served upon them before proceeding to take measures under sub section of Section Such reasons overruling the objections of the borrower must also be communicated to the borrower by the secured creditor At the same time more importantly we must make it clear unequivocally that communication of the reasons not accepting the objections taken by the secured borrower may not be taken to give an occasion to resort to such proceedings which are not permissible under the provisions of the Act But communication of reasons not to accept the objections of the borrower would certainly be for the purpose of his knowledge which would be a step forward towards his right to know as to why his objections have not been accepted by the secured creditor who intends to resort to harsh steps of taking over the management business of viz It is true as per the provisions under the Act he may not be entitled to challenge the reasons communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at that point of time unless his right to approach <ORG> as provided under Section of the Act matures on any measure having been taken under sub section of Section of the Act We are holding that it is necessary to communicate the reasons for not accepting the objections raised by the borrower in reply to notice under Section of the Act more particularly for the reason that normally in the event of non compliance with notice the party giving notice approaches the court to seek redressal but in the present case in view of Section of the Act the creditor is empowered to enforce the security himself without intervention of the <ORG> Therefore it goes with logic and reason that he may be checked to communicate the reason for not accepting the objections if raised and before he takes the measures like taking over possession of the secured assets etc Such a right accrues only after measures are taken under sub section of Section of the Act On behalf of one of the respondents <NAME> submitted that as a matter of fact Section of the Act leaves more scope and provides wider protection to the borrower as compared to in the case of English mortgage and in connection with the above submission it has been pointed out that in case of an English mortgage there is no scope of intervention of the court unless a case is made out before the court that action of the mortgagee is fraudulent or it is a case of the like nature Whereas it is submitted under the Securitisation rules it is provided that before putting the property on sale the authorized officer has to obtain the valuation of immovable property a reserved price is to be fixed and a notice of days before sale is to be served on the borrower No sale of immovable property under these rules shall take place before the expiry of thirty days from the date on which the public notice of sale is published in newspapers as referred to in the proviso to sub rule or notice of sale has been served to the borrower It has also been submitted that an appeal is entertainable before <ORG> only after such measures as provided in sub section of Section are taken and Section bars to entertain any proceeding in respect of a matter which <ORG> or the appellate <ORG> is empowered to determine Thus before any action or measure is taken under sub section of Section it is submitted by Mr <NAME> one of the counsel for respondents that there would be no bar to approach the civil court A full reading of section shows that the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred in respect of matters which a Debt Recovery <ORG> or appellate <ORG> is empowered to determine in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred under this Act That is to say the prohibition covers even matters which can be taken cognizance of by <ORG> though no measure in that direction has so far been taken under sub section of Section Therefore any matter in respect of which an action may be taken even later on the civil court shall have no jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding thereof The bar of civil court thus applies to all such matters which may be taken cognizance of by <ORG> apart from those matters in which measures have already been taken under sub section of Section The mortgagor can come to the <ORG> before sale with an injunction for staying the sale if there are materials to show that the power of sale is being exercised in a fraudulent or improper manner contrary to the terms of the mortgage I need not point out that this restraint on the exercise of the power of sale will be exercised by <ORG>s only under the limited circumstances mentioned above because otherwise to grant such an injunction would be to cancel one of the clauses of the deed to which both the parties had agreed and annul one of the chief securities on which persons advancing moneys on mortgages rely We also find it appropriate to mention at this stage that in reply to submission made by Shri <NAME> on behalf of the guarantors that even though a guarantor may stand discharged as envisaged under Sections and of the Indian Contracts Act eg where any variance in terms of the contract has been made without his consent then too guarantor may be proceeded against and he will have no right to raise an objection before measures have been taken against him under Section of the Act nor he could approach the civil court It is submitted by the respondent in such cases civil court may have jurisdiction to entertain the case as character as a guarantor itself is denied In so far the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners that by virtue of the provisions contained under sub section of Section the borrowers lose their right of redemption of the mortgage We may then turn to the arguments raised on behalf of the petitioners that the remedy before <ORG> under Section of the Act is illusory burdened with onerous and oppressive condition of deposit of of the amount of the demand notice before an appeal can be entertained by the <ORG> Much stress has been given in reply to the proviso to sub section of Section according to which the <ORG> has power to waive or reduce the amount Therefore the condition of deposit is a condition of impossibility which renders the remedy made available before the <ORG> as nugatory and illusory It is further submitted that such a condition of pre deposit has been held to be valid by this Court earlier and a reference has been made to a decisions reported in SCC at <ORG> State of Gujarat to submit that such a provision is made to regulate the exercise of the right of an appeal conferred upon a person SCC Seth Nandlal Vs State of Haryana there was no provision for a waiver or reduction of amount of pre deposit it is submitted even that the provision was held to be valid as the purpose was to prevent frivolous appeals and revisions which impedes the implementation of the ceiling policy We also find that there are further observations to the effect that the condition is for the purpose to act in torrorem to make the people comply with the provisions of the law The submission is that such a provision as that of pre deposit before maintaining an appeal is not unknown to law and there are several other statutes containing similar provisions We may refer to a decision of this Court reported in SCC Smt There is a basic distinction between the right of suit and the right of appeal There is an inherent right in every person to bring a suit of civil nature and unless one choice The requirement of pre deposit of any amount at the first instance of proceedings is not to be found in any of the decisions cited on behalf of the respondent There is no such provision under the Act We find no merit in this submission too The condition of pre deposit in the present case is bad rendering the remedy illusory on the grounds that i it is imposed while approaching the adjudicating authority of the first instance not in appeal ii there is no determination of the amount due as yet iii the secured assets or its management with transferable interest is already taken over and under control of the secured creditor iv no special reason for double security in respect of an amount yet to be determined and settled of the amount claimed by no means would be a meager amount vi it will leave the borrower in a position where it would not be possible for him to raise any funds to make deposit of of the undetermined demand <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that so far it relates to the provision as contained under Section of the Act it is for the purposes of assets reconstruction It is submitted that the apprehensions as expressed that the defaulting party may set up an asset reconstruction company is misconceived nor there is any substance in the submission that company in default may constitute such a company to defeat the interest of the creditor What is envisaged under Section is the taking over of the management of the business of the borrower company and the provisions as contained under Section of the Act are referable to Section and not to Section of the Act Such a law it is submitted is not envisaged in any civilized society governed by rule of law Certain decisions which have been relied on behalf of the respondents on the point are SCR Ramaswamy Aiyengar Vs <NAME> In that case by enacting the Madras Agriculturalist Relief Act relief was given to the debtors who were agriculturists as a class by sealing down their debts The validity of the Act was upheld though it affected the individual interest of creditors By a statutory provision special benefit was conferred upon the tenants in Madras city where they had put up a building for residential or non residential purposes and were saved from eviction it did though affect the existing rights of the landlords In the present we find that case the unrealized dues of banking companies and financial institutions utilizing public money for advances were mounting and it was considered imperative in view of recommendations of experts committees to have such law which may provide speedier remedy before any major fiscal set back occurs and for improvement of general financial flow of money necessary for the economy of the country that the impugned Act was enacted Section of the Act bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts to entertain a suit in matters of recovery of loans The remedy of appeal available under the Act as contained in Section can be availed only after measures have already been taken by the secured creditor under sub section of Section of the Act which includes sale of the secured assets taking over its management and all transferable rights thereto On behalf of respondents time and again stress has been given on the contention that in a contractual matter between the two private parties they are supposed to act in terms of the contract and no question of compliance with the principles of natural justice arises nor the question of judicial review of such actions need to be provided for But we find that a contract which has been entered into between the two private parties in some respects has been superseded by the statutory provisions or it may be said that such contracts are now governed by the statutory provisions relating to recovery of debts and bar of jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain any dispute in respect of such matters At this stage we may also take note of the arguments raised on behalf of the petitioners that in the present day world concept of lender liability has also developed which cannot be ignored We have already referred to certain facts in relation to this point that at one stage a statement was made at the floor of the <ORG> that it was necessary to legislate on lender liability Certain decisions pertaining to the liability of the lenders have been cited on behalf of the petitioners and a few others by the learned counsel for the respondents Learned counsel for the petitioners emphatically submitted that the Act is loaded against the borrowers and no provision regarding the liability of the lenders has been made in the Act Whatever be the position however it cannot be denied that the financial institutions namely the lenders owe a duty to act fairly and in good faith <NAME> learned Attorney General submits that basically there is a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and unless it is found that a provision enacted results in palpably arbitrary consequences courts refrain from declaring the law invalid as legislated by the legislature He has particularly drawn our attention to the following passage The first rule is that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute This rule is based on the assumption judicially recognized and accepted that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience Every legislation particularly in economic matters is essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method There may be crudities and inequities in complicated experimental economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot be struck down as invalid The <ORG> must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions The <ORG> must defer to legislative judgment in matters relating to social and economic policies and must not interference unless the exercise of legislative judgment appears to be palpably arbitrary emphasis supplied It is however further observed in this decision that it may all depend upon the nature of the subject matter other available correctives and the possible harm flowing from the wrong orders In relation to the argument on behalf of the petitioners that they are entitled to be heard before a notice under sub section of Section is issued failing which there is denial of principles of natural justice a reference has been made to certain decisions to submit that in every case it is not necessary to make a provision for providing a hearing In regard to the submission made by the parties as indicated in preceding paragraphs we would like to make it clear that issue of a notice to the debtor by the creditor does not attract the application of principles of natural justice It is in fact a forum where proceedings are originally initiated in case of any grievance against the creditor in respect of any measure taken under sub section of Section of the Act It is also true that till the stage of making of the demand and notice under Section of the Act no hearing can be claimed for by the borrower But looking to the stringent nature of measures to be taken without intervention of court with a bar to approach the court or any other forum at that stage it becomes only reasonable that the secured creditor must bear in mind the say of the borrower before such a process of recovery is initiated So as to demonstrate that the reply of the borrower to the notice under Section of the Act has been considered applying mind to it The reasons howsoever brief that may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower True presumption is in favour of validity of an enactment and a legislation may not be declared unconstitutional lightly more so in the matters relating to fiscal and economic policies resorted to in the public interest but while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons aggrieved get a fair deal at the hands of those who have been vested with the powers to enforce drastic steps to make recovery The plea of absence of natural justice lies ill in the mouth of chronic defaulters who have not paid the principal amounts admittedly due to the banks We hope it was not meant to be said that all those who defaulted according to the banks and financial institutions must be condemned unheard who might not deserve any hearing to place their side of the case unless they must go through the crushing pre conditions of deposit of of the amount demanded over and above their secured assets already having been taken possession of We feel this can well be one example of hitting below the belt We feel the objections pointed out are not such which render the statute invalid or unconstitutional Such problems about working of any particular provision of the Act in any particular factual situation may be considered as and when it may arise Under the Act in consideration we find that before taking action a notice of days is required to be given and after the measures under Section of the Act have been taken a mechanism has been provided under Section of the Act to approach <ORG> The above noted provisions are for the purposes of giving some reasonable protection to the borrower Viewing the matter in the above perspective we find what emerges from different provisions of the Act is as follows After service of notice if the borrower raises any objection or places facts for consideration of the secured creditor such reply to the notice must be considered with due application of mind and the reasons for not accepting the objections howsoever brief they may be must be communicated to the borrower In connection with this conclusion we have already held a discussion in the earlier part of the judgment The reasons so communicated shall only be for the purposes of the information knowledge of the borrower without giving rise to any right to approach <ORG> under Section of the Act at that stage As already discussed earlier on measures having been taken under sub section of Section and before the date of sale auction of the property it would be open for the borrower to file an appeal petition under Section of the Act before <ORG> That the <ORG> in exercise of its ancillary powers shall have jurisdiction to pass any stay interim order subject to the condition at it may deem fit and proper to impose In view of the discussion already held on this behalf we find that the requirement of deposit of of amount claimed before entertaining an appeal petition under Section of the Act is an oppressive onerous and arbitrary condition against all the canons of reasonableness As discussed earlier in this judgment we find that it will be open to maintain a civil suit in civil court within the narrow scope and on the limited grounds on which they are permissible in the matters relating to an English mortgage enforceable without intervention of the court In view of the discussion held in the judgment and the findings and directions contained in the preceding paragraphs we hold that the borrowers would get a reasonably fair deal and opportunity to get the matter adjudicated upon before <ORG> The effect of some of the provisions may be a bit harsh for some of the borrowers but on that ground the impugned provisions of the Act cannot be said to be unconstitutional in view of the fact that the object of the Act is to achieve speedier recovery of the dues declared as NPAs and better availability of capital liquidity and resources to help in growth of economy of the country and welfare of the people in general which would subserve the public interest We therefore subject to what is provided in paragraph above uphold the validity of the Act and its provisions except that of sub section of Section of the Act which is declared ultra vires of Article of the Constitution of India
