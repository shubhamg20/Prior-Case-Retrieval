All these appeals involve common question of law based on same set of facts therefore we propose to decide these appeals by a common judgment The brief facts leading to the filing of the applications are briefly stated as under The Bombay Industrial Relations Act hereinafter referred to as the I Act governs the relationship between the employers and workmen in several industries operating in Gujarat and more particularly the Industry of Textile the Industry of Power in the late Bombay State area of Gujarat the Surat Industry the Banking Industry run by Banking Companies having no branches outside the State of Gujarat According to the respondents there are twelve Members of the <ORG> functioning in Gujarat State and so far as the <ORG> are concerned there are Judges functioning in Gujarat four of them are Judges who have completed more than ten years service as <ORG> Judges and several more <ORG> Judges are those who have completed more than five years service as <ORG> Judges and are therefore eligible for being appointed as Members of the <ORG> Opposing the applications it was submitted by the respondents appellants herein that no illegality was committed by recommending the name of <NAME> for appointment as the President of the <ORG> and that under Rules and of the Draft Recruitment Rules it has become necessary for the <ORG> on its administrative side to recommend the appointment of an appropriate person by nomination on the said post under Rule and that <NAME> whose name was recommended is fulfilling the criteria prescribed by the <ORG> as per the old Rules as well In the rejoinder affidavit it was submitted that neither the appointment order nor the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> shows that the appointment was made by the Governor of the State and that there is nothing to show that the Full Court was consulted by the appointing authority before making the appointment It was further stated that assuming that the appointment by nomination can be made on the post of a President of the <ORG> either under the old Rules pertaining to the post of President or under the new Rules which are at the draft stage only the candidate concerned should have atleast for ten years either held a judicial post in India or should have been an advocate for <ORG> or should have expert knowledge of Industrial matters <ORG> further held that there was no lawful justification for excluding the candidates who were holding the post of Member <ORG> and whereas they have been kept out of consideration on the basis of the proposed Draft Rules the consideration for making the appointment to the post in question stands vitiated Elaborating further <ORG> held In the first instance there is no question of appointment by nomination on the basis of the proposed Draft Rules by holding that existing Members were not eligible because they have not completed five years as Member We find that the procedure which has been adopted and which has led to the impugned appointment is not in conformity either with the general right of equality under Article of the Constitution of India and with the right of equality in matters relating to employment as contemplated by Article of the Constitution of India and therefore this appointment cannot be sustained in the eye of law It is also not in dispute that the respondent No had never been appointed as Member of <ORG> and in terms of Section of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act without being a Member of <ORG> there is no question of his appointment as the President of <ORG> either by promotion or by direct recruitment When the Act has not put any such fetter and the Act contemplates that one of the Members of the <ORG> shall be the President and it is not stated that he must complete certain years of service as Member through executive instructions such a requirement could not be pressed so as to defeat the right of consideration of the Members of the <ORG> for consideration of the post of the President Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the provisions of Section of the I Act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the President by promotion from amongst the Members the President can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired <ORG> Judges Per contra <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents apart from reiterating the contentions in the applications submitted that Section of the I Act clearly indicates that only Member of <ORG> is eligible for becoming the President of the <ORG> and that becoming Member of the <ORG> is sine qua non for being considered for the post of President of the <ORG> It was further contended that the appointment on a judicial post can be made only by His Excellency the Governor under Article of the Constitution of India and the State Government cannot issue Notification appointing Judicial Officer under the business rules by and in the name of His Excellency the Governor of the State He further submitted that even assuming the appointment to the post of President can be made through nomination or direct recruitment all the Members of the <ORG> were qualified for being appointed as President of the <ORG> by nomination in accordance with the Draft Rules that were relied upon by the Government supporting the appointment of <NAME> and that the Members of the <ORG> were eligible for appointment by nomination according to the Draft Rules also and that Rule ii of the Draft Rules provides inter alia that appointment to the post of President shall be made either a by promotion from amongst the Members of the <ORG> on the basis of seniority cum merit subject to the provision that for being considered as eligible for such promotion the Member concerned should have completed five years service as a Member of the <ORG> by nomination It was further contended that the appointment of Shri <NAME> straightaway by nomination without taking into consideration the cases of nomination of existing Members of <ORG> who had completed ten years functioning as a Judicial Officer has been rightly held by the <ORG> as violative of Articles and of the Constitution of India and that therefore no public appointment can be made in disregard of consideration of the cases of those who were qualified for the post It was further submitted that assuming that a District Judge can be directly appointed to the post of President <ORG> carrying a higher pay scale than that of the District Judges in Gujarat and assuming that even if somebody is already a Member of the Judiciary he can be nominated or directly appointed and that he did not pass through the channel of promotion or selection meant for those who are already in service in view of Article of the Constitution even in that case there was no justification for <ORG> on the administrative side to pick up <NAME> who was th in the list of seniority at the relevant time Concluding his arguments he submitted that <ORG> conclusion that Section of the I Act does not provide for nomination or direct recruitment and someone has to be appointed from amongst the Members of <ORG> only is correct and that there is no other provision in the entire I Act to provide for the mode of appointment of the President of <ORG> We have given our thoughtful consideration on the rival submissions made by the respective counsel appearing on either side Every member of <ORG> shall be a person who is not connected with the industrial dispute referred to such court or with any industry directly affected by such dispute Provided that no person shall be deemed to be connected with the industrial dispute or with the industry by reason only of the fact that he is a shareholder of an incorporated company which is connected with or likely to be affected by such industrial dispute but in such a case he shall disclose to <ORG> the nature and extent of the shares held by him in such company Every member of <ORG> shall be a person who is or has been a judge of <ORG> or is eligible for being appointed a judge of such Court Provided that a a person who has been a Judge not lower in rank than that of Assistant Judge for not less than three years or a person who has been the presiding officer of <ORG> constituted under any law for the time being in force for not less than five years or a person who holds a degree in law of a <ORG> established by law in any part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under <ORG> for not less than ten years shall also be eligible for appointment as a member of <ORG> In the background of the facts and circumstances and the provisions of law extracted above the following points arise for consideration by this Court a What is the true scope and interpretation of Section read with Section of the I Act Whether Section of the I Act can be read to mean that the President of <ORG> must be appointed from among the existing Members of <ORG> when the provision in fact is not in such terms Whether the reading of the provisions of Section of the I Act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the President by promotion from amongst the Members the President can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired <ORG> Judges or from the Judges of <ORG> Ahmedabad and District Judges who fulfills the eligibility requirement for appointment as Member of <ORG> Whether <ORG> has failed to appreciate that Section of the I Act does not envisage the mode of appointment Our attention was drawn to the relevant pleadings filed before <ORG> and also in this Court Under these circumstances it was decided to place the matter for consideration of <ORG> of <ORG> of Gujarat as to by which mode the post of the President <ORG> is to be filled up Considering the totality of the facts it is clear to us that there is neither illegality nor arbitrariness in taking the decision of recommending the name of Shri <NAME> for appointment on the post of President <ORG> Ahmedabad Based on the recommendation of <ORG> on its administrative side the <ORG> of Gujarat issued the Notification on whereby <NAME> had been appointed as the President of <ORG> The State Government therefore referred to <ORG> for consultation and approval of the Rules
