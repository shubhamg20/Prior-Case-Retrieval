HEADNOTE For the assessment year the assessable income of the appellant bank was computed by the Income tax Officer by splitting up its income into two heads interest on securities and business income and deducting the business loss from interest on securities The Income tax Officer rejected the claim on the ground that the loss was under the head business and so could not be set off against income from securities under of the Act On appeal to <ORG> it was contended for the appellant that ss and should be so read that where the securities in the hands of an assessee are trading assets would be excluded being restricted to capital investments only and the matter would fall under the head business within and in any case even if the income from securities fell under the appellant would be entitled to a set off under because it carried on only one business namely banking and the holding of securities by it was part of the said business Appeal from the judgment and order dated May of <ORG> in Income tax Reference No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal brought on a certificate of <ORG> raises a point of far reaching consequence as to the interpretation of ss and of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter termed the Act For the assessment year its assessable income was computed by the Income Tax Officer at Rs and under the head business income there was a loss of Rs In the previous year there was a loss of Rs Before the Income tax Officer the assessee made its claim on the basis that it was a part of the business of the <ORG> to deal in securities It also claimed that it carried on only one business namely banking as defined by of the Indian Companies Act in the course of which the <ORG> has to receive money on deposits and invest such deposits in securities loans and advances and therefore holdings of securities by it could not be treated as its separate business The Income tax Officer was of the opinion that as there was a loss under the head business its claim could not be sustained and hence it could not be set off under of the Act It therefore did not allow the loss of the previous year to be set off against the computed profits of the assessment year The learned Chief Justice during the course of his judgment said It appears to me therefore that because the several heads under in the Indian Act are mutually exclusive and because under any Income tax Law an item coming under an exclusive head cannot in any circumstances be charged under another head and also because the interest on securities in the hands of a banker cannot be treated as business income on the principles explained by Mr Justice <NAME> I must hold that the contention of the asesssee must be rejected Counsel for the appellant has raised three points That ss and of the Act should be so read that interest on securities in cases where the true nature and character of the securities in the hands of an assessee is one of trading assets would be excluded from the scope of and would fall under the head business within of the Act and alternatively even if ss and are read as specific heads then being more appropriate should be applied to the facts of the present case If ss and are equally applicable the assessee has the option to be taxed under that head which imposes a lighter burden on him and Lastly he contended that even if the heads of income were to be taken as mutually exclusive so that the interest on securities falls under and business under of the Act the assessee would be entitled to a set off under because interest on securities and profits and gains from business result from different operations of the same business the two being different forms of the same business of the assessee Section defines total income to mean total amount of income profits and gains computed in the manner laid down in the Act Section provides that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Act Section provides that the total income of any previous year of any person includes all income profits and gains from whatever sources derived It is further contended that if the object of the legislature was to give a separate and exclusive identity to the income from interest on securities it would have made the language of of the Act as specific as it has made in the case of income from dividends from shares which income by the addition of sub I A to has come to have a specific place under the head other sources and is no longer within the head business under of the Act and thus by statute its nature and character have undergone a change It is also contended by counsel for the I A Revenue that even if there is any overlapping between ss and interest on securities whether accruing from securities held as a capital asset or trading assets falls under alone and should be so read as to altogether exclude the income from interest on securities The heads there shown are Salary Interest on securities Property Business profession or vocation other sources and income from each source is to be shown in a separate column in each one of which reference is made to a particular note relevant to that head of income Interest payable on money borrowed for the purpose of investment in the securities except certain interest payable to persons abroad from which tax has not been deducted see section of the Act for details So every item of income whatever its source would fall under one particular head and for the purpose of computing the income for charging of income tax the particular section dealing with that head will have to be looked at Thus this proviso now provides that reasonable amount can be deducted by an assessee for commission paid to a <ORG> or remuneration paid to anybody else for realising interest on its behalf which clearly indicates the intention of the legislature that interest on securities specifically falls under and under no other section Section requires a person responsible for paying interest on securities to deduct income tax on the amount of the interest payable at the maximum rate and the person so responsible is required after deduction of the income tax to pay to the account of the Central Government within days of the deduction the sum so deducted and under the maximum rate is to be charged for the year in which the the amount is paid and not at the rate of the assessment year As has been pointed out in that judgment there are no separate taxes under the various schedules but only one tax This supports the contention of each head being separate exclusive and specific Decided cases all support the contention of counsel for the <ORG> that the various heads of income enumerated in of the Act and more particularly I dealt with in ss to are exclusive heads and if an item of income falls under one of these heads then it has to be treated for the purpose of income tax under that head and no other In this building there were rooms which were let to tenants Thus even though the assessee was a company carrying on business or trade income from the head property was taxed under Sch This case supports the contention that different Schedules being distinctly applicable to each individual head of income would exclude the applicability of any other head In <NAME> <ORG> a British company controlled in Egypt was carrying on business of lending money on mortgage of land in Egypt or on the security of debentures by mortgage of land <NAME> said A banker could never ask to be repaid the tax which had been deducted from the Government securities which he held because he held them as a banker the point being that when you have once got a security we will say the interest on which is taxed by the Act you cannot get out of it because you say that you look a little further and see this is only embedded in a business there should be included as receipts the amounts realised by the sale of bonds ex coupons and the net proceeds of the coupons and as disbursements the amounts paid by the company for the bonds cum coupons incorporated for the purpose of owning such property therefore the income derived from property must be regarded as income derived from business In my judgment income derived from property is a more specific category applicable to the present case The business of the assessees showed a loss but the assessees claimed earned income relief in respect of interest on securities on the ground that securities which they had purchased and sold as part of their business formed their stock in trade and the interest therefrom should be treated as business profits that if income falls under more than one head the assessee has the option to choose the head which makes the burden on his shoulders lighter It was held that the company was carrying on the business of letting a rice mill and as such was entitled to a deduction for depreciation The judgment of <NAME> shows that it was clear from the facts of the case that the company was carrying on business I Consequently Lord <NAME> observation in <ORG> It appears to me that this selection is not only justified in law but is founded upon the soundest and most elementary principles of business In its application to the <ORG> for stating the case to <ORG> the assessee specifically raised in two suggested questions its right to set off the business loss of Rs The appellant seems to have rested his case on the applicability of to the profits under the head interest on securities because of the securities being trading assets but this contention was repelled and the same question has been raised before us but the assessee now supports his case on an alternative argument that even if the securities fall under still the profits from that source are from an item of the assessee business and therefore the loss of the previous year from the banking business of the assessee can be set off against the profits of the assessment year whatever be the source of that profit In view of the order we propose to make we do not find it necessary to express any opinion on the respective contentions raised by counsel for the parties The appeal would therefore be allowed and the case remitted to <ORG> for a fresh decision of the reference after getting from the <ORG> a fuller statement of facts about this part of the case whether the securities in question were a part of the trading assets held by the assessee in the course of its business as a banker
