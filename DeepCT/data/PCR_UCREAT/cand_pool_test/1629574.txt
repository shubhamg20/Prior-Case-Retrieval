The respondent filed an application for winding up <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the company More than two months after the filing of the appeal a reference was made by the company under Section of the Sick Industrial Companies Special Provisions Act to <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> constituted under the Act These facts were brought on record by way of a supplementary affidavit filed by the company According to Mr <NAME> after the registration of a reference under Section the <ORG> has no option but to hold an enquiry under Section of the Act It is argued by way of analogy that a suit is said to be pending when it is filed and not only when the court takes up the suit for hearing In support of this proposition reliance has been placed on a passage from <NAME> on the Interpretation of Statutes twelfth edition page which reads as follows If the choice is between two interpretations the narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation we should avoid a construction which would reduce the legislation to futility and should rather accept the bolder construction based on the view that <ORG> would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result iii It is also contended by Mr <NAME> that in the event there was any doubt regarding the construction to be put on Sections and of the Act the doubt should be resolved in favour of the company on the principle that the Act is a beneficial piece of legislation Reliance was also placed on the decision of Pilcher in Estate of Rippon All ER It was argued on behalf of the respondent that the registration of the reference by the secretary under regulation is a mere ministerial act ii Mr <NAME> further contended that the language of Section would make it clear that there is a discretion which is vested in the <ORG> either to make or not to make an enquiry It is further argued that as soon as an enquiry is commenced by the <ORG> it is a mandatory requirement that the <ORG> should appoint one or more persons to be a special director or special directors of the company for safeguarding the financial and other interests of the company It is contended that the principle of beneficial construction of a statute can apply only if there is ambiguity in the wording of the Section to be construed It is stated that Sections and are not ambiguous and that there is no scope for applying the principle of beneficial construction Although this issue was not specifically raised before <ORG> in the Gram Panchayat case we cannot lose sight of the observations of <ORG> in paragraph of the decision viz where an appeal under Section relating to an industrial company is pending then no proceedings for the winding up of the industrial company shall be proceeded with further except with the consent of the Board or as the case may be the appellate authority Apart from the heading of Chapter III of the Act the regulations would also show that a distinction is drawn between a reference and an enquiry Had it been the intention of the <ORG> to extend the provisions of Section to a reference made under Section the <ORG> would have provided for that expressly It is well established that if the language is clear the court must give effect to it for the words of the statute speak the intention of the <ORG> In these circumstances the case of In re Eippon All ER as well as the two passages from <NAME> cited by Mr <NAME> can have no application In view of the express wording of the statute there is no question of the application of the principles of beneficial construction Furthermore it will appear from Section that proceedings may be continued against the industrial company with the consent of the <ORG> This would suggest that the <ORG> would have to apply its mind for the purpose of determining whether the consent should be granted or not The final contention of Mr <NAME> namely that because an appeal may lie from the decision of the <ORG> not to hold an enquiry therefore the phrase pending enquiry under Section in Section of the Act must include references registered under Section is in our view a non sequitur Suffice it to say that in view of the clear wording of Section there is no need to embark upon an enquiry into the intention of <ORG> In that view of the matter we dismiss this application and vacate all interim orders
