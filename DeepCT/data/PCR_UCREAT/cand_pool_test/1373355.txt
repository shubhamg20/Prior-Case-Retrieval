It is contended that the words of the rule prevent us from directing the discharge of the accused in case we set aside the conviction There would be no doubt that if the words if necessary came after the word and we could set aside the conviction and discharge the accused Giving a reasonable construction to the words of the rule we do not think that the learned Judges who granted the rule ever intended to say that the <ORG> hearing the rule should have no power to discharge the accused person The learned Magistrate after saying that the question is purely one of possession and that the Assistant Magistrate came to the conclusion that the prosecution had proved their possession goes on to say I am not quite sure whether I should have arrived at the same conclusion but nothing has been urged before me which justifies me in upsetting the finding on the question of fact Having regard to the view that we take if the Judge of the Appellate <ORG> had any doubt that the conviction was a right one and had any doubt as to whether the offence charged had been committed whatever the original <ORG> did he should have discharged the accused There is evidence of possession apparently which has been accepted by one <ORG> We set aside the conviction and direct the discharge of the accused
