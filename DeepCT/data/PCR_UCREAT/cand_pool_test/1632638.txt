This appeal with certificate is directed against a judgment dated July of <ORG> of <ORG> by which the appellant appeal from a judgment of a Single Judge of that High Court had been dismissed The appellant is also the sole selling agent of a German firm called <ORG> The appellant filed his Bill of Entry before the <ORG> authorities on January By a memorandum dated December the appellant was asked to show cause why penal action should not be taken against the appellant under Section Clause of the Sea <ORG> Act read with Section of the Imports and Exports Control Act Under the same memorandum the appellant was also asked to show cause why penal action should not be taken against him under Section of the Sea <ORG> Act for taking out certain goods without making a due entry for them The appellant in due course showed cause against the said notice and asked for a personal hearing The import licence that was granted to the appellant described the things covered by the licence as spare parts in power driven agricultural machinery parts of sprayers According to the <ORG> authorities though the appellant import licence was one in respect of goods covered by Item vi he had in fact brought goods falling under Item so that in effect the goods that the appellant had imported were not covered by any valid import licence Finally on or about May one <NAME> who incidentally was not the Collector who heard the appellant passed an order by which he held that the appellant firm had deliberately cleared <ORG> battery sprayers in an unauthorised manner that is to say without a valid licence to cover their imports <NAME> also found that the appellant had taken out certain goods valued at Rupees without proper declaration or without filing an appropriate Bill of Entry and also without production of a valid licence Thereupon instead of following the usual remedies under the Sea <ORG> Act the appellant filed a petition under Article of the Constitution before <ORG> The present appeal is directed against the order of <ORG> There is very little controversy between the parties regarding the facts of this case Mr <NAME> who appeared for the appellant before us admitted frankly that unless the Collector decision is found to be perverse neither the High <ORG> nor this <ORG> could interfere with that decision The only question that arises in these circumstances can in our opinion be framed in the following manner Mr <NAME> argued that if we have any doubts in our minds as to the answer to this question in other words if two alternative interpretations are possible of the exact scope and effect of the description of the items in the I Schedule we should favour that interpretation which would be beneficial to the subject Appeal No of <ORG> where it was held Assuming that there is a doubt in the construction of the licence the appellant against whom the penal provisions of Section of the Sea Customs Act are sought to be enforced is entitled to the benefit of the doubt Mr <NAME> appearing for the respondents however drew our attention to decisions of two larger Benches of this <ORG> according to which if the view taken by the <ORG> authorities as to the scope and applicability of the different I Schedules be a reasonable view there should be no interference with the decision of the <ORG> authorities <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> found that the decision of the Assistant Collector of <ORG> and of the Collector of <ORG> on appeal holding the oats in question to be grains could not be characterised as perverse or mala fide In our opinion there is nothing in the decision of the Collector which can warrant its condemnation as perverse or unreasonable Even if it be assumed that because of the language used in the two items viz Items vi and of the I Schedule there is some room for confusion it would not be competent for <ORG> to interfere in a writ petition with the conclusion or finding of the Collector of <ORG> regarding the scope and ambit of those items We dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of <ORG> In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case however we make no order as to costs
