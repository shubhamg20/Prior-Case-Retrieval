Natural Justice Civil Service Promotion Selection on Merit alone Eligible officers considered on merit in an objective manner Seniors not selected Seniority Whether confers any legal right on a

statutory provisions nature of the right affected and the consequences which may entail According to Rule recruitment to <ORG> is made by i direct recruitment through competitive examination ii promotion of substantive members of <ORG> Execu tive and iii selection from amongst persons holding posts in substantive capacity in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> who may not be members of

found suitable for the inclusion of the names in the Select List the seniors stand superseded as the selection is made on merit and not on the basis of seniority In similar Writ Petitions the Full Bench of <ORG> to whom the matter was referred for consideration on the question as to whether the Select List of was vitiated for non compliance of Regulation iii inasmuch as reasons for supersession of senior officers were not for warded to the <ORG> held that the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case SCR did not affect the position and <ORG> decision in <NAME> case supra correctly laid down the law In the present appeals and petitions on behalf of the appellants and petitioners it was contended that the Select Lists of and were vitiated as the Selection <ORG> did not record any reasons in super seding the appellants petitioners while excluding their names and including the names of junior officers in the Select Lists that the amendment of the Regulation was violative of Articles and as it conferred unguided power on the Selection <ORG> to supersede senior offi cers that the Select List prepared for the year was vitiated for non compliance of Regulation iii as reasons recorded by <ORG> were not forward ed by <ORG> to the <ORG> along with record of officers proposed to be superseded that even if under the Regulations no reasons were necessary to be recorded principles of Natural Justice and fair play re quired Puri as a Member of the Selection <ORG> that the Regulation and of the Promotion Regulations were violative of Rule of the Recruitment Rules inasmuch as the Promotion Regulations impinge upon the <ORG> Govern ment power to make recommendations for appointment to the service that <ORG> deliberately delayed its comments on the Select List prepared for to the <ORG> with a view to give undue advan tage to the officers included in the list for promotion to <ORG> Having regard to the legislative history and the purpose and the object which was sought to be achieved by the amend ments there could be no mandatory legal obligation on the <ORG> to record reasons Per <NAME> Regulation of <ORG> Appointment by Promotion Regulations provided that if in the process of selection review or revision it is proposed to supersede any member of <ORG> the Selection committee shall record its reasons for the proposed supersession The amended provisions of Regulation have cur tailed and restricted the role of seniority in the process of selection as it has given primacy to merit Now the <ORG> is required to categorise the eligible officers in four different A Where promotion is made on the basis of seniority the senior has preferential right to promotion against his juniors but where promotion is made on merit alone senior officer has no legal right to promotion and if juniors to him are selected for promotion on merit the senior officer is not legally superseded I Article ensures equality in matters relating to appointment and promotion to an office or post under the <ORG> It enjoins <ORG> not to practise discrimination in matters relating to appointment and promotion A member of the <ORG> Civil ServiCe eligible for selection for promotion to the I A has right to be considered alongwith others for selection for promotion If eligible officers are con sidered on merit in an objective manner no Government servant has any legal right to insist for promotion nor any such right is protected by Article or of the Constitu tion A In the absence of a statutory provision <ORG> is under no legal obligation to record reasons in support of its decision There is no scope for applying principles of natural justice in matters relating to selection of suitable members of <ORG> Service for promo tion to a higher service These principles do not apply to all cases and situations If during the process of selection a senior officer is proposed to be superseded by virtue of not being included in the Select List and if opportunity is afforded to him to make repre sentation and only thereafter the List is finalised the process would be cumbersome and time consuming There fore no opportunity is necessary to be afforded to him for making representation against the proposed supersession There are therefore adequate checks and safeguards at different stages by different authorities Where power is vested in high authority there is a presumption that the same would be exercised reasonably However if the selection is made on extraneous considera tions in arbitrary manner the <ORG> have ample power to strike down the same and that is an adequate safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power There are various methods of selection viz There is hardly any scope for applying different standards or criteria at different times as the service records namely the character roll entries would indicate the category of the officers as adjudged by the authority recording annual confidential remarks Therefore there is no merit in the submission that Regulations and are dis criminatory and they violate Articles and of the Constitution The material placed on record leaves no doubt that <NAME> designated as Financial <ORG>er Devel opment was also discharging the duties and functions of the Development <ORG>er He was therefore holding the dual charge as no separate post of Development <ORG>er had been sanctioned by the Government As Financial <ORG>er Development he was exercising same powers and discharging same functions which could he performed by a Development <ORG>er therefore he was competent to participate in the delibera tions of the Selection <ORG> There is further no allegations of mala fide or bias against <NAME> There is evidence on record to show that recommendations of the Selection <ORG> constituted under Regulation were unanimous which were scrutinised by <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG> before the same were approved A In the instant case the validity of the recom mendations made or the preparation of select List of are not vitiated as <NAME> was neither biased against any of the appellant peti tioners nor there was any conflict between his personal interest and duty <NAME> had no interest in the inclusion or exclusion of any member of <ORG> nor he had any personal interest in preparing the List There is no allegation of bias or malice against <NAME> The Central Government has framed promotion Regula tions which provide method and manner of selection The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the judgment in draft to be delivered by my learned brother <NAME> I agree with him that the appeals and the writ petitions herein should be dismissed without any order as to costs I also respectfully agree with him on the conclusions he has reached on the different contentions urged before us in these cases It is not necessary to refer to the facts and the issues which have been exhaustively discussed by my learned brother There is however one aspect of the matter on which I have certain reservations and I would like to express my views on this aspect so that the Government and the authorities concerned may try to evolve a little more objective basis on that aspect This Court reiterated in the context of the said Regulation that there was a mandatory obligation to record reasons in superseding senior officers and therefore in the absence of such reasons <ORG> had been vitiated It is stated on behalf of the respondents that it was felt difficult to record reasons in the prescribed manner as laid down by this Court in the said decision and the ques tion was considered by <ORG> in May and was further considered It is also true that if selection is made on merit alone for promotion to higher service selection of such an officer though junior in service in preference to his senior does not really amount to supersession If promotion is made on merit alone the senior officer per se has no legal right to promotion and if promotion is made on merit it cannot be said that a senior officer has been superseded Objectivity in subjective evaluation of the worth of the different officers would go a long way to generate a feeling that justice has been done and unless members of the administration feel that justice has been done to them the administration cannot become an effective weapon for social change ushering social justice I however hasten to add that in these cases I agree with my learned brother that justice has been done in ac cordance with the rules to the officers concerned and there fore concur with him in the order as proposed <NAME> These three Civil Appeals are directed against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> dismissing the writ petitions filed by <NAME> Mrs <NAME> challenging the validity of the Select List pre pared for the year for promotion of members of <ORG> Executive to the Indian Admin istrative Service During the pendency of these appeals writ petitions were filed before this Court under Article of the Constitution by <NAME> <NAME> and other members of the <ORG> Executive challenging the validity of Select List prepared for the year and He filed another writ petition challenging the validity of that Select List also almost on the same grounds that writ petition was also dismissed by <ORG> on November The petitioners further challenged the vires of the Regulations on the ground of their being inconsistent with the Indian Administrative Service Recruitment Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules and inclusion of name of <NAME> was assailed on the ground that he had earned adverse re marks and yet he was selected <ORG> by a well considered judgment rendered in <NAME> case supra dismissed all the three writ petitions on the find ings that the select list prepared for the year was in accordance with the regulations and it did not suffer from any legal infirmity It appears that validity of the Select List of was challenged by <NAME> and other offi cers of the state civil service before <ORG> under Article of the Constitution on the same ground which had already been rejected by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra The Full Bench of <ORG> held that the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case did not affect the position and <ORG> decision in <NAME> case correctly laid down the law Amendment of the Regulation is viola tive of Articles and as it confers unguided power on <ORG> to supersede senior officers The select list prepared for the year was vitiated for the non compliance of Regula tion iii as no reasons were forwarded by <ORG> to the <ORG> along with record of officers proposed to be super seded The select list prepared for the year was vitiated on account of the unauthorised participation of <NAME> as a member of <ORG> <ORG> deliberately delayed its comments on the select list prepared for to <ORG> with a view to give undue advantage to the officers included in the list for promotion to <ORG> Before we consider the submissions made on behalf of the appellants petitioners we think it necessary to refer to the relevant statutory provisions regulating promotion of mem bers of <ORG> to <ORG> Rule provides for recruitment to the service according to this rule recruit ment to <ORG> is made by i direct recruitment through competitive examination ii promotion of substantive members of <ORG> Executive and iii Selection from amongst persons holding posts in substantial capacity in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> who may not be members of <ORG> Rule provides for direct recruitment through competitive examination Regulation provides for constitution of a <ORG> consisting of the Chairman of <ORG> or a member of the <ORG> and other members as specified in column to the schedule to the Regulations In the process of preparing the select list if the seniors are not found suitable for promotion and their names in the select list is not included and if junior officers are found suitable for the inclusion of their names in <ORG> the seniors stand superseded as the selection is made on merit and not on the overall relative assessment of their service record In the process of preparing the select list if the seniors are not found suitable for promo tion and their names in the select list is not included and if junior officers are found suitable for the inclusion of their names in <ORG> the seniors stand supersed ed as the selection is made on merit and not on the basis of seniority Learned counsel for the appellants petitioners assailed the validity of <ORG> of and on the ground that the <ORG> did not record any reasons in superseding the appellants and petitioners The Court further held that the Selection <ORG> was under a mandatory obligation to record reasons in super seding senior officers in the absence of any such reasons <ORG> was vitiated The number of members of <ORG> included in the list shall not be more than twice the number of substantive vacancies anticipated in the course of the period twelve months commencing from the date of the preparation of the list The Selection for inclusion in such list shall be based on merit and suitability in all respects with due regard to seniority The names of the officers included in the list shall be arranged in order of seniority in <ORG> If in the process of selection review or revision it is proposed to supersede any member of <ORG> the <ORG> shall record its reasons for the proposed supersession Under the amended Regulations the <ORG> is required to categorise officers in four categories on the basis of overall assessment of service record of officers In <NAME> case the Regulation as it then existed laid down that selection for inclusion in the list shall be based on merit and suitability with due regard to seniority which meant that merit and suitability in all respects was the governing consideration and seniority was to play a secondary role but if merit and suitability were roughly equal seniority was the determining factor or if it was not reasonably possible to assess inter se merit and suitability of two eligible officers and come to a firm conclusion seniority tilted the scale Regulation as it then existed laid emphasis on the role of seniority as it laid down that in the process of selection review or revision of the select list if it was proposed to supersede any member of <ORG> the <ORG> shall record its reasons for the proposed supersession This <ORG> in <NAME> case held that if senior officer was superseded by including the name of a Junior Officer in the select list in preference to a senior officer the <ORG> was under a mandatory legal obligation to record reasons in a manner which would disclose how the record of each officer superseded stood in relation to record of others who were to be preferred The court further emphasised that recording of reasons was necessary as it provided a visible safeguard against possible injustice and arbitrariness in making the selection The Commit tee noted that consequent to the judgment of this <ORG> in <NAME> case there was tendency for the Selection Commit tee to go by seniority subject to the rejection of the unfit even though Regulations prescribed merit as the criteria for selection The amended provisions of Regulation have curtailed and restricted the role of seniority in the process of selection as it has given primacy to merit If there are five officers fail within the Out standing category their names shall be arranged in the order having regard to their inter se seniority in <ORG> Where selection made on merit alone for promotion to a higher service selection of an officer though junior in service in preference to his senior does not strictly amount to supersession Where promotion is made on the basis of seniority the senior has preferential fight to promotion against his juniors but where promotion is made on merit alone senior officer has no legal right to promotion and if juniors to him are selected for promotion on merit the senior officer is not legally superseded This court held that a member of <ORG> has no legal right to promotion instead he has only right to be considered along with others BUt assuming that appellants petitioners stood superseded by the reason that junior officers to them were included in the select list no reasons were necessary to be recorded in view of the amended statutory provisions We find no merit in the submission Article ensures equality in matters relating to appointment and promotion to an officer or post under the <ORG> A member of the <ORG> Civil Service eligible for selection for promotion to the <ORG> has right to be con sidered alongwith others for selection for promotion servant has any legal right to insist for promotion nor any such right is protected by the Article or of the Constitution We find no merit in the submission Principles of natu ral justice do not require an administrative authority or a selection committee or an examiner to record reasons for the selection or non selection of a person In the absence of a statutory provision an administrative authority is under no legal obligation to record reasons in support of its deci sion There is no scope for applying principles of natural justice in matters relating to selection of suitable members of <ORG> for promotion to a higher service Both the learned Judges who constituted the Bench repelled the contention SCR a Constitution Bench of this <ORG> held these rules operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made In other words they do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it If that is their purpose there is no reason why they should not be made applicable to adminis trative proceedings also especially when it is not easy to draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries from quasi judicial ones and an unjust decision in an adminis trative enquiry may have a more far reaching effect than a decision in a quasi judicial enquiry What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circum stances of that case the flame work of the law under which the enquiry is held and the Constitution of the Tribunal or the body of persons appointed for that purpose SCR this <ORG> held that if a statutory provision either specifically or by necessary implication excludes the appli cation of any or all the principles of natural justice then the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory authority and read into the concerned provi sions the principles of natural justice Whether the exer cise of a power conferred should be made in accordance with any of the principles of natural justice or not depends upon the express words of the provision conferring power the nature of the power conferred the purpose for which it is conferred and the effect of the exercise of that power These principles do not apply to all cases and situations SCC a Constitution Bench of this Court considered the scope and extent of applicability of principles of natural justice to administrative actions This right can also be excluded where the nature of the action to be taken its object and purpose and the scheme of the relevant statutory provisions warrant its exclusion nor can the audi alteram partem rule be in voked if importing it would have the effect of paralysing the administrative process or where the need for promptitude or the urgency of taking action so demands as pointed out in <NAME> SCR cases If during the process of selection a senior officer is proposed to be superseded by virtue of not being included in the select list and if opportunity is afforded to him to make representation and only thereafter the list is finalised the process would be cumbersome and time consuming It was urged that even after deletion of Regulation which required <ORG> to record reasons for supersession of an officer by the Notification dated June Regulation iii remained unamended therefore the <ORG> was under a mandatory duty to record reasons and the State <ORG> Since the <ORG> failed to comply with the mandatory obligation the select list prepared for the year stood vitiated alongwith a the records of all officers of <ORG> included in the list the records of all other eligible officers of <ORG> who are not adjudged suitable for inclusion in the list together with the reasons as recorded by the <ORG> for their non inclusion in the list The Court held that Regulation which provided for recording reasons was mandatory and it must be complied with But in view of the amendments made in Regulations under consideration providing for selection on the basis of categorisation of members of <ORG> into different categories on the assessment of their service records principles laid down in <NAME> case are not applicable After the amendment of Regulation the <ORG> was under no legal obligation to record reasons for supersession of a senior officer and for that reason it did not record any reasons therefore the question of forwarding any reasons by <ORG> to the Com mission did not arise Regulation iii which required <ORG> to forward to the <ORG> along with reasons as recorded by the <ORG> for the proposed super session of any member of <ORG> was con sistent with the unamended Regulation which required the <ORG> to record reasons for supersession of a member of <ORG> Having regard to the legislative history and the purpose and the object which was sought to be achieved by the amendments there could be no mandatory legal obligation on the Commit tee to record reasons Since the entire system of selection has been changed on account of amendment in the regulations the principles laid down in <NAME> case do not apply to the instant cases case have taken similar views There are therefore adequate checks and safeguards at different stages by different authorities But if any dispute arise with regard to the arbitrary exclusion of a senior member of the <ORG> Service the matter can always be investigated by perusing his service records and comparing the same with the service record of officers who may have been preferred and that would certainly disclose the reasons for the supersession of the senior officer There is no reason to hold that they would not act in fair and impartial manner in making selection and if it finds any discrimination in the selec tion it has power to refer the matter to the <ORG> with its recommendations In this view we find no good reasons to hold that in the absence of reasons the selection would be made arbitrarily Where power is vested in high authority there is a presumption that the same would be exercised in a reasonable manner and if the selection is made on extraneous considerations in arbitrary manner the courts have ample power to strike down the same and that is an adequate safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power It was urged that the selection merely based on the appraisal of service record is arbitrary and it is bound to cause injustice as entries in the character roll of members of <ORG> depend upon the whims of the recording officer There are various methods of selection viz If there is an adverse entry against any officer that officer is given an opportunity to ex plain There is hardly any scope for applying different standards or criteria at different times as the service records namely the character roll entries would indicate the category of the officers as adjudged by the authority recording annual confidential remarks There is no scope for applying different standard or test in preparing the list or to practice discrimination We therefore find no merit in the submission that Regulation and are discrim inatory and they violate Article and of the Constitu tion In the affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Punjab it has been asserted that <ORG> was under the charge of the Financial Commissioner who was designated as Financial Commissioner <ORG> and <NAME> who was holding the rank of the Commissioner was the Secretary Incharge of <ORG> In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State <ORG> He was neither holding the rank of Commissioner nor he was the Secretary Incharge of <ORG> The material placed on record leaves no room for any doubt that <NAME> designated as Financial Commissioner Devel opment was also discharging the duties and functions of the <ORG> Commissioner He was therefore holding the dual charge as no separate post of <ORG> Commissioner had been sanctioned by the <ORG> As Financial Commissioner <ORG> he was exercising same powers and discharging same functions which could be performed by a <ORG> Commissioner therefore he was competent to participate in the deliberations of the selection committee There is further no allegations of mala fide or bias against <NAME> There is evidence on record to show that recommendations of <ORG> consti tuted under Regulation were unanimous which were scruti nised by the State <ORG> The Court held that the participation of the Acting Chief Con servator vitiated the recommendations made by <ORG> as there was conflict between the Acting Chief Con servator personal interest and his duty and further he was a Judge in his own cause The Court further held that taking into consideration probability and ordinary course of human conduct there was reasonable ground for believing that the Acting Chief Conservator was likely to have been biased Principles laid down in <NAME> case do not effect the validity of the recommendations made for the preparation of select list of as <NAME> was neither biased against any of the appellants petitioners nor there was conflict between his personal interest and duty <NAME> had no interest in the inclusion or exclusion of a member of <ORG> nor he had any personal interest in preparing the list There is no allegation of bias or malice against <NAME> his participation in the meeting of <ORG> did not render the select list of illegal has framed promotion regula tions which provide method and manner of selection in the order in which their names appear in the select list There is therefore no merit in the petitioners submis sion On behalf of <NAME> Petitioner it was urged that <ORG> acted mala fide in deliberately delay ing its comments to the <ORG> on the list of and thereby it manipulated appointment of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> allega tions regarding mala fide have been denied No material has been placed before us to substantiate the plea of mala fide The records of all the eligible officers are scrutinized by the <ORG> <ORG> and the <ORG> before the Select List is finally approved and if there is any difference between the authorities consultation between <ORG> As the select list is to be prepared each year <ORG> should take action well in advance to avoid any delay There is no dispute that the aforesaid officers were promoted and appointed to <ORG> before the approval of the select list for the year We therefore find no merit in the appeals and the writ petitions
