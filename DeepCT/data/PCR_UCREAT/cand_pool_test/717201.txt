Exh Among the injuries found on the dead body of Mrs <NAME> there were injuries on her private parts which were opined to be due to violent sexual attack by more than one person on her He took over the case from <ORG> and continued investigation He sent the message about the theft of the car and kept PSI <NAME> <ORG> on watch duty that the police had taken charge of the Rooman bungalow and sealed it He gave some trousers to <NAME> PW for alteration for the purpose of reducing the length and on the next day he gave Table clock Article of <ORG> to <NAME> PW The tape was containing the superficial layer of the skin which explains the injury Nos and in the post mortem report Exh Admittedly there are no eye witnesses of the occurrence The trial court enumerated them and after due consideration held that they formed a complete chain so as to bring home the guilt of the accused without giving room to any other hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused Accordingly the trial court found the appellants guilty and convicted then of offences punishable under Section read Section and sentenced them to death subject to confirmation by <ORG> Section read with section sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rupees two hundred and in default suffer one month rigorous imprisonment Section read with Section sentenced them to

seven years and to pay a fine of Rupees two hundred and in default suffer one month rigorous imprisonment Section IPC sentenced them to ten years rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rupees two hundred and i default one month rigorous imprisonment Section read with Section sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rupees five hundred and in default one month rigorous imprisonment Section read with Section sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rupees two hundred in default one month rigorous imprisonment As already noted above <ORG> heard the reference with regard to confirmation of the sentence of death awarded to the appellants along with the appeals filed by them and after considering the entire evidence exhaustively confirmed the judgment of the trial court except in respect of charge under Section In these appeals various contentions were urged by <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing for Appellants Nos and and Smt He was produced before the court on th August and magisterial custody was obtained for identification parade So far as identification by these witnesses at the time of trial without their participation in the TIP is concerned it was argued that their identification was worthless and therefore that part of the evidence should be excluded from consideration and thus a vital link in the chain of circumstances would be missing so their conviction based on such identification had to be set aside <NAME> the learned senior counsel for the State of Maharashtra contended that the test identification of an accused by a witness was for the purposes of ensuring that the prosecution was on the right track and to ensure that the memory of the witness did not fail on account of lapse of time from his first seeing the accused and this criteria would not apply to a witness who has known the accused earlier so their identification for the first time at the time of trial would not demolish the case of the prosecution It falls in the realm of investigation But if a witness has known an accused earlier in such circumstances which lend assurance to identification by him in court and if there is no inherent improbability or inconsistency there is no reason why his statement in court about the identification of accused should not be relied upon as any other acceptable but uncorroborated testimony About the identification of the accused in court it was indicated that the same did not provide safe and trustworthy evidence to sustain conviction The identification proceedings therefore must be so conducted that evidence with regard to them when given at the trial enables the court safely to form appropriate judicial opinion about its evidentiary value for the purpose of corroborating of contradicting the statement in court of the identifying witness Apart from the evidence of conspiracy there was evidence of PW who identified the appellants therein running away near the scene of occurrence after the raid took place in the police station Firstly his presence in the travelling bungalow was doubted and secondly it was pointed out that he identified the appellants therein a persons who were running away near the place of occurrence and that the witness had admitted that he knew those two persons by face yet he named them while identifying them in court it was observed that there was huge crowd after the police station was attacked and if those two appellants wee seen running away that by itself should not show that they had taken part in the raid We have already laid down above that the identification of the accused by a witness if he had an opportunity to interact with him or to notice his distinctive features lends assurance to his testimony in court and that the absence of corroborative evidence by way of test identification parade would not be material From the above mentioned aspect the evidence of PW and PW has been rightly rejected by the trial court and <ORG> as PW is a rickshaw driver who had no opportunity to see closely the appellants whom he took to Rooman bungalow in the night So also PW identification of A in court without his participation in the TIP has also no probative value inasmuch as he went to the shop of the witness as one of the customers and there was no specific reason why he should watch A closely it can safely be presumed that had they not given the name and description of the appellants at the earliest when their statement was recorded by the police on th July the defence in their searching and lengthy cross examination would have brought on record omissions and contradictions with reference to their earlier statement given to the police It may be noted that the evidence of the witness of search was accepted notwithstanding the fact that he was not of the locality where the search took place and notwithstanding the fact he was brought by the police along with them for the purposes of search The evidence however can be rejected if it suffers from any serious infirmities or if there is any inherent inconsistency in the testimony It there is intrinsic merit in the evidence of the witness of search the same cannot be rejected solely on the ground that witness is not from the locality of search or that he was brought by the police with it Sub section of Section provides that whenever there is a reason to believe that by requiring an officer in charge of another police station section to cause a search to be made under sub section of that section might occasion delay and result in evidence of the commission of an offence being concealed or destroyed it shall be lawful for the investigating officer of team making investigation under Chapter XII to search or cause to search any place in the limits of another police section in accordance with the provisions of Section However what is pointed out before us is that the copies of the letters sent to the other police station in whose jurisdiction the search and seizures were made had not been produced We find no substance in this submission There is thus no non compliance the aforementioned provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure In <NAME> vs State of Madhya Pradesh the appellant gained access to the house of the deceased who was childless on the pretext that by sorcery he would remove the evil effect which would enable him to beget children He then went to the house of the deceased and killed his mother <NAME> and his nephew Mr <NAME> while they were sleeping there
