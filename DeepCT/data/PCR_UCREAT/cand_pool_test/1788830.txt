In all these matters different notifications under Section of the Act were issued as it appeared to <ORG> that lands specified in these notifications which were under challenge in these matters were likely to be needed for the purpose of a housing colony of <ORG> which was engaged in <ORG> which was for a public purpose All the lands are situated in village Mandalla Taluk Choryasi District Surat In SCA acquisition was set aside on the ground that there was no compliance with the provisions of Rules and of the Land Acquisition Companies Rules Rules for short In SCA acquisition was set aside not only on the ground of non compliance with the Rules and of the Rules but also that petitioners therein were not served with notice under Section of the Act before passing of the award under Section A any person interested in any land notified under Section can object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Under Section when the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report if any made under Section A that any land is needed for a public purpose or for a company a declaration shall be made to the effect Under Section if the appropriate Government is satisfied after considering the report of the Collector under Section A and on the report under Section that the proposed acquisition is for the purpose mentioned in Section it shall require the <ORG> to enter into an agreement providing for the following matters namely the payment to the appropriate Government of the cost of the acquisition the transfer on such payment of the land to the <ORG> the terms on which the land shall be held by the <ORG> where the acquisition for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses or the provision of amenities connected therewith the time within which the conditions on which and the manner in which the dwelling houses or amenities shall be erected or provided Under Section every such agreement shall be published in <ORG> and shall thereupon have the same effect as if it had formed part of the Act Power to make rules The appropriate Government shall have power to make rules consistent with this Act for the guidance of officers in all matters connected with its enforcement and may from time to time alter and add to the rules so made Provided that the power to make rules for carrying out the purposes of Part VII of this Act shall be exercisable by <ORG> and such rules may be made for the guidance of <ORG>s and the officers of <ORG> and of <ORG> Provided further In exercise of the powers so conferred under Section of the Act <ORG> has framed Rules called the Land Acquisition Companies Rules Arguments have proceeded on the basis that Rules and of the aforesaid Rules are mandatory It shall be duty of the <ORG> to advise the appropriate Government on all matters relating to or arising out of acquisition of land under part VII of the Act on which it is consulted and to tender its advice within one month from the date on which it is consulted Provided that the appropriate Government may on a request being made in this behalf by the committee and for sufficient reasons extend the said period to a further period not exceeding two months ii that the company has made all reasonable efforts to get such lands by negotiations with the persons interested therein on payment of reasonable price and such efforts have failed iii that the land proposed to be acquired is suitable for the purpose iv that the area of land proposed to be acquired is not excessive that the company is in a position to utilise the land expeditiously and vi where the land proposed to be acquired is good agricultural land that no alternative suitable site can be found so as to avoid acquisition of that land The Collector shall after giving the company a reasonable opportunity to make any representation in this behalf hold an inquiry into the matters referred to in sub rule and while holding such enquiry he shall i in any case where the land proposed to be acquired is agricultural land consult the Senior Agricultural Officer of the district whether or not such land is good agricultural land ii determine having regard to the provisions of Section and of the Act the approximate amount of compensation likely to be payable in respect of the land which in the opinion of the collector should be acquired for the company and iii ascertain whether the company offered a reasonable price not being less than the compensation so determined to the persons interested in the land proposed to be acquired No declaration shall be made by the appropriate <ORG> under Section of the Act unless i the appropriate Government has consulted the committee and has considered the report submitted under this rule and the report it any submitted under Section A of the Act and ii the agreement under Section of the Act has been executed by the company the Collector shall then cause public notice to be given at convenient places on or near the land to be taken stating that the government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land may be made to him Such notice shall state the particulars of the land so needed and shall require all persons interested in the land to appear personally or by agent before the collector at a time and place therein mentioned such time not being earlier than fifteen days after the date of publication of the notice and to state the nature of the respective interests in the land and the amount and particulars of their claims to compensation for such interests and their objections if any to the measurements made under Section The Collector may if any case requires such statement to be made in writing and signed by the party or his agent The Collector shall also serve notice to the same effect on the occupier if any of such land and on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein or to be entitled to act for persons so interested as reside or have agents authorized to receive service on their behalf within the revenue district in which the land is situate In case any person so interested reside elsewhere and has no such agent the notice shall be sent to him by post in a letter addressed to his last known residence address or place of business and registered under Sections and of the Indian Post Office Act It was also alleged that under Section the agreement entered into if any between <ORG> and <ORG> was required to be published in the official gazette and that no such agreement to the knowledge of the petitioner was published in any gazette In the counter affidavits filed in <ORG> both <ORG> and <ORG> denied the allegations so made by the petitioner the first respondent herein <ORG> did not give any reason as to how it reached the conclusion that Rules and had not been complied in the face of the record of the case Rather it returned a finding which is unsustainable that it was not possible on the basis of the material on record to hold that there was compliance with the rules and In this affidavit it was also stated that the Assistant Collector Surat prepared a detailed report which he submitted to the Collector and placed before the aforesaid Committee In this view of the matter it is difficult to understand as to how <ORG> said that there was no compliance with Rule by <ORG> when as a matter of fact as noted above there was no mention of non compliance with Rule in whole body of the writ petition It was conceded that there was no specific averment relating to rule As regards non compliance of Rule it was submitted that there was no independent report of the collector As a matter of fact only two contentions had been raised by the petitioners before <ORG> and that were that the land belonging to a cooperative housing society which itself was a public purpose could not be subject to acquisition and that Rule had not been complied It is a requirement of good pleading to give details i particulars as to why it is alleged that there is non compliance with a statutory requirement In the present case however we find that the <ORG> has more than justified its stand that there has been compliance not only with rule but with Rule as well though there was no challenge to rule and the averments regarding non compliance with Rule were sketchy and without any particulars whatsoever <ORG> was therefore not right in quashing the acquisition proceedings in SCA In Special leave petition No arising out of SCA it was submitted by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant <ORG> that the writ petition should have been dismissed by <ORG> on the ground of laches Mr <NAME> said in view of the law laid down by this court notification under Section has to be challenged within a reasonable time and for any petitioner to contend that it was challenged immediately after possession of the land was taken over was not a relevant circumstance to be taken into consideration He referred to averments made in the writ petition itself wherein petitioners themselves admitted that two separate notices under Section were served upon them as different portions of Survey No which were on the two sides of the canal were acquired These petitioners further stated that as soon as the notices were served on them they made an application to the Deputy Collector and special Land Acquisition Officer concerned stating that the land was being acquired contrary to law and that the decision of the Government was illegal It was also stated in the writ petition that various other points were also made in the representation to the Deputy Collector and Special Land Acquisition Officer In view of specific admission by the petitioners themselves it is difficult to appreciate how <ORG> could say that no notices under Section of the Act has been issued to the petitioners Mr <NAME> further pointed out that there was no occasion for <ORG> also to hold that there was non compliance of Rules and when it was not the case of the petitioners anywhere The fact that there was certainly no allegation of non compliance with Rules and in the writ petition has been admitted by learned counsel for the respondents to The petitioners filed affidavits of the <NAME> who had signed the <NAME> Affidavits of the <NAME> filed in <ORG> which contained statements contrary to what was recorded in the <NAME> and against the revenue entries are quite meaningless and in our opinion <ORG> unnecessarily put undue reliance on the same SCC to come to the conclusion that actual physical possession of the land was not taken over by the State SCR SCC a three Judge Bench of this <ORG> was considering the question of taking possession of the acquired land under the Act <NAME> <NAME> as he then was delivered judgment for himself and <NAME> <NAME> He said he agreed with the conclusion reached by <NAME> <NAME> who was the third Judge as also with the reasoning on which the conclusion was based <NAME> <NAME> said as under There can be no question of taking symbolical possession in the sense understood by judicial decisions under the code of civil Procedure What the Act contemplates as a necessary condition of vesting of the land in the <ORG> is the taking of actual possession of the land How such possession may be taken would depend on the nature of the land There can be no hard and fast rule laying down what act would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land We should not therefore be taken as laying down an absolute and inviolable rule tat merely going on the spot and making a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land in every case But here in out opinion since the land was lying fallow and there was no crop on it at the material time the act of he Tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and determining its extent was sufficient to constitute taking of possession It appears that the appellant was not present when this was done by the Tehsildar but the presence of the owner or the occupant of the land is not necessary to effectuate the taking of possession It is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or the occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time though it may be desirable where possible to give such notice before possession is taken by the authorities as that would eliminate the possibility of any fraudulent or collusive transaction of taking of mere paper possession without the occupant or the owner ever coming to know of it SCC the issue whether the land in question was taken possession of in proceedings under the Act It is not necessary for us to refer to the facts of that case We find the following statement of law relevant to the controversy in the present case It is settled law by series of judgments of this Court that one of the accepted modes of taking possession of the acquired land is recording of a memorandum of Panchanama by the <ORG> in the presence of witnesses winged by him them and that would constitute taking possession of the land as it would be impossible to take physical possession of the acquired land this Court again considered the same very question of taking possession of land and said as under It is seen that the entire gamut of the acquisition proceedings stood completed by by which date possession of the land had been taken No doubt <NAME> has contended that the appellant still retained their possession It is now well settled legal position that it is difficult to take physical possession of the land under compulsory acquisition The normal mode of taking possession is drafting the <ORG> in the presence of <NAME> and taking possession and giving delivery to the beneficiaries is accepted mode of taking possession of the land Subsequent thereto the retention of possession would tantamount only to illegal or unlawful possession It has brought on record an affidavit sworn in August of Mr <NAME> Deputy Secretary <ORG> of <ORG> wherein it is mentioned that the only requirement of Section of the Act it that the Government can withdraw from acquisition when possession of the land has not been taken He said the Government got verified the fact regarding possession of land in Survey No and that it had deputed an Under secretary <ORG> who after verifying the position at the site along with the Deputy Collector Surat and <NAME> Surat had drawn up a <ORG> dated July regarding actual physical possession of the land and as a matter of fact he noticed that whatever land <ORG> had acquired in Magdalla and possession taken had been fenced while land of Survey No has no fancing and that the same was in possession of the original owners There is on record a letter dated April addressed by the Assistant Collector <NAME> to the Government advocate giving his comments on the affidavit of the petitioner Respondent No in SCA Thus the statement made by Petitioner that there was a standing crop in it is false and in copy of of in village From No he name of <ORG> Company has been recorded as occupant After the aforesaid clear and unambiguous stand of the State Government it would appear there was rethinking in the State Government and a case was sought to be made out to justify that since no possession was taken over action under Section of the Act would acquire validity That apart the question of having taken possession of land would be more relevant in the case where the <ORG> is withdrawing from acquisition proceedings under Section of the Act Other findings of <ORG> that notices under Section of the Act had not been served upon the petitioners and that there was no compliance with Rules and of the Rules are also not correct Mr <NAME> also submitted that it was not the requirement of law to issue notices to interested parties under Section of the Act and he referred to a few decisions of this <ORG> In view of the fact however that there was no complaint of notices under Section not having been served on the respondents this question does not arise for consideration in this case This Court has repeatedly held that writ petition challenging the notifications issued under Section and of the Act is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches if challenge is not made within a reasonable time There are as many as respondents in this appeal respondents to being the persons whose land <ORG> has withdrawn from acquisition under Section of the Act It is admitted that though there is an order of <ORG> withdrawing from acquisition on notification has yet been issued in the official gazette and on that ground also appellant submits there could not be any valid withdrawal from acquisition and any action of the respondents in pursuance to that very decision of <ORG> to withdraw from acquisition would be illegal In support of his submission Mr <NAME> said that apart from the fact that there was no notification issued under Section of the Act making withdrawal from acquisition the reasons for withdrawal from acquisition are justiciable and the beneficiaries for whom the land is acquired are to be heard <ORG> held that Section created an absolute right as a dominion eminent in favour of the <ORG> which proposes to acquire the land to take unilateral decision to withdraw from the acquisition and there was no restriction on its powers to withdraw from acquisition except in a case where in pursuance to the acquisition proceeding owner of the land was dispossessed After the notifications had been issued under Section and of the Act notices under section were issued on April present writ petition SCA was filed by <ORG> on July when its protest against withdrawal from acquisition of the land to <ORG> failed I say that the said decision is bona fide can be seen from the applications were given by the land owners much prior to the date of the Election i as back as in March and the lane owners had pointed out various facts including the fact that there are various lands have been acquired in past and since they are poor agriculturists left with no other land their land should be released from acquisition For example in the case of <NAME> application was made on pointing out that his lands in village in Magdalla have been acquired for one purpose or the other with the result that he was left with no land Not only that but after the land were released from the acquisition the petitioner <ORG> has filed objections and representations against the same Thereafter having verified all the facts <ORG> was convinced that there was no reason to the change the said order and therefore <ORG> i Under Secretary Revenue Department informed the Deputy Collector by his letter dated that the instructions which were given in the previous letter stay order given is withdrawn Appellant said that there was no ground for <ORG> to withdraw from acquisition when proceeding for acquisition had been initiated as for back as in the year a submission was made that <ORG> for whom the notification was issued for acquiring the land for public purpose did not need the plots of land This Court observed that so long as there is no notification published under Section of the Act withdrawing from the acquisition the Court cannot take notice of any subsequent disinclination on the part of the beneficiary The Court said that it was settled law that once possession is taken by operation of Section the land vested in the State free from all encumbrances unless the notification under Section was published in the Gazette withdrawing from the acquisition The Court further said there is no other provision under the Act to have the acquired land divested unless as stated earlier notification under Section was published and the possession is surrendered pursuant thereto It was submitted before the Court which was the alternative argument that the withdrawal of certain land included in the notification under Section could be effected only by denotifying the release and that since there was no such notification denotifying the release it could not be regarded as a release within the meaning of Section of the Act and said in this view of the matter even if we assume that there was an order for release of certain land from acquisition the same could not be given effect to in the absence of a notification denotifying the acquisition of land <ORG> Struck down the order made under Section and directed and <ORG> to acquire the lands of the respondent owner It was submitted that the power to withdraw from acquisition was not absolute and was fettered by implicit restrictions and was thus justiciable The acquisition of land was challenged by the owner of the land by filling writ petition in <ORG> and an interim order was passed directing the parties to maintain status quo as regards possession it was submitted on behalf of the <ORG> that Section contained no words of limitation as regards the exercise of power and the only limitation put upon the power of the <ORG> Government was that it could exercise that power till possession of the land sought to be acquired was taken and not thereafter This Court observed that the decision in <NAME> and <NAME> case was no authority laying down the proposition that in all cases where power was exercised under Section of the Act it was open to the <ORG> Government to act unilaterally and that it could withdraw from acquisition without giving any reason or for any reason whatsoever Therefore we cannot accept the submission of the learned counsel for the <ORG> that the discretion of the <ORG> Government in this behalf is absolute and not justiciable at all He said that Section and talked of notification being issued under those provisions but there was no such mandate in Section Power to issue to include power to add to amend vary or rescind notifications orders rules or bye laws Where by any Central Act or Regulation a power to issue notification orders rules or bye laws is conferred then that power includes a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions if any to add to amend vary or rescind any notifications orders rules or bye laws so issued Rather it is Section under which after withdrawal from acquisition is made compensation due for any damage suffered by the owner during the course of acquisition proceedings is determine and given to him There is therefore no difficulty when it is the owner whose land is withdrawn from acquisition is concerned After notification under Section is issued when it appears to <ORG> that the land in any locality is needed for a company any person interested in such land which has been notified can file objections under Section A of the Act A declaration under Section of the Act is made by notification only after formalities under part VII of the Act which contains Section to have been complied and report of the Collector under Section A of the Act is before <ORG> who consents to acquire the land on its satisfaction that it is needed for the company The <ORG> may have sound reasons to withdraw from acquisition but those must be made known to the company which may have equally sound reasons or perhaps more which might persuade <ORG> to reverse its decision withdrawing from acquisition In this view of the matter it has to be held that <ORG>Memo dated and <ORG>Memo dated were issued without notice to the appellant <ORG> and are thus not legal A direction is issued to the respondents and to complete the acquisition proceeding in pursuance to the notification under Section and declaration under Section of the Land Acquisition Act
