Principles for considering constitutionality of law restricting or prohibiting carrying on a business By a notification on January in exercise of its powers under of Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act of <ORG> cancelled the confirmation of certain bye laws insofar as the bye laws relate to the slaughter of bulls and bullocks The petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the notification by a writ petition under Art It was contended on behalf of the respondent <ORG> that its power to rescind confirmation of the bye laws could not be challenged by reference to Art But a prohibition imposed on the exercise of a fundamental right to carry on an occupation trade or business will not be regarded as reasonable The power to issue bye laws indisputably includes the power to cancel or withdraw the bye laws but the validity of the exercise of the power to Issue and to cancel or withdraw the bye laws must be adjudged in the light of its impact upon the fundamental rights of persons affected thereby Where however power is entrusted to an administrative agency to grant or withhold a permit or licence in its uncontrolled discretion the law ex facie infringes the fundamental right under Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The petitioner <NAME> who carries on the vocation of slaughtering bulls and bullocks at the Madar Tekdi Slaughter House at Jabalpur claims a declaration that the notification dated January issued by the Governor of Madhya Pradesh in exercise of the powers conferred under sub of of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act of Cancelling confirmation of the bye laws made by <ORG> for inspection and regulation of slaughter houses in so far as the bye laws relate to slaughter of bulls and bullocks infringes the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Arts By it is made obligatory upon the <ORG> to make adequate provision for the construction maintenance and regulation of a slaughter house But on January the State <ORG> issued a notification cancelling the confirmation of the bye laws insofar as they related to slaughter of bulls and bullocks at Madar Tekdi Slaughter House The petitioners who followed the occupation of butchers and of dealing in the byproducts of slaughter houses challenged the validity of the three Acts on the plea that the Acts infringed their fundamental rights under Arts Attempts were made from time to time to circumvent the judg ment of this Court in <NAME> case Under the Madhya Pradesh Act slaughter of a bull bullock or buffalo except upon a certificate issued by the competent authority was prohibited In the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> of Madhya Pra desh two principal contentions were raised the power to rescind confirmation of the bye laws cannot be challenged by reference to Art The power to issue bye laws indisputably includes the power to cancel or withdraw the bye laws but the validity of the exercise of the power to issue and to cancel or withdraw the bye laws must be adjudged in the light of its impact upon the fundamental rights of persons affected thereby Where however power is entrusted to an administrative agency to grant or withold a permit or licence in its uncontrolled discretion the law ex facie infringes the fundamental right under Art and of the Constitution includes cases of prohibition also that where a restriction reaches the stage of total restraint of rights special care has to be taken by the <ORG> to see that the test of reasonableness is satisfied by considering the question in the background of the facts and circumstances under which the order was made taking into account the nature of the evil that was sought to be remedied by such law the harm caused to individual citizens by the proposed remedy the beneficial effect reasonably expected to result to the general public and whether the restraint caused by the law was more than what was necessary in the interests of the general public The <ORG> must in considering the validity of the impugned law imposing a prohibition on the carrying on of a business or profession attempt an evaluation of its direct and immediate impact upon the fundamental rights of the citizens affected thereby and the larger public interest sought to be ensured in the light of the object sought to be achieved the necessity to restrict the citizen freedom the inherent pernicious nature of the act prohibited or its capacity or tendency to be harmful to the general public the possibility of achieving the object by imposing a less drastic restraint and in the absence of exceptional situations such as the prevalence of a state of emergency national or local or the necessity to maintain essential supplies or the necessity to stop activities inherently dangerous the existence of a machinery to satisfy the administrative authority that no case for imposing the restriction is made out or that a less drastic restriction may ensure the object intended to be achieved But a prohibition imposed on the exercise of a fundamental right to carry on an occupation trade or business will not be regarded as reasonable if if is imposed not in the interest of the general public but merely to respect the susceptibilities and sentiments of a section of the people whose way of life belief or thought is not the same as that of the claimant It is unnecessary to consider the validity of of the Act which was sought to be challenged in the petition or to consider whether there has been any infringement of the guarantee of the equality clause of the Constitution The petitioner will be entitled to his costs in this Court
