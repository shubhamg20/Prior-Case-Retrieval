This Writ Petition coming on for hearing on this day upon perusing the petition and the affidavit filed in support thereof the order of <ORG> dated th May and made herein and the Counter affidavits filed herein and the records relating to the order relevant to the aforesaid prayer on the file of the st respondent comprised in the return of the st Respondent herein to the writ made by <ORG> and upon hearing the arguments of It is necessary to note the nature of the appeal filed by the second respondent because very much turns upon this After narrating the circumstances under which the letter of resignation came to be addressed it is stated in paragraph thus The Secretary exercised so much pressure and coercion that he compelled the appellant to then and there sign a letter of resignation which was dictated by the Secretary himself Therefore in law it cannot be said that the appellant had voluntarily terminated his services with the respondent Under Rule of the rules made under the Act an appeal ought to be filed within thirty days from the date of service of the order terminating the services with the employer Of course there is a proviso to the rule That says Provided that an appeal may be admitted after the said period of thirty days if the appellant satisfied the appellate authority that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within that period In paragraph of the counter it was stated thus The petitioner has approached <ORG> on the footing that there was an order of termination on th January Even assuming without admitting that there was an order of termination on th January the appeal under should have been filed within days of the order of termination and in the instant case by th February It would appear that the petitioner has filed the appeal on th May i after a delay of more than three months The appeal was taken up for hearing by the first respondent the appellant authority constituted under the Act A few witness were examined on the side of the appellant before it Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner wards off the preliminary objection as to the participation in the enquiry so as to disable him to raise the plea of jurisdiction by contending that there was nothing wrong in the petitioner seeking an adjudication on the condonation of delay that if he were to succeed that would be the end of the matter but on the contrary if he fails the enquiry would take place by an authority according to him which has no jurisdiction Moving on to merits the petitioner contends the <ORG> should certainly come to the rescue of the petitioner who seeks a prohibition when it is established on the facts alleged by the second respondent that he has no jurisdiction and more so when the first respondent proposes to assume jurisdiction which according to him it has not in law As per the wording of of the Act no employer shall dispense with the services of a person except for a reasonable cause or by way of misconduct where there is no dispensation with the service by the petitioner the employer but the dispensation was brought about by the act of resignation the court can have no jurisdiction What is required to be noted in this case is if there is no termination by the employer the fact that the resignation was brought about by coercion is not a matter which falls within the jurisdiction of the authority because the authority will then be assuming jurisdiction like that of a civil court as to whether the resignation was voluntary or not which falls totally outside the purview of of the Act and other II is cited for the proposition that this Court in a case arising under of the Act took the view that when a workman failed to turn up if his name was removed from the register or rolls that would not amount to termination From this it is sought to be argued that in such a case the first respondent will have every jurisdiction On these rulings it is submitted that there is every jurisdiction for the authority to go into the question of resignation because but for the coercion there was no resignation It is true the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act is an Act which provides for the regulation of conditions of work in shops commercial establishments restaurants theatres and other establishments Then again if the appellate authority is conferred with the jurisdiction to enquire into the question as to whether the resignation was brought about by coercion and therefore it is not a voluntary abandonment it would amount to assumption of jurisdiction like a Civil <ORG> enquiring into the question whether a particular contract is vitiated by anyone of the supervening elements spoken to under Ss to of the Contract Act There are the two aspects which alone could be enquired into under sub of above extracted This case definitely supports the petitioner to a greater extent From the very nature of the Language employed in only a premature termination of the services of an employee could be brought within the scope of that section thereby meaning a premature termination as the termination of the services of an employee prior to the period fixed in a contract of service if there is one or a termination of service prior to the period fixed for retirement on reaching the age of superannuation prescribed either in a contract of service if there is one or in the rules or regulations governing such service Consequently if there is a contract of service and the contract of service itself prescribes the period of service the termination of service of the employee pursuant to the expiry of such period of employment could not fall within the scope of the Equally if there are terms in the contract of service or provisions in the rules applicable to the service providing for the retirement of the employee on reaching the age of superannuation such a case also cannot fail within the scope of It may happen in a particular case that the retirement was used by the employer as a cloak for dispensing with the services of an employee where the motive for dispensing with the service is something different In the event different position may possibly result because no person will be allowed to evade the obligations imposed on him by law by having recourse to a cloak or guise under which he can take refuge in order escape from such an obligation In the course of the judgment Justice <NAME> as he then was observed It may happen in a particular case the retirement was used by the employer as a cloak for dispensing with the services of an employee where the motive for dispensing with the services is something different In that event a different position may possibly result because no person will be allowed to evade the obligation imposed on him by law by having recourse to a cloak or guise under which he can take refuge in order to escape from such an obligation In the present case the workman complained that his resignation was secured under threat and by that method his services were terminated by the employer Therefore I find great difficulty in accepting the ratio of this ruling <NAME> learned counsel for <ORG> raised the preliminary objection that we should not issue a writ of prohibition as the petitioner has his ultimate remedy by way of suit if a scheme came to be framed by the proper authorities under the new Act and that the application is therefore premature If the tribunal is permitted to exercise that jurisdiction which is objected to if it exercises it wrongly the mischief would be done before the alternative remedy is availed of It is unnecessary to insist upon a party complaining that he should first suffer and submit himself to the jurisdiction which is being wrongly exercised or is wrongly exceeded and then take advantage of the alternative remedy Similarly the fact that an appeal on the merits of the case has already failed or that the party applying for prohibition has himself initiated the proceedings in the inferior <ORG> is not material to the decision of the <ORG> to grant or to refuse the writ Similarly the fact than an appeal has already failed on the merits of the case or that the party applying for prohibition has himself initiated the proceedings in the inferior <ORG> is not material to the decision of the <ORG> to grant or to refuse the order Consequently the petitioner succeeds and the rule nisi is made absolute There is some force in the contention of Mr <NAME> that if jurisdiction were to be denied to the appellate authority in this case frequent resort to this questionable method will be head by the employers and thereby deprive the employee of the benefit of the social welfare legislative measures In the peculiar circumstances of the case I make no order as to costs
