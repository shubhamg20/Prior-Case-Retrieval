or take in mortgage any real property knowing such property to have been previously sold given or mortgaged to any other person subsequent to the above period and that the deed of sale gift or mortgage has not been registered and shall register his own deed in such case the deed of sale gift or mortgage of such subsequent purchaser donee or mortgagee which may have been registered shall not from the registry of it invalidate or be discharged in preference to the unregistered deed of sale gift or mortgage first executed provided the authenticity of the latter be established to the satisfaction of the <ORG> Act I of repeals all provisions in any regulation touching knowledge or notice of unregistered conveyances and enacts that unregistered titles shall be void as against any person claiming under a subsequent registered title notwithstanding notice of a prior unregistered title Act VIII of repeals Act XX of and is repealed by Act III of the Registration Act now in force but Section of Act VIII of is re enacted and is as follows Every document of the kinds mentioned in clauses and of Section shall if duly registered take effect as regards the property comprised therein against every unregistered document relating to the same property and not being a decree or order whether such unregistered document be of the same nature as the registered document or not was decided in by <NAME> and <NAME> who held that Section affects alike documents which it is optional as well as those which it is compulsory to register and its effect is not modified by the fact that the subsequent registered purchaser buys with full notice of a prior unregistered encumbrance that transactions evidenced by documents of either description are rendered of no effect by the subsequent execution and registration of a document relating to the same property that Act XIX of did away with the doctrine of notice which has never since been expressly revived There is nothing about notice to be found in the Acts of and The plain words of the Act are shall if duly registered take effect as regards the property comprised therein against every unregistered document relating to the same property The words are used without any qualification and we think we should not be giving effect to the Act if we treated the circumstance of defendants having notice of plaintiffs unregistered instrument as one which bars the operation of Section of the Registration Act The fraud alleged as appears from the report was that the vendor of the land having first sold it to the respondent in the appeal afterwards sold it to the appellant the appellant being aware of the prior sale to the respondent In every case in which a vendor sells to a person property which both he and the subsequent purchaser know that he has sold previously I should say that the vendor and second purchaser colluded to deprive the prior purchaser of his property With the greatest respect to Sir <NAME> and Mr Justice <NAME> it appears to me that they have placed a wrong construction on Act XIX of It is therein enacted that unregistered titles shall be void as against any person claiming under a subsequent registered title any alleged notice or knowledge of such prior conveyance or instrument notwithstanding decided in <NAME> says that where a registered purchaser had notice that his vendor had previously conveyed away the property to some third person by an unregistered conveyance it was contrary to equity and good conscience that his title though under a registered deed should be allowed to prevail was decided under Act XX of as the language employed in Section of the Acts of and by which preference is given to registered documents is the same as that used in Section of Act XX of the principle of those decisions is equally applicable and that if the defendant was in possession when the mortgage deed was executed to plaintiff or plaintiff had otherwise notice of defendant purchase then the plaintiff could derive no advantage from the registration of his mortgage decided so long ago as by Lord Chancellor <NAME> it was held that a person having notice of a prior purchase though it was not registered was bound thereby and that getting his own purchase first registered was a fraud and that the transaction was collusive It must be borne in mind that I am only considering the cases in which the registration of the instruments is optional and the case referred and the cases decided by the several <ORG> and already cited relate only to cases in which the value is under Section The first Madras Registration Act was the Regulation of and the reason for passing such a regulation is declared to be to prevent persons being defrauded by purchasing real property which may have been before sold and I assume that the intention of the other Registration Act was also to secure subsequent purchasers against prior secret conveyances and fraudulent encumbrance Section It is clear that from the passing of Act I of until it was repealed by Act XVI of notice of a prior sale unregistered would not affect a subsequent purchaser who had registered his instrument of title but when that Act I of was repealed the doctrine of notice affected all subsequent transaction Section By Section of Act III of it is enacted that any document conveying any right title or interest of the value of Section in immoveable property shall be registered and by Section any document of the same nature as above of a value of less than Section may be registered If the property purchased is of a less value than Section the purchaser may register or not as he thinks fit but if the former owner sells the same property subsequently to another who registers his sale deed the registered sale deed shall have priority over the unregistered subject however to any equitable rights the prior purchaser ha Section It is impossible to believe that the <ORG> intended that the doctrine of notice should not apply to the provisions of an Act which is silent on the point First the Judges were wrong when they held that all transactions evidenced by documents the registration of which is optional are rendered of no effect by the subsequent execution and registration of a document relating to the same property and secondly in holding that the doctrine of notice was done away with and required to be expressly revived and that the fact that the subsequent registered purchaser bought with full notice of a prior unregistered encumbrance did not modify Section of Act III of I am of opinion that if the subsequent purchaser had notice of a prior sale and agreed with the former owner to buy that which he knows to have been already sold that this is a fraud and dolus malus itself With reference to these observations I would answer the question referred in the negative The question referred for the decision of <ORG> is whether when it is proved that a subsequent encumbrancer under a registered conveyance had notice of a valid prior unregistered conveyance and of possession by such encumbrancer or of such conveyance without possession the <ORG> are bound to interpret Section of the Registration Act strictly so as to defeat the title of the prior encumbrancer The facts of the case in which the question arises are stated in the order of reference and I do not think it is necessary to recapitulate them i that fraud as contradistinguished from mere notice defeats the claim to priority under Section ii that notice is material in a suit for specific performance under Section of the Specific Relief Act and iii that when the registered purchase or mortgage is made or taken subject to the prior unregistered mortgage which is optionally registrable no question of priority arises and there is no real competition between the two transaction Section Another proposition of law mentioned in the leading case is that though the transaction evidenced by the prior unregistered document is valid in itself yet the title or interest created by it is liable to be defeated under the rule of priority by a valid later sale or mortgage evidenced by a duly registered document The reason is that otherwise no effect can be given to the rule which implies that a later registered title is intended to prevail against an earlier unregistered title It is also clear from Acts I and XIX of that in order to avert the danger arising to registered titles and interests in immoveable property from perjury committed in this country during investigations touching the facts of notice or knowledge and to give stability to such titles and interests the <ORG> declared in in express terms that notice was immaterial The course of legislation then in this country up to was thi Section It was the Regulation of that prescribed the rule of equity and good conscience as the law to be administered in matters to which the Hindu or Mahomedan law was not declared applicable Regulation XVII of introduced the doctrine of notice as part of that rule in connection with the registration of documents on the ground of fraud The policy consisted in constituting registration into a pre requisite of a valid sale or mortgage of immoveable property unless such sale and mortgage were petty transactions for or of less than Section in value and into a ground of priority even in regard to those transaction Section Hence it was considered by the learned Judges who took part in the leading case that they were not at liberty to import into the Registration Act the doctrine of notice and thereby to re open to any extent the door for perjury closed by the <ORG> in The policy indicated by them consisted in abolishing optional registration in cases falling under Section and declaring that an oral agreement is no evidence of a valid transaction except as specified in section There is thus this essential difference in the mode in which registration is enforced in this country viz Hence it was also presumed in the later cases that the <ORG> would have expressly revived the doctrine of notice if they had intended to revive it or referred to notice as they have done in the Specific Relief Act and the Indian Trusts Act On reconsideration it seems to me that the principle laid down in <NAME> <NAME> Ve Section and approved by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> Ir The facts found in the present case are that defendants No Section and executed to the plaintiffs father on November rd an usufructuary mortgage bond for Section and placed him in possession The District Judge reversed this decision holding that as third defendant had notice of the previous mortgage to plaintiffs father and possession thereunder his acceptance of the subsequent hypothecation deed was tainted with fraud The question now referred for the decision of <ORG> is whether when it is proved that a subsequent encumbrancer under a registered conveyance had notice of a vaild prior unregistered encumbrance and of possession thereunder or had notice of such conveyance without possession the Courts are bound to interpret Section of the Registration Act so as to defeat the title of the prior encumbrancer They are set out in the order of reference and there is no dispute as to their general tenor and effect It appears to me there is considerable force in this contention If Section Registration Act were to be construed as a categorical direction to give prior effect to a registered document in all cases it would follow that a registered document obtained by fraud coercion or from a minor or insane person would have to be given effect to in preference to a perfectly valid prior deed though unregistered I am sensible of the gravity of overruling a long course of decision Section But in the present case it not only appears that the leading case which those decisions followed was based upon a misapprehension but the case is in conflict with the course of decisions in England in the other <ORG> in India and also it appears to me with that justice and equity which the Courts are bound to administer Section of the Registration Act is as follows Every document of the kinds mentioned in clauses a and of Section and clauses a and of Section shall if duly registered take effect as regards the property comprised therein against every unregistered document relating to the same property and not being a decree or order whether such unregistered document be of the same nature as the registered document or not The earlier deed was followed by possession and the District Judge found that the second mortgagee was at the time when he took his mortgage aware of the prior mortgage and on the authority of <NAME> <NAME> Mad In that case it was held that transactions evidenced by unregistered instruments which it is optional a well as those which it is compulsory to register are rendered of no effect by the subsequent execution and registration of a document relating to the same property that Act XIX of did away with the doctrine of notice which has never since been expressly revived and that therefore knowledge or notice of a prior encumbrance did not bar the operation of Section of the Registration Act By Act I of however the Governor General in Council repealed all the provisions in Regulation XVII of touching knowledge or notice of previous unregistered conveyances and it was enacted that unregistered titles should be void as against any person claiming under a subsequent registered title notwithstanding notice of the prior unregistered title If it had been the intention of the <ORG> that Section should have the effect of conferring absolute priority on a registered instrument knowledge or notice of a prior title notwithstanding it must be presumed that the <ORG> would have said so and in the absence of any express enactment I cannot see why we should import into the section words which are not to be found there The Courts of this country are required in cases where no specific rule of law exists to act according to justice equity and good conscience Act III of Section and so long as the principles of equity are not declared by express legislative enactment as in the years to be of no avail as a defence to an action the Courts are bound not to decide cases on inequitable principle Section The Court will not allow him to do the wrong himself nor will it suffer any third person to help him to do it Section of the Specific Relief Act which came into force in the month following Act III of provides that specific performance of a contract shall not be enforced against a transferee for value who has paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original contract As in the case of mortgages registration still remains optional the title of the registered purchaser or mortgagee prevails notwithstanding the priority in time of the unregistered instrument provided there is no notice of the prior title from which fraud can be inferred I would point out that the question referred is not of so much importance as would appear at first sight because all transfers of immoveable property by way of sale or mortgage executed since st July the date on which the Transfer of Property Act came into force if by writing must be by a registered instrument whether the value of the property or amount of the mortgage be or he not less than Section I agree to its being answered in the negative on the understanding that it relates only to cases when the prior instrument of mortgage is one the registration of which is optional Subject to the foregoing remarks I agree to the question referred being answered in the negative For the doctrine of notice which that decision declared to be inapplicable to the case of a contest between a registered and an unregistered instrument is founded as I understand it upon the principle that <ORG> of equity will not allow fraud to be perpetrated under cover of a statute if they can help it And the language of Sir william grant in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Ve Section referred to in the order of reference shows that he also considered the doctrine of notice to rest on fraud But the foundation of the decisions was the determination not to allow fraud to prevail if the <ORG> could prevent it I would put the decision upon the ground that Section of the Registration Act contemplates a conflict between two bond fide transactions relating to the same property and not a case where a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee having notice that there is a bond fide and valid encumbrance on the property seeks to make use of the Registration Act to avoid it thus making an enactment intended to prevent fraud an instrument of fraud
