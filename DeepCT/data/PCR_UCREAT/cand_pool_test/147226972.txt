But as we shall presently see the law on account of recent judgments concerning the services of a probationer is fairly well settled and there is no cause for being confounded or bewildered The perplexity which at one time surrounded the torrid question involved in this case has yielded to the clarity of reasons propounded by this <ORG> from time to time in recent times to which a reference shall be made during the course of this discussion He completed his period of probation on th of September but a year later on th of July his services were terminated by a simple notice in terms of Rule of the Temporary <ORG> Servants Termination of Service Rules It is further contended that the courts including the <ORG> constituted under the Public Services <ORG> Act have full jurisdiction to go behind the order to find out whether it was an order of termination simpliciter or it was an order passed by way of punishment It is pointed out that this aspect of the matter was considered by the <ORG> which on the basis of the facts set out in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents as also the entire service record of the appellant which was produced before it came to the conclusion that the order was punitive in nature Learned counsel for the respondents has on the contrary contended that the appellant was a temporary employee and therefore his services could be terminated at any time by giving him a month notice in terms of Temporary <ORG> Servants Termination of Service Rules The respondents admitted in the counter affidavit that there was no adverse material against the appellant before the incident in question A Varanasi and in the preliminary enquiry report he concluded at pages to that the petitioner along with others had indulged in a misconduct of hurling blows and used filthy language to the superior officers of the Department and he was found guilty along with others for the said misconduct and misbehaviour Thereafter on internal page the impugned order of termination dated was passed in respect of the petitioner and on the same day he was served the copy of the order Now it is well settled that the temporary <ORG> servants or probationers are as much entitled to the protection of Article of the Constitution as the permanent employees despite the fact that temporary government servants have no right to hold the post and their services are liable to be terminated at any time by giving them a month notice without assigning any reason either in terms of the contract of service or under the relevant statutory rules regulating the terms and conditions of such service The courts can therefore lift the veil of an innocuously worded order to look at the real face of the order and to find out whether it is as innocent as worded SCR the order by which the services of the employee were terminated was an order simpliciter in nature which was innocuously worded but it was held by this <ORG> that the form of the order was not decisive and the <ORG> could go behind that order to find out whether it was founded upon the misconduct of the employee It was held that since no punitive action was taken against the appellant there was no question of the applicability of Article of the Constitution If the order visits the public servant with any evil consequences or casts an aspersion against his character or integrity it must be considered to be one by way of punishment no matter whether he was a mere probationer or a temporary servant SCR AIR SC and it was laid down that in order to attract the provisions of Article it has to be seen whether the misconduct or negligence was a mere motive for the order of reversion or termination or whether it was the very foundation of that order It was however laid down that if the order visits the employee with penal consequences the order would be punitive In the same year came the <ORG> decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> vs <ORG> of Punjab AIR SC SCR in which Motive and Foundation theory was reiterated and it was laid down that the question whether an order terminating the services of a temporary employee or a probationer was by way of punishment or not would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case The form of the order it was observed was not conclusive and an innocuously worded order terminating the services of a temporary employee or a probationer may in the facts of the case be found to have been passed on account of serious and grave misconduct in utter violation of Article of the Constitution But the application of the same law to the different circumstances and facts of various cases which have come up to this <ORG> could create the impression sometimes that there is some conflict between different decisions of this <ORG> One additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts On the facts and circumstances of that case it was held that the question whether the appellant who was a temporary servant should be retained in service directly arose during the drive launched to weed out unsuitable officers and it was for this reason that the termination order was upheld particularly as there was nothing to show that the termination order was made by way of punishment It was also observed that since in regard to a temporary employee or an officiating employee an assessment of the service is necessary merely because the <ORG> proceeds to make an assessment and records its views it would not be available to be utilised to make the order of termination following such assessment punitive in character It was observed by this <ORG> that in the relationship of master and servant there is a moral obligation to act fairly It was urged before this <ORG> more than once including in <NAME> case supra that there was a conflict of decisions on the question of order being a simple termination order or a punitive order but every time the <ORG> rejected the contention and held that the apparent conflict was on account of different facts of different cases requiring the principles already laid down by this <ORG> in various decisions to be applied to a different situation The important principles which are deducible on the concept of motive and foundation concerning a probationer are that a probationer has no right to hold the post and his services can be terminated at any time during or at the end of the period of probation on account of general unsuitability for the post in question But if there are allegations of misconduct and an enquiry is held to find out the truth of that misconduct and an order terminating the service is passed on the basis of that enquiry the order would be punitive in nature as the enquiry was held not for assessing the general suitability of the employee for the post in question but to find out the truth of allegations of misconduct against that employee An order terminating the services of an employee is an act done by the employer If however there were allegations of serious misconduct against the employee and a preliminary enquiry is held behind his back to ascertain the truth of those allegations and a termination order is passed thereafter the order having regard to other circumstances would be founded on the allegations of misconduct which were found to be true in the preliminary enquiry There is another aspect of the matter Immediately after quoting the Rule the <ORG> observed Notice to show cause whether the employment of the respondent should be terminated was by Rule made obligatory If such an opportunity is given to a probationer and his explanation in reply thereto is given due consideration there is in our opinion sufficient compliance of Generally speaking the purpose of a notice under is to ascertain after considering the explanation which a probationer may give whether he should be retained or not and in such a case it would be sufficient compliance with that rule if the grounds on which the probationer is considered unsuitable for retention are communicated to him and any explanation given by him with respect to those ground is duly considered before an order is passed As we have already seen above there has been total non compliance with the provisions of Para of <ORG> Regulations and services of the appellant were terminated without ever issuing him any notice intimating the grounds on which his services were proposed to be terminated nor was his explanation ever obtained For the reasons stated above the appeal is allowed the impugned judgment passed by the High <ORG> is set aside and that of the Public Services <ORG> is restored but without any order as to costs
