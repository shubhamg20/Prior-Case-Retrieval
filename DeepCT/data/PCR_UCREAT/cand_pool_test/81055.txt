The assessee company had sold some of its old machinery and buildings resulting in balancing charges contemplated by section which worked out to Rs arising under Section had been wrongly allowed and that for the purpose of calculating the deduction of the items in respect of the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate should not have been excluded and that if proper calculations as suggested by him were made the assessee was not entitled to any deduction By its judgment dated th and th of December disposing of the Reference <ORG> upheld the view of the <ORG> regarding the item of Rs Both the assessee and the <ORG> preferred separate appeals against the said judgment It is true that by legal fiction created under a balancing charge arising from sale of old machinery or building is treated as deemed income and the same is brought to tax in other words the legal fiction enables the <ORG> to take back what it had given by way of depreciation allowance in the preceding years since what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given Whenever the <ORG> wanted to give a restricted meaning it has used the expression derived from as for instance in Since the expression of wider import namely attributable to has been used the legislature intended to cover receipts from sources other than the actual conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity Having regard to the construction placed on sub of Section as above it is obvious that in computing the total income of the concerned assessee items of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate will have to be deducted before arriving at the figure that will become exigible to the deduction of contemplated by In sub of the expression total income is followed by the words as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression total income has been used in the sense of commercial profits The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR These two appeals by special leave one by the Commissioner of Income Tax Gujarat and the other by the assessee against the judgment of Gujarat <ORG> in Income Tax Reference No of raise two interesting questions regarding the mode in which and the fund from which deduction of contemplated by section of the Income Tax Act as it stood at the relevant time should be computed The short facts giving rise to the questions may be stated The assessee <ORG> carries on the Business of generation and distribution of electricity at Cambay and as such is covered by the provisions of and is entitled to claim the deduction contemplated by the said provision arising under had been wrongly allowed and that for the purpose of calculating the deduction of the items in respect of the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate should not have been excluded and that if proper calculations as suggested by him were made the assessee was not entitled to any deduction Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax the assessee preferred an appeal to <ORG> The <ORG> accordingly allowed the appeal set aside the order of the Additional Commissioner and restored that of the income Tax Officer In other words <ORG> upheld the view of the <ORG> on the first question while on the second question it took the view that the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate were deductible before arriving at the figure that would be exigible to the deduction of under and therefore Civil Appeal No NT of has been preferred by the <ORG> in so far as the answer to the first question has gone against it while Civil Appeal No NT of has been preferred by the assessee inasmuch as the second question has been answered in favour of the <ORG> He contended that a balancing charge contemplated under is really in the nature of a return of capital and not a return of revenue and it is only by reason of the fiction created by that the same is deemed to be a revenue receipt and has been made chargeable to income tax as income of the business but it is well settled that a legal fiction is to be limited to the purpose for which it is created and should not be extended beyond its legitimate field He pointed out that in the first place requires the computation of the total income of the assessee carrying on specified industry in accordance with the other provisions of this Act secondly such total income so computed should include profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity and thirdly it is from such profits attributable to the business of the specified industry that the deduction of should be made In our view the answer to the question raised before us really turns upon the proper construction of the provision contained in of the Act rather than on what is the real nature or character of a balancing charge arising under of the Act and it would therefore be proper to set out the provisions of as it stood at the relevant time In the case of a company to which this section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent thereof in computing the total income of the company This section applies to a an Indian company or any other company which has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends including dividends on preference shares within India us that the assessee being an Indian company engaged in the business of generation and distribution of electricity is a company to which the section applies and is entitled to claim the deduction of contemplated by that provision and the only question is how and in what manner the said deduction should be computed In the case of <ORG> supra the question that arose for determination was whether a balancing charge which was brought to tax on the basis of deemed income and was therefore included in the assessable income of an assessee under the second proviso to cl vii of sub of of the Act equivalent to of the Act could be taken into account while considering smallness of profit for purposes of deciding whether the case attracted the applicability of A of the Act and this <ORG> took the view that the balancing charge was not real income but was made taxable income for the purpose of computation of the assessable income by legal fiction but on that account it did not become commercial profit and was not liable to be taken into account in assessing whether in view of the smallness of profits a larger dividend would be unreasonable in that context this <ORG> observed that what in truth was a capital return was by a fiction regarded for the purposes of the Act as income and was made chargeable to income tax but because of that its character was not altered and it was not converted into assessee business profits and that smallness of profit in A had to be adjudged in the light of commercial principles and not in the light of total receipts actual or fictional It is true that by a legal fiction created under a balancing charge arising from sale of old machinery or building is treated as deemed income and the same is brought to tax in other words the legal fiction enables the <ORG> to take back what it had given by way of depreciation allowance in the preceding years since what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given It was rightly pointed out by the learned Solicitor General that legal fictions are created only for a definite purpose and they should be limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond their legitimate field As regards the aspect emerging from the expression attributable to occurring in the phrase profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity on which the learned Solicitor General relied it will be pertinent to observe that the <ORG> has deliberately used the expression attributable to and not the expression derived from Had the expression derived from been used it could have with some force been contended that a balancing charge arising from the sale of old machi nery and buildings cannot be regarded as profits and gains derived from the conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity In this connection it may be pointed out that whenever the <ORG> wanted to give a restricted meaning in the manner suggested by the learned Solicitor General it has used the expression derived from as for instance in For the aforesaid reasons and particularly on true construction of the provision itself we are of the view that both the <ORG> and <ORG> were right in taking the view that the item of Rs In the first place before <ORG> it was strenuously urged though not seriously before us that the expression total income appearing in has been used in its commercial sense and since neither the unabsorbed depreciation nor the unabsorbed development rebate has anything to do with commercial profits in sub of the expression total income is followed by the words as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression total income has been used in the sense of commercial profits It may be stated that the first two decisions did not deal with the question of unabsorbed depreciation or unabsorbed rebate but merely dealt with the question of carried forward losses in the context of while the third decision dealt with all the three things carried forward loss carried forward depreciation and carried forward development rebate in the context of and it was held that the deduction under will have to be worked out before setting off or adjusting each of the three things In that case <ORG> held that as regards carried forward loss the point was covered by its earlier decision in <NAME> case supra that unabsorbed development rebate stood on the same footing as unabsorbed losses and as regards unabsorbed depreciation it took the view that since itself postponed the adjustment of unabsorbed depreciation to a stage subsequent to the set off of business losses under and set off of the losses in speculation business under the unabsorbed depreciation cannot be The question that arises for consideration therefore is whether the view taken in regard to non deductibility of carried for I It is true that in the instant case the question of deductibility or otherwise of carried forward losses of earlier years in the context of has not directly arisen before us but since counsel for the assessee has raised a contention about non deductibility of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate on the basis of the view taken by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and <ORG> in <NAME> case supra in regard to nondeductibility of unabsorbed losses of earlier years we are constrained to express our opinion on the validity of the view taken in those two cases In our opinion the view taken in <ORG> case supra and <NAME> case supra in regard to the nondeductibility of unabsorbed losses of the earlier years in the context of computing the deduction under of the Act is open to grave doubts Section Also provides that in computing the total income of an assessee there shall be included all income on which no income tax is payable under Chapter VII etc What is provided in section is also relating to computation Similarly the same words are used in section But there are no such words in section The Court has further observed that in its opinion the deduction under is a special benefit given to a company which satisfies the conditions under section and the deduction permissible thereunder is only from profits and gains attributable to the specified activities and this benefit should not be diminished by the other benefits conferred by the Act such as the right to have the previous losses set off that the two serve different purposes and the benefit of both must be available to an assessee without the one impinging on the other It will thus appear that <ORG> has regarded section appear ing in Chapter VI as a provision unconnected with the computation of the total income of an assessee and a provision which comes into operation at a stage subsequent to the computation of the total income arising from business done in accordance with ss to A occurring in Chapter IV of the Act and therefore the unabsorbed losses cannot be set off before calculating the deduction under It is not possible to accept the view that has no bearing on or is unconnected with the computation of the total income of an assessee under the head Profits and gains of business or profession The decision was rendered on the language of but it cannot avail the assessee on the point raised in the appeal
