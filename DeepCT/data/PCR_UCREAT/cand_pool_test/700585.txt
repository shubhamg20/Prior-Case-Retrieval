The dispute arises on certain contracts made between the plaintiffs and the defendants all of which are in the same form the form being Ex Upon the question whether there is a condition precedent that the matter should be referred to arbitration the only material part of the contract is that which I have read Now in order to determine the question what the words subject to the Rules and Regulations of the East India Cotton <ORG> Limited mean and whether they make arbitration a condition precedent one has to acquaint oneself with the position of that <ORG> Then Section gives the board which is the board of directors of the <ORG> power subject to the sanction of of Governor in Council to make by laws for the regulation and control of transactions in cotton and a lot of subjects are specified which may be covered by the by laws It is to be noticed therefore that under that Act Section and Section both cover the case of non members whereas in Section there is no reference to non members The articles are for the most part in the common form of articles used by companies registered under the Indian Companies Act and of course in reading articles one has to remember the provisions of Section of the Indian Companies Act which provides The memorandum and articles shall when registered bind the company and the members thereof to the same extent as if they respectively had been signed by each member and contained a covenant on the part of each member his heirs and legal representatives to observe all the provisions of the memorandum and of the articles subject to the provisions of this Act So that although that article seems to deal with persons who are not members it does not have any effect except so far as the by laws provide Article provides as follows Whenever any difference arises between Members or Associate Members or Special Associate Members or between one or more of them and another or others who are not Members or Associate Members or Special Associate Members touching or in connection with the cotton trade or any transaction therein it shall be referred to arbitration in such manner as shall be prescribed by the by laws And it is hereby expressly declared that the holding of such an arbitration which seems to be an arbitration between members or between members and non members and the obtaining of an award thereunder shall be a condition precedent to the right of any Member or Associate Member or Special Associate Member or non Member to commence legal proceedings against any other Member or Associate Member or Special Associate Member or non Member in respect of any such difference as aforesaid and any Member or Associate Member or Special Associate Member or non Member shall have no right of action against any other Member or Associate Member or Special Associate Member or non Member except to enforce the award in any such arbitration In order to bind non members it will be necessary to show that it has been given some special statutory effect The next document to consider is the by laws which contain provisions for arbitration in Clause which deals with arbitrations in respect of disputes ass to quality and Clause which deals with other disputes This case falls under Clause and not Clause because there is no dispute here as to quality Clause provides that All unpaid claims whether admitted or not and all disputes other than those relating to quality arising out of or in relation to a contracts whether forward or ready and whether between members or between a member and a non member made subject to these by laws or the rights and or responsibilities of commission agents muccadums and brokers not parties to such contracts shall be referred to the arbitration of two disinterested persona one to be chosen by each disputant I can see nothing in that clause to make arbitration a condition precedent to the right to bring an action It seems to me to be an ordinary provision for referring disputes to arbitration and such a provision does not in any way oust the jurisdiction of the <ORG> If an action is brought in respect of a matter covered by the arbitration clause the defendant can apply under the Indian Arbitration Act to stay the action but it is not open to him to say that the action does not lie I have no doubt that in many contexts a reference to regulations of the <ORG> would mean the articles and nothing else but the question is whether in this commercial contract the parties when they say the contract is made subject to the rules and regulations of the <ORG> mean anything more than the by laws Articles of association prima facie according to the ordinary law bind nobody except the <ORG> and the members of the <ORG> and it seems to no that the parties here when they refer to rules and regulations this contract are referring only to the by laws and not to the articles of association As a matter of construction of this contact I hold that the contract is made subject to the by laws of he <ORG> but not subject to the articles of association He held that this arbitration provision is part of the administrative machinery and that under Section it must have the force of an Act of <ORG> Why it was thought necessary to make that provision in the Act I do not know It may very well be that some of the provisions of the articles were thought not to comply or that there might be a question whether they complied with the Indian Companies Act or it may have been thought that there was some question as to there being provisions in restraint of trade or in the nature of wagering or something of that sort Whatever the reason for its enactment it seems to me that all that provision in Section of the Act means is that the constitution and administrative machinery as set out in the articles are not to be challenged as being illegal but it seems to me quite impossible to say that the whole of the provisions of the articles relating to the constitution and administrative machinery are to have the force of law The next point raised on the appeal which is the subject though I think not rightly the subject of cross objections by the defendants is this that the contract in this case does not comply with Clause of the by laws Clause of the by laws which were in force at the date of this contract provides that Contracts between Agents and their constituents between a member and a non member or between a member acting as an agent and a member acting as his constituent shall be subject to the by laws and shall be in writing in the form given in the Appendix pages and Then it goes on A member whose constituent has agreed in writing to sign the prescribed form of contract and fails or refuses to do so after terms have been arranged shall be treated in all respects as if he had done so and both parties shall have the rights and remedies accorded by these by laws The learned Judge in this case held that the documents to which I shall refer in a moment amounted to a substantial compliance with the terms of the by law that is to say substantially they amounted to the same thing as the form of contract set out in the schedule to the by laws although they were not in fact in that form but in a later case he seems to have receded from that position I see no reason why Clause of the by laws should not mean what it says i that the contract between the agents and their constituents shall be in writing in the form given in the Appendix At any rate whatever the reason for this by law it says plainly that the contract shall be in the form given in the appendix Looking at the documents in this case it is perfectly plain that they are not in the form given in the appendix Mr <NAME> says that he can bring the case within the second part of by law because he says that the defendants agreed in writing to sign the prescribed form of contract and there was failure by the defendants to sign it Now I am quite unable to find any agreement by the defendants to sign the prescribed form of contract But it seems to me impossible to give that meaning to the phrase I see no reason to suppose that defendants intended to be bound by two contracts or were requesting the plaintiffs to procure two forms of contract for them to sign And then comes Exhibit A a confirmation notice which the plaintiffs sent to the defendants stating that they have received from their Bombay friends i the brokers a telegram advising sale on defendants account of such and such quantity of cotton subject to usual terms of their contract of which please take note Their contract must I think mean the contract which the brokers have entered into for the sale of the cotton So far as the evidence goes the parties never had any such form of contract as required by the by laws they never discussed it and I see no ground on which it can be held that the defendants have either signed such a contract or agreed to sign such a contract or that they ever heard of such a contract and if that is so they cannot have failed or refused to sign such a contract As to the first point which was raised that the constitution of <ORG> which compels all disputes arising in the cotton trade even amongst persons who are not members of that <ORG> to be referred to arbitration has the force of law I am of the same opinion as my Lord the Chief Justice If it had been intended to give them the force of law and to make them binding on persona whether or not members of that <ORG> I can see no reason why the legislature should not have said so Then as regards the second point that supposing a reference to arbitration not to be made compulsory by law still it is so made in this case by agreement between the parties I am of the same opinion as my Lord the Chief Justice that the agreement to be bound by the rules and regulations of <ORG> does not necessarily import Article of the articles of association into the contract between the parties The next point is one to which it seems there is really no answer There is a great deal of difference between that form and the form employed by the parties when the defendants originally asked the plaintiffs to purchase and sell certain cotton on their behalf There is nothing of the kind in the form which was signed by the defendants in the present ease a form bearing the name of the plaintiffs firm and apparently a private form printed by plaintiffs for their own private purposes and although it contains a reference to the rules and regulations of <ORG> it cannot by any stretch of language be regarded as the form given in the appendix to the by laws of that <ORG> Moreover in the present case there is no agreement by the defendants to sign the prescribed form of contract and there can be no failure or refusal to sign the form when no such form has been tendered to them for signature In these circumstances I do not see how any endorsements made on other documents which have no relation to these by laws can amount to an agreement in writing to sign the specific form which is annexed to the bylaws of <ORG> In these circumstances the appeal must fail although our reasons are somewhat different from those of the learned Judge who tried the case and I agree with the order proposed by the learned Chief Justice
