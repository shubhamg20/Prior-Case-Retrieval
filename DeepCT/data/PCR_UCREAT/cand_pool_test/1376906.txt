In the case before as the buyer appellant had the matter referred to arbitration and his grounds of complaint were stated in these terms That the goods are not in terms of the contract and are not covered thereby Consequently the true position is that the appellant invoked the aid of the arbitrators on grounds some of which did while the others did not justify the exercise of theirs jurisdiction When the matter went before the arbitrators they delivered an award which set out the grounds of complaint as mentioned above and then proceeded to formulate the decision We have carefully examined all evidence put before us and a ward concealment of contract In these circumstances when we cannot hold with certainty that the arbitrators acted exclusively on grounds within their jurisdiction we must apply the principle that if the bad is not separable from the good the whole is bad and pronounce the award null and void <NAME> <NAME> Beav The result is that the decree made by Mr Justice <NAME> is affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs
