HEADNOTE In <ORG> called upon the prede cessor in title of the <ORG> of Bombay to remove some markets from a certain site and vacate it and on the appli cation of the then Municipal Commissioner the <ORG> passed a resolution approving and authorising the grant of another site to the Municipality The resolution stated further that the <ORG> do not consider that any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be like other public buildings for the benefit of the whole community The <ORG> sued for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and that it was entitled to hold the land for ever without payment of any assessment <ORG> held applying the principle of <NAME> <NAME> that the <ORG> had lost its right to assess the land in question by reason of the equity arising on the facts of the case in favour of the <ORG> and there was thus a limitation on the right of the <ORG> to assess under of the said Act Held per <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> limited title it had been prescribing for during the period that is to say the right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent but only for the purposes of a market and for no other purposes Even otherwise if there was merely the holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the future the <ORG> must be deemed to have bound themselves to fulfil it delivered on February in an appeal filed under section of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act of against the judgment of the Revenue Judge at Bombay delivered on October in a suit filed by the respondents <ORG> and <NAME> the then Municipal Commissioner for the City of Bom bay against the Collector of Bombay There is no substantial dispute as to the facts leading up to this litigation and they may be shortly stated The plans should be submitted for approval but Government do not consider any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be like other public buildings for the benefit of the whole community On March the appellant Collector of Bombay informed the respondent Municipal Commissioner that it was proposed to assess the land occupied by the Crawford Market under section of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act II of and asked for certain information to enable him to do so The appellant Collector of Bombay having insisted that in spite of the <ORG> Resolution of the <ORG> had the right to assess the site the Mayor of Bombay on March wrote a letter to the <ORG> stating inter alia as follows The <ORG> have been advised that there can be no doubt that it was the intention of <ORG> to make a permanent grant of the land to the Municipality and fur ther that it was also the intention that permanent grant should be free from rent and from assessment to land reve nue The present suit was thereupon filed in <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act for the following reliefs inter alia a that it may be declared that there is a right on the part of the plaintiff <ORG> in limitation of the right of Government to assess the said land and that the plaintiff <ORG> is entitled to hold the said land for ever without payment of any assessment and that the Govern ment has no right to assess the said premises That the said assessment may be declared ultra vires invalid and may be ordered to be set aside By his judgment dated October the learned Revenue Judge dismissed the suit with costs In the result <ORG> reversed the decision of the learned Revenue Judge allowed the appeal and passed a decree declaring the rights of the respondent <ORG> and awarding to it the costs in both Courts The Collector of Bombay appealed to <ORG> and the appeal has now come up for hearing before us Where there is no right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of <ORG> to assess the assessment shall be fixed at the discre tion of the Collector subject to the control of <ORG> When there is a right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of <ORG> in consequence of a specific limit to assessment having been established and preserved the assessment shall not exceed such specific limit The sole question for our consideration is whether on the facts of this case the respondent <ORG> has succeeded in establishing in itself a right in limitation of the right of the <ORG> to assess the land in conse quence of a specific limit to assessment having been estab lished and preserved There is no dispute that by reason of the non compliance with the statutory formalities the Gov ernment Resolution of is not an effectual grant passing title in the land to the respondent <ORG> and is not also an enforceable I A On the other hand there is no doubt as to the existence of an intention on the part of the <ORG> to make and on the part of the <ORG> to take a grant of the land in terms of the Resolution of including an undertaking by the <ORG> not to charge any rent What in the circumstances was the legal position of the respondent <ORG> and its predecessor in title in relation to the land in question They were in possession of the land to which they had no legal title at all Therefore the position of the respondent <ORG> and its predecessor in title was that of a person having no legal title but nevertheless holding possession of the land under color of an invalid grant of the land in perpetuity and free from rent for the purpose of a market This possession has continued openly as of right and uninterruptedly for over years and the respondent <ORG> has acquired the limited title it and its predecessor in title had been prescribing for during all this period that is to say the right to hold the land in perpetuity free from rent but only for the purposes of a market in terms of the <ORG> Resolution of There is no question of acquisition by adverse possession of the <ORG> prerogative right to levy assessment What the respondent <ORG> has acquired is the legal right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent for the specific purpose of erecting and maintaining a market upon the terms of the <ORG> Resolution as if a legal grant had been made to it It has not been suggested before us that there are no cases of total exemption or that those cases are protected by any provision of law other than that of this very sec tion There is therefore no escape from the conclusion arrived at by <ORG> with which we concur that the words of section would apply to a case where total exemp tion from assessment was granted In the premises the appellant cannot be permit ted at this stage to raise this contention rounded on the supposed distinction if any between rent and land revenue and for the purpose of this case we must proceed on the basis that the word rent in the <ORG> Resolution of was synonymous with or included land revenue In our opinion for reasons stated above the actual decision of <ORG> was correct and this appeal should be dismissed with costs and we order accordingly <NAME> of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and I will briefly indicate my reasons without recapitulating the facts which have been fully stated in the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> which I have had the advantage of reading It has been held and it is not now disputed that the words quoted above cover a right of total exemption from assessment the specific limit in such a case being nil see <NAME> Collector of Bombay There is in my opin ion no room here for the application of the principle of <NAME> Dyson They observed Whether an English equitable doctrine should in any case be applied so as to modify the effect of an Indian statute may well be doubted but that an English equitable doctrine affecting the provisions of an English statute relating to the right to sue upon a contract should be applied by analogy to such a statute as the Transfer of Property Act and with such a result as to create without any writing an interest which the statute says can only be created by means of a registered instrument appears to their Lordships in the absence of some binding authority to that effect to be impossible After quoting the well known passage in the judgment of Lord Kingsdown their Lordships commented thus It will be noticed that Lord <NAME> is dealing with the case of express verbal contract or something which amounts to the same thing After these decisions of <ORG> elucidating the principles underlying Ramsden Dyson and <NAME> Alderson it seems to me clear that they have no application to the facts of the present case There is no question here of acquisition of a limited interest in land by adverse possession If the <ORG> had given effect to their expressed intention by executing an instru ment in writing observing the due formalities the respond ent would no doubt have secured a valid title to the property with a contract binding the <ORG> not to charge revenue supported as it was by consideration The law may presume the existence of a grant which has been lost where it is sought to disturb a person in the enjoyment of right which he and his predecessors have immemorially enjoyed but it is a different thing to seek to presume that the <ORG> has by some lost grant deprived itself of the prerogative power to tax the property of its subjects and their Lordships are of opinion that this plea is untenable I would allow the appeal but make no order as to costs <NAME> had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by my learned brother Mr Justice <NAME> and agree in the conclusion he has reached but i wish to add a few words of my own on some of the points that have been discussed during the course of the hearing It is true that this word is used generally in cases of landlord and tenant but when it is remembered that here the Govern ment was parting with the land vested in the <ORG> in favour of <ORG> it can safely be assumed or presumed that they were thinking not merely of their rights as landlord but also of their prerogative right as well The Resolution in question authorized the grant of the site It is part of the same transaction with which we are concerned now and it seems to me that there was no valid grant There the question was brought before the Court well within the years period It is unnecessary to go into the wider question whether the denial of the right to levy assessment and possession of property coupled with this denial for over a period of years will negative that right it is sufficient to say that no right to levy assessment was exercised in the case before us before March and the denial was only afterwards This however does not determine the case in favour of the appellant as there is a question of equity to con sider and on which the appellant failed in the court below How far this representation was taken into consideration when <ORG> took possession of the site under the grant is not necessary to be considered at any great length It has nothing to do with any conduct on the part of the Corpora tion which can be said to have rendered the representation about non liability to assessment of no legal effect or consequence Can the Government be now allowed to go back on the representation and if we do so would it not amount to our countenancing the perpetration of what can be compendiously described as legal fraud which a court of equity must pre vent being committed If the resolution can be read as meaning that the grant was of rent free land the case would come strictly within the doctrine of estoppel enunciated in section of the Indian Evidence Act But even otherwise that is if there was merely the holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the future the Government must be deemed in the circumstances of this case to have bound themselves to fulfil it Whether it is the equity recognised in <NAME> case or it is some other form of equity is not of much importance Courts must do justice by the promotion of honesty and good faith as far as it lies in their power Here as pointed out already the <ORG> became the full and absolute owner of the site on the lapse of SO years from the date of the grant
