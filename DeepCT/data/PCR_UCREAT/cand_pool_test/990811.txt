This appeal is preferred by <ORG> against the judgment of <NAME> in A A of dismissing the appellant application to register his trade mark The appellant made an application for registration of a trade mark consisting of the word Asthmix in Part A of the Register in Class in respect of a designation of goods which after amendment read Pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of Asthma The Assistant Registrar of <ORG> found that there was a real tangible danger of confusion in the minds of the public In the result he dismissed the application with costs of the opponents On appeal by the appellant <NAME> while finding that the marks are admittedly not identical held that there was no visual similarity between the two competing marks and the phonetical test alone has to be applied to this case There is absolutely no similarity and no purchaser whether intelligent or unwary could mistake one medicine for the other The learned Judge also found that the marks are admittedly not identical and there is no visual similarity between the two competing marks We have no hesitation in accepting these findings and holding that there is no similarity whatsoever between the two products It was urged that the words are deceptively similar Section of the Act states that a mark the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion shall not be registered as a trade mark Section provides that save as provided in sub section no trade mark shall be registered in respect of any goods or description of gods which is identical with or deceptively similar to a trade mark which is already registered in the name of a different proprietor in respect of the same goods or description of goods The words deceptively similar are defined in Section as a mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion The main ground on which the Assistant Registrar whose opinion was accepted by the learned Judge refused to register the trade mark is that there is phonetical similarity At the first blush or on the first impression there could be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that there is no similarity There is no similarity in the goods by their look in the present case The learned Judge expressed the view that orders for the preparation of the drug asmac are placed over the telephone and are indistinctly heard over and that written prescriptions are mis spelt or badly written When a person authorised under the Act namely doctor nurse or a compounder deputed by the hospital or similar institutions goes to a pharmacy for buying the medicines it is presumed that he is sufficiently informed as not to mistake one medicine for the other when there is no similarity between the two drugs On a consideration of the entire facts of the case we are satisfied that there is no deceptive similarity between the two marks But in a case where the court is convinced that the Assistant Registrar is in error in refusing to register the trade mark on the ground that there is deceptive similarity between the two marks it is the duty of the court to interfere
