<NAME> the appellant in Criminal Appeal No of had obtained leave to appeal from <ORG> against the opinion of a Full Bench of that court in Criminal Revision No of by which it affirmed the order of the Civil and Sessions Judge of Sitapur in Criminal Revision No of holding that <NAME> was improperly discharged by the learned Magistrate of an offence under Section Indian Penal Code and directing the Magistrate to make a further inquiry into the matter of that offence The charge against him was that as a canal accountant in a Divisional Engineer office he committed criminal breach of trust of a certain sum of money His appeal to the Sessions Judge was dismissed on September and the revision to the Judicial Commissioner shared the same fate on January Special leave having been granted to him Criminal Appeal No of was the outcome Two other questions have also been urged before us and they are Assuming that there was no such implied repeal would the application of Section of the Indian Penal Code to a public servant infringe Article of the Constitution now that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the procedure laid down thereunder are available to deal with a breach of trust by a public servant and next if the appellants do not succeed on the first two points whether the provision for sanction required by the Prevention of Corruption Act would also similarly apply to a prosecution under Section of the Indian Penal Code The fasciculus of sections contained in Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code beginning with Section of the Indian Penal Code and ending with section of the Indian Penal Code deals with criminal breach of trust Section of the Indian Penal Code defines criminal breach of trust and Section of the Indian Penal Code is an aggravated form of criminal breach of trust when the same is committed by a public servant banker merchant etc Analysing Section of the Indian Penal Code into its component ingredients it is seen that the following essential ingredients are absolutely necessary to Attract the operation of the section i The accused must be entrusted with property or dominion over property ii The person so entrusted must a dishonestly misappropriate or convert to his own use that property or dishonestly use or dispose of that property or wilfully suffer any other person to do so in violation I of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or II of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust The duration of his piece of legislation in the first instance was only for a period of five years which later on was extended by Act II of for ten years which would mean that automatically the Act would expire by about the middle of Section lays down that offences under Sections and A of the Indian Penal Code which under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code were not cognizable are made cognizable It is not necessary to deal with these two sub clauses in detail because there is no question of any acceptance of illegal gratification in the present cases but one thing that has to be remembered is that these sub sections deal with habitual acceptance or obtaining etc As we are concerned with Section the same may be quoted in extenso If he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do Section lays down that if a public servant by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage he commits the offence Section makes the offence of criminal misconduct punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or with fine or with both It is clear therefore that where a person is charge with criminal misconduct and it is seen that he is in possession of property or income which could not have been amassed or earned by the official remuneration which he had obtained then the court is entitled to come to the conclusion that the amassing of such wealth was due to bribery or corruption and the person is guilty of an offence of criminal misconduct Whereas under Section Indian Penal Code as it stood before the recent amendment no accused person was entitled to be administered on oath and thereby competent to testify in a court of law in a case in which he is accused under Section any person charged with an offence punishable under Section or Section or A of the Indian Penal Code or under Sub section of Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act is a competent witness for the defence and may give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges made against him or any person charged together with him at the same trial and there are also certain safeguards provided in the matter of giving such testimony We have now referred to the relevant provision of Act II of in which the most important one for our present consideration is Section Then again there is a further fact under Section that if the public servant by corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abuses his position as a public servant and obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage then he will be guilty of the offence dishonestly using or disposing of that property or wilfully suffering any other person to do so in violation i of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or ii of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust The argument of the learned counsel for the appellants is that though the offences under the two provisions are indetical there are some advantages where the trial is under Section and certain disadvantages as well The advantages are The punishment for criminal mis conduct is less than the punishment for breach of trust by a public servant It is necessary to obtain previous sanction for a prosecution under Section whereas in the case of breach of trust by a public servant such sanction may or may not be necessary The investigation of an offence under Section slxould be by an officer of a higher grade though that does not obtain so far as the present appeals are concerned and The accused person has the right of giving evidence on his behalf Mr <NAME> strenuously urges that if there are two different statutes one enacted later than the other and if the later statute deals with the same subject matter the two cannot stand together and the earlier one being redundant or repugnant must be deemed to have been repealed The result is that whereas in this case there are penal statutes dealing with the same subject matter and the penalties and procedure prescribed by the statutes are different from each other then the later one must be taken to repeal or supersede the earlier The learned Judge after referring to the various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act came to the above conclusion After adverting to Section of the General Clauses Act and its counterpart Section of the Interpretation Act and also passages from <NAME> on Interpretation of Statutes the learned Judge was of opinion that it is not possible to infer that there was no implied repeal We now proceed to consider whether the two sections are identical in essence import and content and in our opinion the argument on behalf of the <ORG> carries much force when it is suggested that by enacting the Amending Act of and creating Sub section to Section the legislature specifically stated that the offence under Section is different from any previous existing offences under any penal statute and there can therefore be no scope for speculation about repeal Other law does not mean identical law in which case the word other will have no meaning There are three points of difference between Section of the Indian Penal Code and Section In Section of the Indian Penal Code the words used are In violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied There are no such expressions in Section It is clear therefore that whereas under Section of the Indian Penal Code there are three essential ingredients to constitute the offence each one of them being separate and distinct in Section there are only two Now considering Section there are certain matters in it which are absent in Section of the Indian Penal Code It may also mean that there is some kind of positive and tacit acquiescence necessary to bring home the offence There is an essential difference between allowing a person and wilfully suffering a person to do a certain thing Similarly there are a number of elements which can be proved in an inquiry or trial under Section that cannot be lei in by the prosecution when a person is charged for an offence under Section of the Indian Penal Code There is a vast difference between wilfully suffering another and allowing a person to do a particular thing and in our view the word allows is much wider in its import
