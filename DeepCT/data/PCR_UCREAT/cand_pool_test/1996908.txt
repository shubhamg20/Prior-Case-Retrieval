the petitioner therein challenged in a writ petition the levy of sales tax on the same grounds and <ORG> declared the notifications to be offensive to Art Following that decision the trial court decreed the suits filed by the appellants An enquiry into the diverse views expressed in the decisions of this Court shows that an exclusion of the jurisdiction of civil court is not readily to be inferred unless the following conditions apply Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals the civil court jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what the civil courts would normally do in a suit Such provision however does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the an examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted and whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not But the Bench observed that in such cases where the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred by providing an adequate machinery in the Act it becomes pertinent to enquire whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil court are prescribed by the statute or not and thus expressly left open the question as to how far the bar would operate in cases where the charging provision is ultra vires this Court upheld the order of refund by <ORG> in its writ jurisdiction held that in cases where a defence of limitation was open or other facts had to be decided the order of refund was not proper and accepted the proposition that a suit lay in such cases without adverting to the provisions of the Act to see whether the jurisdiction of civil court was barred either expressly or by necessary implication Therefore this case cannot be an authority for holding that the civil court has jurisdiction to entertain such suits Questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its constitutionality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act Since the tax authorities could not even proceed to assess the party their jurisdiction was affected and the case fell within categories and above and not in category The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> These are four appeals by certificate against the common judgment of <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh <ORG> December January dismissing four suits filed by the appellants to recover sales tax alleged to be realized illegally from them by the State of Madhya Pradesh the respondent in these appeals All these notifications imposed tax at different rates on tobacco above described on the importer that is to say at the point of import The tax was collected by the authorities in varying amounts from the appellants for different quarters of the Constitution on the ground that it was illegal to levy a tax on the importer when an equal tax was not levied on similar goods produced in the State Save as is provided in no assessment made and no order passed under this Act or the rules made thereunder by the assessing authority appellate authority or the Commissioner shall be called in question in any Court and save as is provided in sections and no appeal or application for revision shall lie against any such assessment or order How operates is perhaps best illustrated by referring to the categories of cases mentioned by <NAME> in <ORG> Hawkesford They are One is where there was a liability existing at common law and that liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law there unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy the party suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy The second class of cases is where the statute gives the right to sue merely but provides no particular form of remedy there the party can only proceed by action at common law But there is a third class viz where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it The remedy provided by the statute must be followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class To which category do such cases belong in India In the first case it was laid down by <ORG> that the ouster of the jurisdiction of <ORG> is not to be lightly inferred and can only be established if there is an express provision of law or is clearly implied In the second case it was held that where a liability to tax is created by statute which gives special and particular remedies against illegal exactions the remedy contemplated by the statute must be followed and it is not open to the assessee to pursue the ordinary process of Civil Courts To the latter case we shall refer in some detail presently The question is whether the relief of repayment has to be sought by the tax payer by an action in a civil court or whether such an order can be made by <ORG> in the exercise of its jurisdiction conferred by Art concluded that the High <ORG> had the power to order refund in proceedings for a writ since complete relief could not be said to be given if only a declaration were given The <ORG> however observed At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact that the special remedy provided in Article is not intended to supersede completely the modes of obtaining relief by an action in a civil court or to deny defences legitimately open in such actions Therefore in those cases there were appeals before this Court where the writ was asked for within three years this Court upheld the order of refund by <ORG> in its writ jurisdiction but in those cases in which the parties had gone to <ORG> after a lapse of years the order of refund was questioned and not approved observing that the petitioners would be at liberty to seek such relief as they might be entitled to in <ORG> if it was not barred by limitation The case cannot therefore be treated as an authority to hold that <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain such suits We may now proceed to consider first the two cases of <ORG> before examining the position under the rulings of this Court of the Land <ORG> Act provided inter alia Every order passed in appeal under this section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by be final It is also well settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded <ORG>s have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure Then it proceeded to quote as above and observed By Ss and a precise and self contained code of appeal is provided in regard to obligation which are created by the statute itself and it enables the appeal to be carried to the supreme head of the executive Government This was an appeal to <ORG> from a judgment of <ORG> in civil appellate jurisdiction reversing a decree passed by a Special Bench of <ORG> in its original civil jurisdiction It arose from a suit filed for recovery of a sum paid under protest pursuant to an assessment to income tax of <ORG> on the ground that the computation was under a provision of the Income Tax Act which was ultra vires <ORG> <ORG> was of the opinion that barred the jurisdiction The argument was that the assessment was not one under the Act if effect was given to an ultra vires provision since the provision would be a nullity and non existent To discover the force of the prohibition in the following tests were applied a Does the Act contain machinery by which the assessee can raise the question of the vires of the provision before the special authorities This test was not conclusive but one to be considered <ORG> however came to the conclusion that the Income tax Act gave the assessee an opportunity to raise the question under the Income tax Act There was no difference between an incorrect apprehension of the provisions of the Income tax Act and the invalidity of a provision The presence of a section barring the jurisdiction was the main reason and the existence of an adequate machinery for the same relief was the supplementary reason <ORG> had jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act had not been complied with or the statutory tribunal had not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedures A passage from the latter case might be quoted here It is true that even if the jurisdiction of the civil court is excluded where the provisions of the statute have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine these cases It follows that the question of validity of the taxing laws is always open to <ORG> for it cannot be the implication of any provision to make such a decision final or that even void or invalid laws must be enforced without any remedy It was held that since the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act were declared ultra vires in their application to indivisible works contracts the action of the authorities was outside the said Act and not under the Act for the purposes of A No doubt the power to make an assessment was conferred by the Act and therefore making an assessment would be within the jurisdiction of the assessing authoririty Having considered these rulings the learned Judge examined the remedies provided by the Indian Income tax Act and found that all authorities were creatures of the statute and functioned under it and could not ignore its provisions since the said Act conferred no such right on them Pointing out that the reference to <ORG> under the Indian Income tax Act was confined to questions arising from the order of <ORG> the learned Judge observed that the question of ultra vires is foreign to the scope of the <ORG> jurisdiction and that if such a question were raised the <ORG> could only reject it on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to decide it and <ORG> and <ORG> would be equally incompetent on appeal to go into the question The learned Judge next considered the decisions of <ORG>s into which it is not necessary to go here and on the strength of some observations which supported his view stated his view in the following words The legal position that emerges from the discussion may be summarized thus If a statute imposes a liability and creates an effective machinery for deciding questions of law or fact arising in regard to that liability it may by necessary implication bar the maintainability of a civil suit in respect of the said liability But an authority created by a statute cannot question the vires of that statute or any of the provisions thereof where under it functions In that event a suit to question the validity of such an order made outside the Act would certainly lie in a civil court There was at that time no provision to oust the jurisdiction of the civil courts The only provision which had to be considered was which provided every order passed in appeal under this section shall subject to the powers of revision conferred by be final In the case of this <ORG> last cited the following observation was made It is necessary to add that these observations though made in somewhat wide terms do not justify the assumption that if a decision has been made by a taxing authority under the provisions of the relevant taxing statute its validity can be challenged by a suit on the ground that it is incorrect on the merits and as such it can be claimed that the provisions of the said statute have not been complied with Non compliance with the provi sions of the statute to which reference is made by <ORG> must we think be non compliance with such fundamental provisions of the statute as would make the entire proceedings before the appropriate authority illegal and without jurisdiction Similarly if an appropriate authority has acted in violation of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure that may also tend to make the proceedings illegal and void and this infirmity may affect the validity of the order passed by the authority in question The argument of exemption was rejected by observing There was in the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Act at the material time no express provision which obliged the taxing authority to exclude from the computation of taxable turnover the amount of salestax collected by the dealers This Court first held that there was no provision in the said Act for bringing a civil suit to question the assessment This Court analysed the provisions of the said Act which provided by A and for special appeals including an appeal to <ORG> the highest <ORG> in the State laying down further that the appeal should be heard by <ORG> lm In what cases such a plea would succeed it is unnecessary for us to decide in the present appeal because we have no doubt that the contention of the appellant that on the merits the decision of the assessing authority was wrong cannot be the subject matter of a suit because A clearly bars such a claim in the civil courts This brings us to the last case on the subject Save as is provided in no assessment made and no order passed under this Act or the rules made thereunder by the Commissioner or any person appointed under to assist him shall be called into question in <ORG> and save as it provided in sections and no appeal or application for revision shall lie against any such assessment or order This Court held that as there was adequate remedy to raise the question before the authorities by asking for rectification of the assessment the section could not be said to deprive him of remedy in such a way as to render the section itself unconstitutional as was hinted in <ORG> case about of the Indian Income tax Act If it appears that a statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right and liability to be dealt with by tribunals specially constituted in that behalf and it further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted it becomes pertinent to enquire whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not The result of this inquiry into the diverse views expressed in this Court may be stated as follows Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals <ORG> jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what <ORG> would normally do in a suit Such provision however does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court an examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all ques tions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted and whether remedies normally associated with actions in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statute or not the decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act These sub sections laid the tax on dealers according to their tax able turnover and in the case of a dealer who imported goods into Madhya Bharat the taxable turnover was Rs Section made certain exclusions and exemptions and section prescribed the rate of tax As the import itself postulated movement of goods the matter fell within Article and as trade and commerce is declared to be free throughout the territory of India it became unfree by reason of the tax That required that similar goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat had to bear an equal tax It was directly covered by the decision of this Court in <NAME> case read with <ORG> <ORG> and <NAME> case already referred to We would have considered this matter again if <NAME> case had been doubted before but it seems to have been followed in the last mentioned case and <ORG> case If <ORG> case had not expressly left the question open we would have applied the earlier case of <ORG> but as it is we are bound not by <ORG> decision but by <NAME> case We must therefore allow these appeals with costs
