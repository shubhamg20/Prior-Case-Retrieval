The appellant herein obtained a decree in ejectment against the respondent in respect of a shop belonging to the appellant which had been leased to the respondent An ex parte decree in ejectment was passed by the District Munsiff on the th September and the property was delivered over to the appellant in execution proceedings on th September but the execution application was not formally closed The District Munsiff held upholding the contention of the respondent that under Section of the amended Non Residential Building Rent Control Order a tenant could not be evicted and accordingly held that the previous order directing delivery was wrong and the Court had jurisdiction to set aside that order and to order re delivery as the execution petition had not been closed and the proceedings were still pending before the Court The learned Subordinate Judge agreed with the view of the learned District Munsiff and held that Section of the Control Order ousted the jurisdiction of <ORG> to give delivery of the shop in spite of the fact that a decree for eviction had already been passed in respect of the same The appeal was dismissed by him and this civil miscellaneous second appeal is against the said order It is contended before me for the appellant that as the suit had been instituted prior to th July the provisions of Section Clauses and of the amended Control Order which came into force on nth July should not be applied but that on the other hand the law to be administered is the law as it was in force when the suit was instituted It was held by the learned Judge that there was no indication in the amended Control Order that the terms thereof should be construed to operate retrospectively so as to affect the rights of persons in pending litigation at the time when the amendment came into force He overruled the contention that the new Section and merely affected the procedure of the <ORG> and not any substantive rights of parties He expressly dissented from the obiter dictum of <NAME> in an earlier case which took a different view In the particular case before me the suit was instituted much earlier than th July and the landlord had apparently a good title to get a decree in ejectment as there was nothing to indicate that the tenant had obtained any rights under the provisions of the previous Control Order then in force If there had been no amendment in the interval the landlord who had a right to obtain an executable decree in ejectment when the suit was instituted could have taken out execution proceedings and obtained delivery of possession from the tenant in due course of execution of the decree which he had obtained in the suit Such a right could not be a mere matter of procedure which could be taken away by the amended provisions of the new Order unless there is any clear indication that the amended Order should apply so as to take away even existing rights of a substantive character rights which had accrued prior to the coming into force of the new amendment and indeed rights for the enforcement of which an action had been instituted in <ORG> It is however possible to give a meaning to these words without necessarily construing the section as taking away the rights of parties in an action instituted before the amendment came into force It must now be taken to be well settled that a decree in ejectment could be passed by <ORG> and all that the Order provides is that during the subsistence of the Order <ORG> cannot execute the said decree but the landlord will have to take appropriate steps under the provisions of the Order The Order itself is only for a short duration and if and when it is repealed or it expires without being renewed the previous decree of <ORG> will have to be executed by <ORG> as in ordinary cases If therefore it is possible to give a meaning and scope for operation for the words in execution of a decree or otherwise in Section by confining it to cases where the decree is obtained in a suit instituted after th July and if there is nothing else in the enactment to indicate that every pending legislation or pre existing substantive rights of parties were intended to be affected by the amended Order I must hold in accordance with the well established rules of construction of statutes that the amended Control Order Section Clauses and has no application to the present execution petition and that the order for delivery originally made was right and proper <NAME> points out that unless either expressly or by necessary intendment it is made out in the new legislation that it applies to pending proceedings as well it ought not to be construed to have retrospective operation so as to affect the rights of parties in pending suits In the result this appeal is allowed with costs throughout
