We are here dealing only with a limited question relating mainly to seniority of the reserved candidates promoted at roster points We also make it clear that what we are deciding today is based on principles already laid down by this Court since and in particular since In <NAME> the Court said the balance must be maintained in such a manner that there was no reverse discrimination against the general candidates and that any rule circular or order which gave seniority to the reserved candidates promoted at roster point would be violative of Articles and of the Constitution of India The Indian <ORG> following the law laid down in <NAME> issued a circular on to the effect that the reserved candidates promoted at roster points could not claim seniority over the senior general candidates promoted later According to the learned counsel the roster point promotees i a reserved candidate at Level who is promoted to Level at the roster point meant for such promotion namely the reserved candidates cannot claim seniority on the basis of continuous officiation Senior counsel <NAME> and others for the general candidates contended that <NAME> and <NAME> were correctly decided and <NAME> was wrongly decided and unless there was a vacancy generated at the points already filled fresh candidates from the reserved candidates could not be promoted by further operation of the roster Assume that a reserved candidate has been promoted from Level to Level on the basis of the roster point and again from Level to Level on roster point Ignoring the senior general candidate at Level the reserved candidate has been further promoted to Level before when <NAME> was decided At Level when the general candidate is also promoted to Level the seniority of the reserved candidate has also to be fixed on the basis as to when he would have otherwise been promoted to Level after considering the case of his senior general candidate at Level We shall be dealing with these main contentions in this judgment So far as the individual points raised in the Civil Appeals Contempt Cases and other IAs are concerned we shall deal with them by separate judgments for convenience On the above contentions the following four main points arise for consideration Points Can the roster point promotees reserved category count their seniority in the promoted category from the date of their continuous officiation vis a vis general candidates who were senior to them in the lower category and who were later promoted to the same level Have <NAME> <NAME> been correctly decided and has <NAME> been correctly decided Whether the catch up principles contended for by the general candidates are tenable What is the meaning of the prospective operation of <ORG> and to what extent can <NAME> be prospective Learned counsel submitted that it was their contention that this amendment was not constitutionally permissible but this question need not be decided in this batch as separate writ petitions challenging the validity of Article A are pending in this <ORG> In view of the above stand we shall proceed in these cases on the assumption that Article A is valid and is not unconstitutional Sub clauses and A of Article which have relevance in this case read as follows Article Equality of appointment in matters of public employment There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of appointment or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> A Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion of any class or classes of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> Constitution is not static We shall at the outset deal with the contention raised by Sri <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the reserved candidates that Article must be interpreted keeping in mind the conditions prevailing fifty years ago when the Constitution was drafted and when Article was incorporated in the Constitution Learned counsel submitted that the founding fathers were conscious that a special provision for reservation was necessary to see that the backward classes of citizens were adequately represented in the services However we must bear in mind and not ignore that there are other provisions namely Articles and Article of the Constitution which are also very important While permitting reservations at the same time it has also placed certain limitations by way of Articles and so that there is no reverse discrimination In <NAME> Vs Maryland Wheel Chief Justice <NAME> cautioned that we must keep in mind that it is the Constitution that we are expounding They deal with individual rights of the person Article demands that the <ORG> shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws Article issues a positive command that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in the matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> It has been held repeatedly by this Court that sub clause of Article is a facet of Article and that it takes its roots from Article The word employment being wider there is no dispute that it takes within its fold the aspect of promotions to posts above the stage of initial level of recruitment Article provides to every employee otherwise eligible for promotion or who comes within the zone of consideration a fundamental right to be considered for promotion Equal opportunity here means the right to be considered for promotion If a person satisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but is not considered for promotion then there will be a clear infraction of his fundamental right to be considered for promotion which is his personal right That is how right to be considered for promotion and the seniority attached to such promotion become important facets of the fundamental right guaranteed in Article Right to be considered for promotion is not a mere statutory right The question is as to whether the right to be considered for promotion is a mere statutory right or a fundamental right Such a view has also been expressed in <NAME> and some other latter cases where these cases have been followed Article read with Articles and guarantees a right to promotion to Dalits and Tribes as a fundamental right where they do not have adequate representation consistently with the efficiency of administration before expiry thereof i years rule Article has come into force from In the above passage it was laid down that promotion was a statutory right and that Articles and A conferred fundamental rights In our opinion the above view expressed in <NAME> and followed in <NAME> and other cases if it is intended to lay down that the right guaranteed to employees for being considered for promotion according to relevant rules of recruitment by promotion i whether on basis of seniority or merit is only a statutory right and not a fundamental right we cannot accept the proposition We have already stated earlier that the right to equal opportunity in the matter of promotion in the sense of a right to be considered for promotion is indeed a fundamental right guaranteed under Article and this has never been doubted in any other case before <NAME> right from Articles and A do not confer any fundamental right to reservation We next come to the question whether Article and Article A guaranteed any fundamental right to reservation It should be noted that both these Articles open with a non obstante clause Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation There is a marked difference in the language employed in Article on the one hand and Article and Article A On the face of it the above language in each of Articles and A is in the nature of an enabling provision and it has been so held in judgments rendered by Constitution Benches and in other cases right from It was clearly laid down by the five Judge Bench that Article was only an enabling provision that Article was not a fundamental right and that it did not impose any constitutional duty It only conferred a discretion on the <ORG> The passage in the above case reads as follows Our conclusion therefore is that Article does not confer any right on the petitioner and there is no constitutional duty imposed on the government to make reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes either at the initial stage or at the stage of promotion In other words Article is an enabling provision and confers discretionary power on the <ORG> to make a reservation of appointment in favour of backward class of citizens which in its opinion is not adequately represented in the services of the <ORG> In view of the overwhelming authority right from we hold that both Articles and A do not confer any fundamental rights nor do they impose any constitutional duties but are only in the nature of enabling provision vesting a discretion in the <ORG> to consider providing reservation if the circumstances mentioned in those Articles so warranted Power is coupled with duty Learned senior counsel for the reserved candidates <NAME> however contended that Article and Article A confer a power coupled with a duty and that it would be permissible to enforce such a duty by issuing a writ of mandamus We also note that in Superintending Engineer Public Health Vs <NAME> SCC <NAME> case was followed and reference was made to Article and Article A and to the principle that where a power is coupled with a duty as in <NAME> Vs Lord <NAME> and Commissioner of Police Vs <NAME> the same could be enforced by the <ORG> But we may point out that even in <NAME> case no reference was made to <NAME> and other cases Balancing of fundamental rights under Article and the rights of reserved candidates under Articles and A Having noticed that Article deals with a fundamental right and Article and Article A are enabling provisions we next come to the need for balancing Article and Articles and A SCR wherein it was stated that the interests of the reserved classes must be balanced against the interests of other segments of society In <NAME> case <NAME> explained how the fundamental right of the citizens as declared in Article has to be balanced against the claims of the reserved candidates in Article The provision under Article conceived in the interests of certain sections of society should be balanced against the guarantee of equality enshrined in clause of Article which is a guarantee held out to every citizen and to the entire society In that case it was stated that while dealing with the affirmative action taken in favour of African Americans the Equal Protection Clause which conferred individual rights have to be kept in mind by the <ORG> The rights established are personal rights <NAME> Vs <NAME> The same learned Judge Justice <NAME> stated again recently in <ORG> Vs <NAME> that in such matters relating to affirmative action the <ORG> would launch an inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed Thus this Court has to ensure that in matters relating to affirmative action by the <ORG> the rights under Articles and of the individual to equality of opportunity are not affected A reasonable balance has to be struck so that the affirmative action does not lead to reverse discrimination also cautioned in <ORG> Vs <ORG> SCC at that care must be taken to see that classification is not pushed to such an extreme point as to make the fundamental right to equality cave in and collapse It is provided in proviso iii to Rule that all promotions shall be made by selection on the basis of seniority cum merit and no person shall have a right of promotion on the basis of seniority alone There is reservation only in Class III posts by way of roster at two stages It is not permissible to delink the seniority Rule from the recruitment Rule based on equal opportunity and apply it to promotions made on the basis of the roster which promotions are made out side the equal opportunity principle But if reserved category candidate is otherwise eligible and posts are available for promotion to Level they cannot be denied right to be considered for promotion to Level merely because erstwhile seniors at the entry levels have not reached Level In that case <NAME> observed It also cannot be overlooked that for the first promotion from the basic grade there was no occasion to examine their merit and suitability for promotion As we would presently show in <NAME> the seniority rule which referred to continuous officiation and which applied to promotions made after providing equal opportunity as per rules was delinked from the promotion rule and applied to roster promotees which in our view was the main reason for arriving at a different result Rule stated that all promotions would have to be made by selection based on merit and taking into consideration seniority but seniority alone would not give any right to such promotions Rule provided that seniority would be counted from the date of continuous officiation The <ORG> held in <NAME> that the roster promotees who were promoted to Level could count their seniority from the date of continuous officiation in that level in view of Rule From the level beyond Level the posts were Superintendent Budget Officer Assistant Registrar and Registrar and were governed by <ORG> State Service Group Rule and there was no reservation In those Rules also Rule stated that all promotions would have to be made by selection based on merit and taking into consideration seniority but seniority alone was not to give any right to such promotion Rule of the Rules also stated that seniority would count from the dates of continuous officiation For the reasons given already in regard to <NAME> we hold that <NAME> arrived at an incorrect conclusion because of applying a rule of continuous officiation which was not intended to apply to the reserved candidates promoted at roster points The various rulings relied upon in Jagdishlal do not in our opinion support the conclusions arrived at in that case It must be noticed that those cases arose under the <ORG>s Reorganisation Act where the words conditions of service were used in Section of that Act It was in that context that it was held that mere chances of promotions were not conditions of service and there was no question of seeking the sanction of <ORG> if chances of promotion were affected after allotment to a new <ORG> In fact <ORG> had issued orders under Section that various other conditions of service in the parent <ORG> like salary leave etc SCC no doubt said that there was no right to promotion but even that case accepted that there was a right to be considered for promotion That case in our view was correctly decided on facts because by the date the general candidate reached the higher category the reserved category promotee who reached that category earlier had got a further promotion That case in our view has also no application Observations in <NAME> which run contrary to <NAME> <NAME> do not lay down correct law We may state that there are various other observations made in <NAME> and we find that they run counter to the principles laid down by the nine Judge Bench in <NAME> and <ORG> in <NAME> It was argued by <NAME> that it was one thing to say that it was open to the <ORG> to deprive the roster promotee of the benefit of such seniority from the date of roster promotion but it was another thing to say that even if the <ORG> thought fit to give benefit of seniority on the basis of roster promotion the same should be tested on the anvil of Article and of the Constitution of India Thus it was argued that <NAME> went far beyond <NAME> when it held that any circular order or rule granting seniority to the roster promotee would be violative of Article and of the Constitution of India That brings us to a close examination of the main principle laid down in <NAME> and in <NAME> We have examined <ORG> closely in the light of the above objection Learned Additional Solicitor General Sri <NAME> attempted to argue that what the <ORG> said in para was wrong as it assumed that seniority at Level would get reflected in the levels higher up and what is stated in para in regard to one previous panel having priority over a later panel would apply in all cases even to <ORG>s referred to in paras We are satisfied that there is no factual mistake committed in the judgment in <ORG> We shall refer to these IAs again in our separate judgment relating to individual cases Did <NAME> go beyond <ORG> and if so was it correctly decided We now deal with the points raised by the reserved candidates against the correctness of <NAME> It was urged by learned senior counsel <NAME> that <NAME> went far beyond <ORG> But according to learned senior counsel <NAME> in <NAME> this Court went further and stated that any rule circular or order which gave seniority to the roster point promotees was bad and that this view is not correct Our attention is invited to SCC at as follows According to us this question cannot be examined only on the basis of any circular order or rule issued or framed by <ORG> or the Union of India In our opinion there is no conflict in the principles laid down in these two judgments nor is there anything wrong in the above elucidation of the law In Virpal it was not necessary for the Court to go into the question whether any circular if it gave seniority to the roster point promotees reserved candidates could be treated as valid That was why in <NAME> this Court had to consider the validity of such a Circular In <NAME> this Court held that the declaration granted in the impugned judgment of the <ORG> in <NAME> on the basis of the Punjab circular would be in conflict with Article and Article It was the contention of the direct recruits respondents that here again the seniority should be alternated between direct recruits and promotees as done at the basic level though there was no such rule For fixing seniority at Level there is no question of placing direct recruits and promotees alternatively To what extent <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> cases help the reserved candidates In <NAME> case decided by a three Judge Bench there was a circular issued by <ORG> providing for the first time reservation in promotional posts There are indeed certain observations that seniority of the reserved candidate had to be counted from the date of regular promotion which in our opinion are not correct There are two aspects of this decision On the other hand the senior general candidate at the lower level if he reaches the promotional level later but before the further promotion of the reserved candidate he will have to be treated as senior at the promotional level to the reserved candidate even if the reserved candidate was earlier promoted to that level We also hold that <NAME> and <NAME> have been correctly decided and that <NAME> is not correctly decided Point During the discussion under this catch up point for purposes of convenience we take the example of the cadres in <NAME> i there is roster point promotion for reserved candidates for promotion from Level to Level and from Level to Level In cases where the reserved candidate has gone upto Level ignoring the seniority of the senior general candidate at Level seniority at Level has to be refixed when the senior general candidate is promoted to Level on the basis of when the time of reserved candidate for promotion to Level would have come if the case of the senior general candidates was considered at Level in due time Such a procedure in our view will properly balance the rights of the reserved candidates and the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article to the general candidates Examples given by reserved candidates do not create any anomaly Learned senior counsel <NAME> and <NAME> then adverted to a situation which according to them might create serious problems if a senior general candidate is to be treated as senior at the promotional level if he reaches that level before the roster promotee goes further up The example given refer to cases where after the roster point promotee reserved candidate reaches the promotional level there is direct recruitment or recruitment by transfer at that promotional level The direct recruit or transferee who has no grievance against the reserved candidate who was already there can have no grievance against a senior general candidate who has a superior claim in law against the reserved candidate Even if seniority of roster point promotee does not Count experience of both groups can be considered as part of merit for further promotion Before we leave point we may refer to another submission made by <NAME> learned senior counsel for the reserved candidates This Court in <NAME> therefore tried to prevent such reversions and declared of SCC Para as follows at the end of the judgment We however direct that the interpretation given by us to the working of the roster and our findings on this point shall be operative prospectively ii The rival contentions To the extent of saving the reversions of those from reserved classes promoted before though such promotions were made contrary to what was decided in <NAME> there is no serious dispute from the side of the general candidates but a contention is raised by the reserved candidates who got such promotions in excess of the reservation quota that they should in addition get the benefit of the seniority in the promotional post even if such promotion made before was wrong in view of what was decided in <NAME> We have accepted while dealing with Points and that the reserved candidates who get promoted at two levels by roster points say from Level to Level and level to level cannot count their seniority at Level as against senior general candidates who reached Level before the reserved candidates moved upto Level Where before i the date of <NAME> judgment at the level there were reserved candidates who reached there earlier and also senior general candidates who reached there later but before the reserved candidate was promoted to level and when in spite of the fact that the senior general candidate had to be treated as senior at level in view of <NAME> the reserved candidate is further promoted to level without considering the fact that the senior general candidate was also available at level then after it becomes necessary to review the promotion of the reserved candidate to level and reconsider the same without causing reversion to the reserved candidate who reached level before As and when the senior reserved candidate is later promoted to level the seniority at level has also to be refixed on the basis of when the reserved candidate at level would have got his normal promotion treating him as junior to the senior general candidate at level We hold accordingly on Point
