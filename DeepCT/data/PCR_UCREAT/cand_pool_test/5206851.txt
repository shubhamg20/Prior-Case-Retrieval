The first defendant filed the above application to reject the plaint on the ground that the suit filed by the respondent plaintiff is barred by law and is also barred by limitation It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant first defendant that as per the averment in the plaint the first respondent plaintiff admitted that the tenancy between the applicant first defendant and the respondent plaintiff was determined by the issuance of notice dated and thereafter the respondent plaintiff filed No of before the VI Assistant City Civil <ORG> Chennai for eviction of the applicant from the suit property and in that suit the applicant first defendant filed I A No of under Section of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act for purchasing the suit property and thereafter the suit was dismissed for non prosecution by order dated and consequentially I A No of filed by the first defendant was also dismissed for default As the tenancy was terminated as early as on and the respondent plaintiff filed the suit No of for recovery of possession and that was allowed to be dismissed for default the present suit for recovery of possession and for damages is clearly barred by law under Order Rule of the CPC and also under Article of the Limitation Act He therefore contended that under Article of the Limitation Act as between the landlord and tenant when the tenancy is determined the suit for recovery of possession ought to have been filed within years from the date of determination of tenancy and in this case tenancy was terminated by issuance of notice dated and the suit was filed only on after a period of years from the date of termination of tenancy and therefore the present suit is barred under Article of the Limitation Act He also submitted that it is admitted that the respondent plaintiff filed No of for eviction against the same defendants and that the suit was dismissed for default and therefore the present suit without obtaining leave of the <ORG> in the earlier suit is not maintainable and is also barred under Order Rule of CPC and Order Rule of CPC The learned counsel relied upon the following judgments in support of his contention that the suit is barred by limitation by virtue of Article of the Limitation Act He also relied upon the following judgment reported in MLJ in the matter of <ORG> and Others in support of his contention that without getting liberty while withdrawing the earlier suit the second suit on the same subject matter and on the same cause of action is not maintainable He also relied upon the judgment reported in MLJ in the matter of <NAME> and another Versus District Collector cum Accommodation Controller Chennai and others in support of his contention that the suit is liable to be rejected as it amounts to re litigation and abuse of process of <ORG> and having realised that Section application filed by the application was allowed the respondent plaintiff allowed the suit to be dismissed for default and consequentially the application filed under Section was also dismissed and therefore it is a clear case of re litigation and abuse of process of <ORG> On the other hand the learned counsel for the first respondent plaintiff submitted that the law of limitation is a mixed question of fact and law without framing any issue as to whether the suit is barred by limitation and without letting in evidence the Court cannot reject the plaint and therefore the rejection of the plaint sought for by the applicant first defendant on the ground of limitation is not maintainable He also submitted that even though the tenancy was determined by issuance of notice dated by virtue of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act the applicant continues to be the tenant and in that capacity only the applicant filed the application under Section of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act in I A No of in No of and in that application order was passed permitting the applicant first defendant to purchase the portion in its occupation and the first respondent also agreed to sell the property to the applicant for a consideration of Rs per ground and thereafter the applicant did not exercise the option and was sending erstwhile rent of Rs per month and therefore in the respondent plaintiff was advised not to proceed with the suit and therefore he did not prosecute the suit and the suit was dismissed for default on and I A No of was also dismissed He also relied upon the judgment reported in <ORG> in the matter of <ORG> vs <ORG> and others in support of his contention that the suit cannot be dismissed as barred by law of limitation without proper pleading framing of issue of limitation and taking of evidence He also submitted that the earlier suit No of was dismissed for default as evidenced by Document No and it was wrongly mentioned in the plaint that it was allowed to be dismissed as withdrawn He therefore submitted that under Order Rule when a suit was allowed to be dismissed for default either the plaintiff can file an application to set aside the dismissal and restore the suit or file a fresh suit subject to law of limitation and on the same cause of action and there is no need to apply for leave for filing a fresh suit He therefore submitted that the respondent plaintiff has chosen to file a fresh suit for recovery of possession and therefore it cannot be stated that the suit is barred under Order Rule or Order Rule and as leave was not obtained before the withdrawal of the suit so as to enable the plaintiff to file a fresh suit on the same cause of action It is also settled that law of limitation is a mixed question of law and fact and therefore when the pleading in the plaint makes it clear that the suit is barred by limitation the suit can be rejected on the ground of limitation and when there are allegations in the plaint which require a roving enquiry to give a finding whether the suit is barred by limitation and in that context the <ORG> should not conduct a roving enquiry to find out whether the suit is barred by limitation Bearing these principles in mind we shall see whether the allegations made in the plaint make out a case that the suit is barred by limitation But earlier to termination notice was issued by the respondent on calling upon the applicant to deliver vacant possession on Therefore in these circumstances it cannot be stated that the suit is barred by limitation under Article of the Limitation Act on the ground that the tenancy was terminated by issuance of notice dated and the present suit was filed only on after more than years In the Judgment reported in MLJ SC supra <ORG> held that the averments made in the plaint as a whole have to be seen to find out whether Order VII Rule is applicable The question of relitigation arises when an issue was decided in the earlier suit and a finding was rendered on that issue and thereafter another suit cannot be filed on the same issue Therefore we will have to find out whether on the basis of the allegations made in the plaint whether the suit is barred by limitation In the judgment reported in Supreme Court Cases supra the character of a tenancy after the termination of tenancy having regard to the Rent Control Legislation was discussed and <ORG> followed the earlier judgment reported in SCC supra held that the term statutory tenant as used in English Rent Act has been used by the Indian Courts to denote a tenant whose contractual tenancy has been terminated but who has become entitled to continue to remain in possession by virtue of the protection afforded to him by the statutes in question namely the various Rent Control Acts prevailing in different States of India It is held that the termination of contractual tenancy does not bring any change in the status and position of the tenant unless there are contrary provisions in the statute It is also held that the distinction between the contractual tenancy and statutory tenancy is completely obliterated by the Rent Control Legislation and though genetically the parentage of these two legal concepts is different they are equated with each other and their incidents are the same As stated supra it is the contention of the first respondent plaintiff that though the tenancy was terminated by issuance of a notice dated admittedly the tenant filed an Application under Section of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act claiming status of the tenant in the suit filed by the first respondent plaintiff Though such specific pleading was not made in the plaint as now contended by the learned counsel for the first respondent plaintiff it is stated in the plaint that the applicant first defendant was sending the amount which was paid earlier and he also filed an Application under Section of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act and that Application was allowed and he failed to purchase the property even though the same was offered by the first respondent plaintiff it was observed in paragraphs and as follows At the same time it should be borne in mind that no pedantic approach should be adopted to defeat justice on hair splitting technicalities Disputed questions cannot be decided at the time of considering an application filed under Order Rule CPC Clause of Rule of Order applies in those cases only where the statement made by the plaintiff in the plaint without any doubt or dispute shows that the suit is barred by any law in force The principle is therefore well settled that in order to examine whether the plaint is barred by any law as contemplated by clause of Order Rule CPC the averments made in the plaint alone have to be seen and they have to be assumed to be correct Hence the plaint cannot be rejected under Order Rule of on the ground that the suit is barred by limitation Therefore having regard to the fact whether the applicant first defendant has become a statutory tenant by virtue of provisions of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act and also the fact that the applicant first defendant invoked Section of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act to treat him as tenant and was also paying the rent of Rs even after the determination of tenancy and having regard to the definition of tenant under Section of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act it cannot be decided at this stage without framing any issue as to whether the applicant first defendant is in possession of the property as statutory tenant as alleged by it or a trespasser as alleged by the first respondent plaintiff and whether Article of the Limitation Act would apply to the facts of the case and all these are mixed question of fact and law which cannot be decided while deciding the petition under Order Rule of <ORG> to reject the plaint on the ground of limitation Admittedly the earlier suit in No of was allowed to be dismissed for default and therefore under Order Rule option is given to the plaintiff either to file a fresh suit subject to law of limitation or to file an Application to set aside the dismissal and to restore the suit Therefore there is no need to obtain liberty before instituting a fresh suit in such circumstances Therefore the argument of the learned counsel for the applicant that the suit is barred by Order Rule or suit is not maintainable as no liberty was obtained for filing a fresh suit cannot be entertained
