Vs RESPONDENT THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX MADRAS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH AGRAWAL PATTANAIK ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT PATTANAIK These two appeals by special leave at the instance of the assessee are directed against the order of <ORG> answering the question posed in favour of the revenue and against the assessee <ORG> Madras Bench referred the following question to <ORG> for its opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that of the amount paid by the assessee as royalty to Messrs Jonas Woodhead Sons The assessee a limited company incorporated in March to carry on the business of manufacture of automobiles springs entered into an agreement with <ORG> hereinafter referred to as foreign company of United Kingdom for manufacture of all types of springs and suspension for road and rail vehicles The said agreement between the parties also provide that in consideration of the information to be furnished and services to be rendered to the assessee by the foreign firm the assessee shall pay a royalty at the rates of the licensed products turnover of the assessee to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the agreement The production of the assessee commenced on and in terms of the agreement the assessee made payments of Rs The assessee preferred appeals before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and being unsuccessful therein preferred second appeal to <ORG> The <ORG> having dismissed the second appeal an application was filled by the assessee under Section of the Income tax Act for referring the question of law as already indicated to <ORG> for being answered In answering the question posed in favour of the revenue <ORG> considered the different clauses of the agreement between the parties and is of the opinion that the assessee acquired a benefit of enduring nature which will constitute acquisition of an asset and amount paid for the same would constitute capital expenditure Mrs <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that <ORG> was in error in answering the question in favour of the revenue on a finding that the payment was made to the foreign company for obtaining advantage of enduring benefit in as much as it does not offer advantage of enduring nature acquired by an assessee which could be held to be a capital expenditure According to the learned counsel the payments made by the assessee to the foreign firm for the technical know how and assistance rendered by the said foreign firm enabled the assessee to carry on its business more efficiently and more profitably leaving fixed capital untouched and therefore the said payment or any part of it cannot be held to be a capital expenditure The learned counsel places reliance on the decision of <ORG> reported in ITR The learned counsel also urged that the payment required to be made by the assessee to the foreign firm was merely for the better conduct and improvement of the existing business and as such was revenue in nature and can held to be a capital expenditure Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for the revenue on the other hand contended that the question whether a particular payment made by the assessee would form a part of revenue expenditure or capital expenditure would depend upon the relevant facts and the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties under which the payment is made According to the learned counsel the various clauses of the agreement having been analysed and the <ORG> having found that the foreign firm not merely provided the technical know how for manufacturing the product but also gave plan and designs and established the factory for manufacture of the products and the business concerned being totally new business and even after the conclusion of the agreement period the assessee was required merely to return the plans and designs but there was no embargo on the assessee to manufacture the product in question and the payments under the agreement being of a composite nature the <ORG> was fully justified in holding the part of the payments made by the assessee did form the capital expenditure and <ORG> was wholly justified in answering the reference in favour of the revenue The question whether a particular payment made by an assessee under the terms of the agreement forms a part of capital expenditure or revenue expenditure would depend upon several factors namely whether the assessee obtained a completely new plan with a complete new process and completely new technology for manufacture of the product or the payments was made for the technical know how which was for the betterment of the product in question which was already being produced whether the improvisation made is the part and parcel of the existing business or a new business was set up with the so called technical know how for which payments were made whether on expiry of the period of agreement the assessee is required to give back the plans and designs which were obtained but the assessee could manufacture the product in the factory that has been set up with the collaboration of the foreign firm the cumulative effect on a construction of the various terms and conditions of the agreement whether the assessee derived benefits coming to its capital for which the payment was made This Court further held that there is no single definitive criterion which by itself is demarcative whether a particular outlay is capital or revenue This Court held on consideration of the agreement between the parties that the assessee did not become entitled exclusively even for the period of the agreement to the patents and trademark of the Swiss company it had merely access to technical knowledge and experience in the pharmaceutical field which the Swiss company commanded The assessee on that account have a mere licence for a limited period of a technical knowledge of the Swiss company with the right to use the patent and trademark of that company The assessee acquired under the agreement merely the right to trade for the purpose of carrying on its business as a manufacturer or dealer and obtained the technical knowledge of Swiss company for limited period By making a technical knowledge available the Swiss company did not part with any asset of its business nor did the assessee acquire any asset or advantage of an enduring nature for the benefits of its business and therefore the said contribution was merely a revenue expenditure or a business expenditure <ORG> came to the conclusion that since under the agreement the assessee had no right to manufacture fresh articles on the basis of the know how which had obtained from the foreign firm after the expiry of the period of licence the payments made by the assessee to the foreign firm for the technical know how will be in the nature of a licence fee and will constitute an expenditure in computation of profits and gains and cannot be held to be a capital expenditure In other words the Court answered the question that since the payment in question to be made by the assessee was not related to any specified sum but a percentage of the profits to be earned which were indefinitive in nature Such payment could be treated only as a revenue expenditure <ORG> on consideration of the agreement between the parties came to the conclusion that since patents are not useable after termination of the agreement and the payments are indefinitive in nature based on production of goods the assessee does not acquire any capital asset and therefore such payments made under the agreement are for the purpose of business and derive business expenditure LTR the question for consideration before <ORG> was whether the payments made by the assessee to the foreign firm for the technical know how and the technical advice would be a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure The Court answered the question that since under the agreement the assessee did not acquire a benefit of enduring nature and the so called foreign know how which is availed of in lieu of payment is in substance a transaction of acquiring the necessary technical information with regard to the technique of production and as such it cannot be held to be a capital expenditure and is a revenue expenditure In the said case the assessee company was carrying on the business of manufacture of jute and was a member of <ORG> The Tribunal accepted the assessee contention and had allowed deduction but on a reference being made <ORG> had held that the amount paid by the assessee for purchase of loom hours was in the nature of capital expenditure and as such no deduction could be claimed The expenditure incurred for the purpose of operating the looms for longer working hours was primarily and essentially related to the operation of working of the looms which constituted the profit making apparatus of the appellant and was expenditure laid out as a part of the process of profit earning If the advantage consists merely in facilitating the assessee trading operations or enabling the management and conduct of the assessee business to be carried on more efficiently or more profitably while leaving the fixed capital untouched the expenditure would be on revenue account even though the advantage may endure for an indefinite future There is also no single definitive criterion which by itself is determinative whether a particular outlay is capital or revenue It would thus appear that the courts have applied different tests like starting of a new business on the basis of technical know how received from the foreign firm exclusive right of the company to use the patent or trademark which it receives from the foreign firm the payments made by the company to the foreign firm whether a definite one or dependant upon certain contingencies right to use the technical know how of production or the activity even after the completion of the agreement obtaining enduring benefit for a considerable part on account of the technical informations received from a foreign firm payment whether made once for all or in different instalments co relatable to the percentage of gross turnover of the product to ultimately find out whether the expenditure or payment thus made makes an accretion to the capital asset and after the court comes to the conclusion that it does so then it has to be held to be a capital expenditure But in the case in hand the <ORG> having considered the different clauses of the agreement and having come to the conclusion that under the agreement with the foreign firm what was set up by the assessee was a new business and the foreign firm had not only furnished information and the technical know how but rendered valuable services in setting up of the factory itself and even after the expiry of the agreement there is no embargo on the assessee to continue to manufacture the product in question it is difficult to hold that the entire payment made is a revenue expenditure merely because the payment is required to be made on a certain percentage of the rates of the gross turnover of the products of the income as royalty These appeals are accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances without any order as to costs
