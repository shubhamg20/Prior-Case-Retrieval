no direct recruitment was made but many promotions were effected The <ORG> in tune with the mandate of the quota rule must make serious efforts to secure hands to fill half the number of vacancies from the open market Since the Government took active steps in the direction of direct recruitment the excep tion to the Government Resolution comes into operation There are other matters of moment debated at the bar and we will pass on some of them at later stages there is a duty on the law maker at every level not to injure the community by tengled webs of rules orders and notifications whose meaning is revealed only through tran scendental meditation or constant litigation in a social istic pattern of society there is hardly any part of nation al life or personal life which is not affected by some legal rule or other Government is accordingly pleased to cancel the orders contained in Government Resolution No dated th February and those in Government Resolution No dated the th July in so far as they relate to the recruitment of <ORG> Deputy Collectors Upper Division and to direct that as far as practicable per cent of the substantive vacancies occurring in the cadre with effect from st January should be filled in by nomination of candidates to be selected in accordance with the Rules appended herewith By order and in the name of the Governor of Bombay <NAME> Secretary to Government We may also extract the portion from the annexed rules of recruitment pertinent to our purpose Appointment to the posts of Deputy Collector shall be made either by nomination or by promotion of suitable Mamlatdars Provided that the ratio of appointment by nomination and by promotion shall as far as practicable be ii In the case of officers promoted to substantive vacancies the seniority should be determined with reference to the Date of their promotion to the substantive vacan cies provided there has been no break in service prior to their con firmation in those vacancies One more clarificatory proceeding of <ORG> dated May has loomed large in <NAME> submissions especially the Explanation portion thereof and in a sense it lends some push to the problematic conclusion Reliance has been placed on the Explanation quoted above to emancipate <ORG> from compliance with the Bombay rules regarding appointments of officers or their conditions of service an aspect we will expand if needed The fact of the matter is that during no direct recruitments were made but many promotions were effected administrative pragmatics influence without invalidation the recruitment mechanics where a narrow rider providing for imponderable exigencies written into the rule provides for departure Assuming there has to be a proportion of as above indicated how is it to be worked out On a rotational basis of the direct recruits inexorably getting the first the third the fifth and such like vacancies or as an entitlement to half the total number of vacancies arising in the cadre in a particular year or other conven tional period Again does it further imply an imperative obligation on the part of Government to keep untilled all vacancies allocable to direct recruits so that they may be available to be filled up in later years with retroactive repercussions and if such ear marked posts are for admin istrative exigencies filled regularly not ad hoc in sub stantive vacancies not ex cadre posts by selection and promotion they must be treated as provisional nationally filled by direct recruits who may arrive long later And consequentially in counting seniority reckon their i direct recruits deemed dates of entry as prior to those actually officiating promotee deputy collectors by importing a sort of legal fiction that the direct recruits must be allowed to count service from the date when the entitled vacancy for direct recruits arose May be a diffusive digressive discussion can be obviated and the focus turned on specific issues if we start with a formulation of the major points urged by Sri <NAME> counsel for the appellant hotly controverted of course by shri <NAME> for the contesting respondents The <ORG> of Gujarat had plenary executive power granted by the Constitution to fill up administrative posts in any manner it chose Since it contemplates special situations of impracticability it is but right for the <ORG> so to construe the Resolution in the light of the explanation offered by the <ORG> for non recruitment directly until as to make it adminis tratively viable and reasonably workable If such an imagina tive and informed judicial insight plays upon the rule the difficulties in making immediate recruitments from the open market by <ORG> may sufficiently absolve the <ORG> from the supposed violation of Government Resolution of So viewed the orders of promotion of the appellants are in order and unassailable or rules with legislative colour framed under the proviso to Art It is fair for the <ORG> in a democratic system employing expanding armies of government servants whose lot in life and career prospects will be governed by recruitment conduct and disciplinary rules to respect beyond suspicion the rule of law by exercising statutory power as distinguished from executive power even where it has an option The first question that falls for considerations there fore is as to whether the ratio as between direct recruits and promoted hands is subject to the saving clause as far as practicable Later when direct recruits were secured they would be entitled to their quota vacancies and commencement of seniority from the date of their appointment We have given close thought to the competing contentions and are inclined to the view that the former is the better The straight forward answer seems to us to be that the <ORG> in tune with the mandate of the rule must make serious effort to secure hands to fill half the number of vacancies from the open market It appears that a requisition for posts of deputy collectors was sent to <ORG> on October but the <ORG> raised some linguistic queries regarding the requirement of ade quate knowledge of Marathi and Gujarati by the candidates Anyway various points were raised from time to time in the correspondence between the <ORG> and <ORG> and eventually the former held a competitive examination for the posts of deputy collectors in July declared the results in January and sent up its recommendations in the following February We have earlier dealt with the same submission in a slightly different form and rejected it The question is not whether the year being taken as the unit is the only course but whether there is anything in the rule prescribing Government taking it as the unit or prescribing some other specific unit Moreover there is nothing in the Resolution of preventing Government from treating a year as the unit We therefore reach the following conclusions To sim plify by illustration if deputy collec tors substantive vacancies exist in but promotees were appointed and two direct recruits alone were secured there is a clear transgression of the rule Appointments should be made in accordance with this roster and seniority determined accordingly there is no application of the carry forward rule at all in fact situations where two sources of recruitment are designated in a certain proportion and shortfalls occur in the one or the other category Of course promotions made on an ad hoc basis confer no rights to the posts on the appointees as was clearly pointed out in that decision He has also drawn attention We may straightway state that our Constitutional system is very allergic to arbitrary power but there is nothing arbitrary made out in the present case against the government It is not the interpretation of any existing rule nor laying down of a rule of law so much so we cannot have any guideline therefrom to apply to the present case The <ORG> could no doubt if it so thought expedient frame a specific rule incorporating the roster system so as to regulate seniority Whether the rule stated so or not that was probably the practice and there was nothing unreasonable in it But if there is an enormous deviation other considerations may arise In the present case prior to there was departure from the quota system and that was sanctioned by the rule itself because of special circumstances Of course appointees on an ad hoc basis are never clothed with any rights and have to quit when the exit time arrives but here there are none In <NAME> II Supra the <ORG> ruled If there were promotion in any year in excess of the quota those promotions were merely invalid for that year but they were not invalid for all time We set aside the judgment under appeal but direct <ORG> to draw up de novo a gradation list showing inter se seniority on the lines this judgment directs We direct the <ORG> to act quickly Lack of adequate articulation of simple points regarding rotation and seniority and the amber light shed by case law on the questions raised warrant the direction that parties shall bear their costs throughout
