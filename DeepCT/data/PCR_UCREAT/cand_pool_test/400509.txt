HEADNOTE The appellant obtained a preliminary decree on an anomalous mortgage of a share in the Zamindari village of Sonchari <NAME> in the Patna District and khudkasht land appertaining to the <NAME> against the mortgaged properties with a direction for a personal decree for the balance and there followed a final mortgage decree on It was brought to the notice or this <ORG> that the appellant had preferred a claim tinder the Act and that the Claim Officer had deter mined a sum of Rs Appeal from the judgment and decree dated January of <ORG> in Civil Revision No of The judgment of the Court delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR This appeal has been brought to this Court with a certificate issued by <ORG> and it raises as short question about the scope and effect of the provisions of section of the Bihar Land Reform Act of hereinafter called the Act The appellants then filed an Execution Case No of and that the decretal amount should be realised by sale of the mortgaged Zamindari properties The respondent raised an objection against the appellants claim on the ground that the mortgaged properties had in the meanwhile vested in the State of Bihar under the provisions of the Act and so they were not liable to sale in execution proceedings as the respondent had ceased to have any interest in them When the respondent contested the Execution Case on the ground that the mortgaged properties had vested in the State of Bihar the appellants applied for transfer of their decree for the execution to <ORG> The application made by the appellants for the transfer of decree was granted and the decree was transferred on the nd of January with a certificate of non satisfac tion In these proceedings the respondent filed an objection under section of Code and it was numbered as Misc On the th April <ORG> allowed the appellants application for review and held that the appellants had obtained a personal decree against the respondent and that they had a right to sell the other properties of the respondent in execution of the said personal decree <ORG> held that a personal decree had been passed in favour of the appellants though that part of the direction given in the judgment had not been formally incorporated in the decree <ORG> therefore rejected the respondent contention that no personal decree had been passed since an application had not been made by the appellants under Order Rule of the <ORG> also rejected the respondent argu ment that a Review Application did not lie against the first order passed by <ORG> though it thought that there was some substance in the contention raised by the respondent that on the merits the review need not have been granted It has allowed the Revision Application on the merits because it has held that the appellants have no right to execute the personal decree by proceeding to sell the other properties of the respondent for section of the Act constitutes a bar against such proceedings on this view <ORG> allowed the Revision Application set aside the order passed by <ORG> in favour of the appellants and has ordered that the Execution Application filed by the appellants should be dismissed The first material fact is that all the properties mortgaged by the respondent in favour of the appellants constitute an estate under section of the Act so that we are dealing with a case where the entire mortgaged property belonging to the mortgagor proprietor has vested in the State of Bihar The second point which has to be borne in mind in dealing with the present controversy is that the appellants seek to execute the personal decree against the respondent There is no doubt that under Let us then briefly refer to the relevant provisions of the Act which would enable us to construe section and determine its scope and effect That takes us to section which provides that no suit shall lie in <ORG> for the recovery of Before we deal with this argument it would be convenient to refer to the other relevant sections of the Act The effect of section therefore is that if a claim of the nature referred to in subsection is not duly notified to the Claims Officer within the time and in the manner prescribed by the said sub section the said claim would be barred Section provides for an appeal against the decision of the Claims Officer to a <ORG> whose constitution is prescribed by section So the scheme of Chapter IV which consists of sections to clearly is that all claims based on mortgages relating to estates have to be submitted to the Claims Officer and the amounts due to the creditors have to be determined in accordance with the principles laid down by the Act This provision is in a sense consequential and it provides for the payment of the amount already determined to be justly and legally due to the creditor and so a claim which is made under section would be determined under section and the amount so determined will be paid under a The provisions in the said Chapters constitute an integrated and self sufficient Code for the determination of the amount due to the creditors in question and for their payments and section which occurs in Chapter VIII prescribes a bar to the jurisdiction of Civil Courts in the matters included in it But as we have already seen the provisions contained in section in regard to the scaling down of the debts due by the proprietors and tenure holders clearly indicate that another object which the Act wanted to achieve was to give some redress to the debtors whose estates have been taken away from them by the notifications issued under section Mr <NAME> however suggested that rules of grammer should not be allowed to have an overriding effect if it is shown that putting a literal and grammatical construction on the relevant words would lead to unreasonable or anomalous results and in support of this argument he has invited our attention to the observations made by <NAME> in the case of <ORG> Tucker When you construe a statute or document observed <NAME> you do not construe it according to the mere ordinary general meaning of the words but according to the ordinary meaning of the words as applied to the subject matter with regard to which they are used unless there is something what obliges you to read them in a sense which is not their ordinary sense in the English That being so we are satisfied that on the facts of this case <ORG> was fight in holding that the application made by the appellants to execute the decree against the respondent by proceeding against her non mortgaged properties is incompetent at the present stage This provision is some what similar to the provision of section of the Transfer of Property Act which provides inter alia that where the mortgaged property is acquired under the Land Acquisition Act or any other enactment for the time being in force providing for the compulsory acquisition of immoveable property the mortgagee shall be entitled to claim payment of the mortgage money in whole or in part out of the amount due to the mortgagor as compensation The relevant directions in the decree do not justify the appellants contention that because the mortgaged property has vested in the <ORG> they are entitled to execute the personal decree without taking recourse to the remedy available to them under section of the Act In <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> has held that section of the Act is not applicable to a case where money is secured by a mortgage or charge on estates some of which are notified under section of the Act and the others are not notified Since we are dealing with a case where the whole of the mortgaged property is an estate it I In any case both the decisions on which Mr <NAME> has relied afford no assistance to us in dealing with the point with which we are concerned in the present appeal The result is the order passed by <ORG> if confirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs
