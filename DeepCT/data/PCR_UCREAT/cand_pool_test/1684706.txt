DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH FAZALALI SYED MURTAZA BENCH FAZALALI SYED MURTAZA MUKHARJI SABYASACHI VARADARAJAN A CITATION AIR SCR SCC SCALE CITATOR INFO RF SC RF SC ACT Nature character and concomitants of <NAME> Right of exclusive ownership over the <NAME> during coverture Whether the dowry <NAME> given to a wife and her exclusive property becomes a joint property partnership property by a fiction of being placed in the custody of her husband and her relations the moment a married woman enters her matrimonial home Indian Partnership Act section A perusal of the allegations made in the complaint undoubtedly makes out a positive case of the accused having dishonestly misappropriated the articles handed over to the in a fiduciary capacity If therefore despite demands these articles were refused to be returned to the wife by the husband and his parents it amounted to an offence of criminal breach of trust In such circumstances the complaint should have been given an opportunity by <ORG> to prove her case rather than quashing the complaint A Section of the Hindu Marriage Act merely provides for an alternate remedy and does not touch or affect in any way the criminal liability of the husband in case it is proved that he has dishonestly misappropriated the <NAME> of his wife the mere factum of entrustment of <NAME> would not constitute any co ownership or legal partnership There is also no question of the wife constituting herself a partner with her husband merely by allowing him to keep the article or money in his custody Further in this case there is neither any pleading nor any allegation that after her marriage the appellant transferred all her properties to her husband for carrying on a partnership business in accordance with the provisions of the Partnership Act In the instant case however there is neither any allegation nor anything in the complaint to show that when the wife entered her matrimonial home she had entrusted property to her husband so as to make him part owner of the same A By a pure and simple figment of the fertile imaginations the Judges in the Vinod Kamat case seem to have rewritten the law of criminal breach of trust contained in sections and so as to carve out an imaginary exception to the application of the Penal Code more tragic consequence of the view taken by <ORG> is that even if there is a break in the matrimonial alliance and the wife wants her husband to return her exclusive property and he refuses lo return even then the provisions of section would not apply By a strange and ingenious process of holding that such an act of a husband does not attract the provisions of the Penal Code as the property being joint there is no question of the husband being a trustee or holding the same in a fiduciary capacity For the purpose of exercising its power under section Cr PC to quash a First Information Report or a complaint <ORG> would have to proceed entirely on the basis of the allegations made in the complaint or the documents accompanying the same per se It has no jurisdiction to examine the correctness or otherwise of the allegations In case no offence is committed on the allegation and the ingredients of section and are not made out <ORG> would be justified in quashing the proceedings Since all the facts stated in the complaint constituted an offence under section the appellant cannot be denied the right to prove her case at the trial by pre empting it the very behest by the order passed by <ORG> Thus if the husband or his relations misappropriate the same and refuse to hand it over to the wife and convert them to their own use and even though these facts arc clearly alleged in a complaint for an offence under section some courts take the view that the complaint is not maintainable Thus even when clear and specific allegations are made in the complaint that such properties were entrusted to the husband they refuse to believe these hard facts and brush them aside on the ground that they are vague and completely shut their eyes to the fact that the husband could also be guilty under section in view of the clear allegations made in the complaint In the absence of such a separate agreement for specific entrustment of the property of either spouse the appropriate remedy would appear to be by way of a civil suit where there is scope for the parties to the marriage coming together at the instance of relations elders and well wishers and patching up their differences The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> Sometimes the law which is meant to impart justice and fair play to the citizens or people of the count is so torn and twisted by a morbid interpretative process that instead of giving haven to the disappointed and dejected litigants it negatives their well established rights in law It may be stated that even the old classic Hindu law jurists and celebrated sages conceded certain substantial rights to the women one of which was what is called Saudayika or stridhan with which we are concerned here This now brings us to a brief discussion of the nature character and concomitants of stridhan In the instant case we are mainly concerned with that part of stridhan which is the absolute property of a married women during coverture and by the law as expounded by the commentators of the different schools the unqualified dominion of the husband is limited to only some descriptions of the wife property while as regards the rest he is allowed only a qualified right of use under certain circumstances specifically defined We shall deal with this aspect of the matter a little later We would first like to narrate the facts of the case to show how the complaint filed by the appellant was wrongly quashed by <ORG> The general allegations made in the complaint may be summarised as follows AIR Punjab The complainant was married to <NAME> Accused No respondent on at Ludhiana according to Hindu rites and customs in the presence of respectable persons The must important allegation made by the appellant was that her parents and relatives gave by way of dowry articles worth Rs filed by the complainant in the Court of Shri Tiwana they were persuaded by the parents of the complainant to send the articles entrusted to them at the time of marriage but they gave flat refusal to its notice which was served upon the accused No which was dated but to no effect A perusal of the allegations made in the complaint undoubtedly makes out a positive case of the accused having dishonestly misappropriated the articles handed over to them in a fiduciary capacity In such circumstances the complainant should have been given an opportunity by <ORG> to prove her case rather than quashing the complaint By no stretch of imagination could it be said that the ornaments and sarees and other articles mentioned above could also be used by the husband If therefore despite demands these articles were refused to be returned to the wife by the husband and his parents it amounted to an offence of criminal breach of trust In mentioning the articles in the list we have omitted furniture and utensils which though also belonged to the complainant yet there is some room for saying that these were meant for joint use of the husband and wife Thus the facts mentioned in the complaint taken at their face value reveal a clear allegation that the stridhan property of the appellant was entrusted to the husband who refused to return the same to her Some courts were of the opinion that in view of of the Hindu Marriage Act and of the Hindu Succession act the concept of stridhan property of a woman was completely abolished The sections nowhere provide that the concept of stridhan is abolished or that a remedy under the criminal law for breach of trust is taken away The aforementioned passage shows that a female has an absolute right to use her stridhan in any way she likes and even if her husband can take this property at the time of distress this right is personal to him The allegations made in the instant complaint are not that the husband of the respondent has placed her ornaments and jewellery etc This section at best provides a civil remedy to an aggrieved wife and does not in any way take away her right to file a crimi Crl The sheet anchor of the arguments of the counsel for the respondents which is based on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case is that the moment a woman after Marriage enters her matrimonial home her stridhan property becomes a joint properly of both the spouses and the question of application of I is completely eliminated We would first extract the exact ratio held by <ORG> in <NAME> case To conclude it necessarily follows from the aforesaid discussion that the very concept of the matrimonial home connotes a jointness of possession and custody by the spouses even with regard to the moveable properties exclusively owned by each of them These observations on doubt support the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent but we find it impossible to agree with the aforesaid observations for the reasons that we shall give hereafter There are a large number of cases where criminal law and civil law can run side by side The object of the criminal law is to punish an offender who commits an offence against a person property of the <ORG> for which the accused on proof of the offence is deprived of his liberty and in some cases even his life This does not however affect the civil remedies at all for suing the wrong deer in cases like arson accidents etc Even then the religion and the law enjoins that the husband must compensate the wife and if he cannot do so he must pay fine to the King which means that the husband would be liable to penal action under the present law of the land One of the arguments addressed by the counsel for the respondent which had appealed to thee full Bench of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra as also to our learned Brother <NAME> is that after entering the matrimonial home the custody of the stridhan entrusted by the wife to her husband becomes a sort of a partnership firm and in this view of the matter the question of criminal breach of trust does not arise In the instant case however there is neither any allegation nor anything in the complaint to show that when the wife entered her matrimonial home she had entrusted the property to her husband so as to make him part owner of the same In the instant case there is also no question of the wife constituting herself a partner with her husband merely by allowing him to keep the articles or money in his custody There is neither any pleading nor any allegation that after her marriage the appe AIR SC Thus in our opinion it cannot be said that a bare act of keeping stridhan property in the custody of the husband constitutes a partnership and therefore a criminal case under is not maintainable We have already pointed out that the stridhan of a woman is her absolute property and the husband has no interest in the same and the entrustment to him is just like something which he wife keeps in a Bank and can withdraw any amount whenever she likes without any hitch or hindrance and the husband cannot use the stridhan for his personal purposes unless he obtains the tacit consent of his wife On the allegations in the complaint the husband is no more and no less than a pure and simple custodian acting on half of his wife and if he diverts the entrusted property elsewhere or for different purposes he takes a clear risk of prosecution under of the IPC For these reasons the custody or entrustment of stridhan with the husband does not amount to a partnership in any sense of the term and therefore we are unable to agree with view taken in <NAME> case as also with the opinion expressed by our Brother on the points arising in the case A more tragic consequence of the view taken by the High <ORG> is that even if there is a break in the matrimonial alliance and the wife wants her husband to return her exclusive property and he refuses to return even then the provisions of would not apply By a strange and ingenious process of holding that such an act of a husband does not attract the provisions of the Penal Code as the property being joint there is no question of the husband being a trustee or holding the same in a fiduciary capacity Once it is found as a fact that these articles of dowry were so given to her individually and in her own right then I am unable to see how the mere factum of marriage would alter any such property right and divest her of ownership either totally or partially Consequently there is no reason to assume that the mere user or enjoyment of the dowry by other members of the house hold would have the effect of passing the possession and control thereof jointly to <ORG> as such Consequently unless a special written agreement to the contrary can be established the strongest presumption arises that during the existence and immediately after the crumbling of the matrimonial home there was in essence a joint possession and custody of the property of the spouses therein including dowry and traditional presents which would preclude the essentials of entrustment or dominion over the property which form the cornerstone of criminality under Indian Penal Code articles of dowry which may be for common use and enjoyment in the matrimonial home and articles given as presents to the husband or the parent in law and other members of his family In one breath the Judges say that the bride is entitled to retain her ownership irrespective of her entry and presence in the matrimonial home and in the other they come to the conclusion that the moment a married woman enters her matrimonial home all her properties including her exclusive property become a joint property by a fiction of being placed in the custody of her husband or his relations in any manner entrusted with property it does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of trust But even apart from the latter the mere fact of telling the employees that it is their contribution to the provident fund scheme and then making a deduction or recovery and retaining it constitutes the offence of criminal breach of trust Further the person handing over the property must have confidence in the person taking the property so as to create a fiduciary relationship between them The offence of criminal breach of trust is committed when a person who is entrusted in any manner with property or with dominion over it dishonestly misappropriates it or converts it to his own use the entrustment may arise in any manner whether or not it is fraudulent and the accused must have acquisition or dominion over the property Emphasis supplied We fully endorse this decision and hold that it lays down the correct law on the subject There is a judgment of <ORG> which more or less takes the same view as <ORG> in <NAME> case supra articles which constitute the individual property of the person for whose use it was given and held that the rest of the property falling under categories a and would be property exclusively meant for the use of the bride and once it was brought to the family home the possession would be joint unless by an express written agreement there was an entrustment of the property of the bride to other members of the family By and large this decision toes the line of the view taken by the Punjab and Haryana <ORG> in <NAME> case There is an earlier decision of <ORG> which clearly holds that where there is a clear allegation of entrustment by the wife against the husband he could be prosecuted by a criminal court on a complaint filed by the wife We find ourselves in entire agreement with this decision and hold that this was correctly decided to which two of us were a party this Court made the following observations <ORG> we cannot refrain from observing might well have refused to invoke its inherent powers at the very threshold in order to quash the proceedings for these powers are meant to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection when there is reason to believe that the process of law is being misused to harass a citizen this Court observed as follows Thus it may be safely held that in the following cases an order of the magistrate issuing process against the accused can be quashed or set aside Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in suing process is capricious and arbitrary having been either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible and AIR SC SCR where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects such as want of section or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like The cases mentioned by us are purely illustrative and pro vide sufficient guidelines to indicate contingencies where <ORG> can quash proceedings The same principles would apply mutatis mutandis to a criminal complaint We now come to the question as to whether or not a clear allegation of entrustment and misappropriation of properties was made by the appellant in her complaint and if so was <ORG> justified in quashing the complaint at that stage It is well settled by a long course of this Court that for the purpose of exercising its power under to quash a FIR or a complaint <ORG> would have to proceed entirely on the basis of the allegations made in the complaint or the documents accompanying the same per se It has no jurisdiction to examine the correctness or otherwise of the allegations In case no offence is committed on the allegation and the ingredients of I We have narrated the facts in detail in the earlier part of our judgment but we might again even at the risk of repetition indicate the bare facts which prima facie make out a clear case under IPC against the accused Thus there can be no room for doubt that all the facts stated in the complaint constitute an offence under and the appellant cannot be denied the right to prove her case at the trial by per empting it at the very behest by the order passed by <ORG> Thus if the husband or his relatives misappropriate the same and refuse to hand it over to the wife and convert them to their own use and even though these facts are clearly alleged in a complaint for an offence under I some courts take the complaint is not maintainable Thus even when clear and specific allegations are made in the complaint that such properties were entrusted to the husband they refuse to believe these hard facts and brush them aside on the ground that they are vague The allegations of the complainant in this appeal and the appeal before the Allahabad and <ORG> show that it is not so but is a pure figment of <ORG> imagination as a result of which <ORG> completely shut their eyes to the fact that the husband could also be guilty under I in view of the clear allegations made in the complaint We therefore allow this appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and restore the complaint filed by the appellant and direct that the accused may be summoned if not already summoned and put on trial in accordance with law VARADARAJAN This criminal appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of a learned Single Judge of <ORG> in Criminal Misc and has observed in his judgment that the mere handing over of the articles of dowry of stridhana to the husband and other relations at the time of the marriage does not constitute entrustment in the sense of the word used in ss and I and that it does not amount to passing of dominion over those articles to them The learned Judge has observed that there can be such an entrustment only by a subsequent conscious act of volition and that in the absence of such an act any allegations of breach of trust between the husband and wife cannot constitute an offence under I The learned Judge has further observed that between the husband and wife there is always a jointness of control and possession of the properties of the spouse within the matrimonial home and that it goes against the very concept of entrustment of his or her property by one spouse to the other The appellant has therefore come to this Court in appeal by special leave impleading the petitioners before <ORG> who are only two out of the six respondents in the complaint as respondents in this appeal for quashing a criminal complaint the allegations made in the complaint have to be taken to be correct in order to find out whether they constitute the various ingredient of the offence alleged In Nagawa Veernna Shivalingappa Konjalgi Ors illustrations have been given of cases in which it may be safely held that an order of a Magistrate issuing process against an accused can be quashed or set aside Suppl Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused Where the allegations made in the complaint are palpably absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible and Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects such as want of sanction or absence of a complaint by a legally competent authority and the like Article in <NAME> Hindu Law Fifteenth Edition describing what constitutes Stridhana reads property given or bequeathed to a Hindu female whether during maidenhood coverture or widowhood by her parents and their relation or by her husband and his relations is stridhana according to all schools except that the Dayabhaga does not recognise immovable property given or bequeathed by husband to his wife as stridhana Section of the Dowry prohibition Act defines dowry as meaning any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly a by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or by the parents of either party to the marriage or by any other person to either party to the marriage or to any other person at or before of after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr in the case of person to whom the Muslim personal law Shariat applies The expression entrustment carries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that property is handed over to anther continues to be its owner Further the person handing over the property must have confidence in the person taking the property so as to create a fiduciary relationship between them There is no doubt an allegation in the complaint that these articles were given and entrusted to the respondents in the complaint at Ludhiana at the time of doll on The articles were given for the use of the wife If so could there be entrustment of the articles to such a number of diverse persons In the background of what usually happens in Hindu marriages namely placing of the articles presented to the bride in the presence of the elders and others assembled for the occasion and removal thereof after the function is over it has to be seen whether the allegation made in the complaint amounts to entrustment as required by law to make out an offence under This question has been considered in detail by <ORG> of the Punjab and Haryana <ORG> in <NAME> case supra after an analysis of several decision relating to the question To conclude on this aspect I find nothing in the codification of Hindu Law which in any way abolishes the concept of stridhana or the right of a Hindu wife to exclusive individual ownership What indeed is the true legal relationship of the husband and wife qua the property individually owned by each within the four walls of the matrimonial home Does the wife stand entrusted with the property belonging to her husband individually and vice versa the husband stands entrusted with such property vesting in the exclusive ownership of the wife It is the answer to this question which in essence would determine the attraction and applicability of Section I betwixt the spouses It bears repetition that the question herein has to be examined against the backdrop of the matrimonial home Rather it appears to me that the conjugal relationship and the existence of a matrimonial home automatically obviates any such hyper technicalities of an entrustment or dominion over property The aforesaid position seems to be well borne out by a homely example which was rightly advanced by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioners Criminal Breach of trust Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or wilfully suffers any other Person so to do commits criminal breach of trust The relief sought therein of quashing the proceedings under Indian Penal Code betwixt partners was granted whilst holding that a charge under Indian Penal Code cannot be framed against a person who according to the complainant is a partner with him and is accused of the offence in respect of property belonging to them as partners If that is so in the partnership relation it appears to me that it would be more so in the conjugal relationship with regard to the property within the matrimonial home If the civil remedy seems to be adequate betwixt partners during the subsistence of partnership there is no reason why it would not equally be so betwixt spouses in an existing matrimonial home during the subsistence of the conjugal relationship Consequently unless a special written agreement to the contrary can be established the strongest presumption arises that during the existence and immediately after the crumbling of the matrimonial home there was in essence a joint possession and custody of the property of the spouses therein including dowry and traditional presents which would preclude the essentials entrustment of dominion over the property which form the corner stone of criminality under Indian Penal Code Consequently there is no reason to assume that the mere use or enjoyment of dowry by other members of the household would have the effect of passing the possession and control thereof Jointly to <ORG> a such To conclude it necessarily follows from the aforesaid discussion that the very concept of the matrimonial home cannotes a jointness of possession and custody by the spouses even with regard to the movable properties exclusively owned by each of them Inevitably therefore the purported allegations of breach of trust betwixt husband and wife so long as the conjugal relation ship lasts and the matrimonial home subsists cannot constitute an offence under Section of the Indian Penal Code subject to any special written agreement I have extracted above several passages from the Judgment of the learned judges of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra since I share their view and concern for peace and harmony in matrimonial homes and feel that the learned Single Judge who has quashed the wife complaint in the present case was justified in relying heavily upon that judgment of <ORG> In the absence of such a separate agreement for specific entrustment of the property of either spouse the appropriate remedy would appear to be by way of a civil suit where there is scope for the parties to the marriage coming together at the instance of relations elders and well wishers and patching up their differences I would therefore dismiss the appeal
