DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH RAMASWAMY BENCH RAMASWAMY FAIZAN UDDIN PATTANAIK ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT This appeal by special leave arises from <ORG> Judgment of <ORG> made on September in No In September the respondent filed writ petition in <ORG> seeking to quash the notification under Section and the declaration under Section <ORG> by judgments dated May and September dismissed the appeals which became final The object of the publication of the notification under Section was that the land is needed for a public purpose or is likely to be needed the officers of the <ORG> are authorised to enter upon the land and carry on measurement etc and the owner interested person was put on notice that any encumbrance hereafter would not bind <ORG> After elaborate consideration of the various judgments of <ORG> and dictionary meaning of the words arable in that behalf this Court has relied thus There is no definition of the word arable in the original Land Acquisition Act Since this Court has consistently taken the view that compliance of the requirement of the publication of the notification under Section in the <ORG> as well as publication of the substance of the notification in the locality now under the Amended Act in the newspaper is mandatory requirement The question then is whether Section notification and Section declaration are required to be quashed In this regard we have to consider the conduct of the parties and the effect thereof Under the scheme of the Act after the possession of the land was taken either under Section or Section the land stands vested in <ORG> free from all encumbrances Thereafter there is no provision under the Act to divest the title which was validly vested in the <ORG> the question arose whether notification under Section and the declaration under Section gets lapsed if the award is not made within two years as envisaged under Section A A Bench of three Judges had held that once possession was taken and the land vested in the <ORG> title to the land so vested in the State is subject only to determination of compensation and to pay the same to owner Divesting the title to the land statutorily vested in the <ORG> and reverting the same to the owner is not Section gives power to withdraw from acquisition that too before possession is taken That question did not arise in this case The property under acquisition having been vested in the appellants in the absence of any power under the act to have the title of appellants divested except by exercise of the power under Section valid title cannot be defeated The exercise of the power to quash the notification under Section and the declaration under Section would lead to incongruity In <NAME> case another Bench of three Judges had held that though award under Section A was not within two years after the Amendment Act of came into force the title having been vested in the <ORG> the notification under Section and declaration under Section do not get lapsed and non compliance of statutory provisions does not have the effect of divesting the title of the land vested in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Recently another Bench of this <ORG> in <ORG> Vs <ORG> A No of decided on September reexamined the entire case law and held that once the land was vested in the State the <ORG> was not justified in interfering with the notification published under appropriate provisions of the Act It is thus well settled law that when there is inordinate delay in filing the writ petition and when all steps taken in the acquisition proceedings have become final the <ORG> should be loathe to quash the notifications The High <ORG> has no doubt discretionary powers under Article of the Constitution to quash the notification under Section and declaration under Section When the award was passed and possession was taken the <ORG> should not have exercised its power to quash the award which is a material factor to be taken into consideration before exercising the power under Article <ORG> of the High <ORG> was not right in interfering with the discretion exercised by the learned single Judge dismissing the writ petition or the ground of latches The order may be hypothetically a nullity but the court may refuse to quash it because of the plaintiff lack of standing because he does not deserve a discretionary remedy because he has waived his rights or for some other legal reason It follows that an order may be void for one purpose and valid for another and that it may be void against one person but valid against another The order or action if ultra vires the power it becomes void and it does not confer any right In that case since the award had not been passed this Court had given the direction but in this case award determining the compensation has attained finality
