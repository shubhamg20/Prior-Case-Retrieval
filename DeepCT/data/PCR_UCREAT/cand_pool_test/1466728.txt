The result of this examination was announced by <ORG> in April and the Government made appointments out of which were from among the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes The petitioner who was an assistant in Grade IV of <ORG> who expected to become a Section Officer Assistant Superintendent by way of promotion challenged the validity of the carry forward rule on the grounds inter alia that the rule contravened Arts of the Constitution a reservation of a reasonable percentage of posts for members of the Scheduled SC India Castes and Tribes is within the competence of the <ORG> the method evolved by the Government must be such as to strike a reasonable balance between the claims of the backward classes and claims of other employees in order to effectuate the guarantee contained in Art Recruitment to the post of Section Officer is made in the following manner i by direct recruitment from those who obtained lower ranks in the I A etc <ORG> however made only appointments out of which were from among the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes It is the petitioner case that had <ORG> and the adhered to the quota of reservations in favour of Scheduled Castes and Tribes he would have had a fair chance of being selected to the post of Assistant Superintendent However even carrying forward the vacancies for one year proved to be inadequate for giving effect to the policy of <ORG> to give adequate representation in the services to members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes India which are being challenged by the petitioner in this petition which he has presented to this <ORG> under Art of the Constitution provides that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Mr <NAME> who appears for the petitioner concedes that under cl of Art it is open to the <ORG> to make provision for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services of the <ORG> Then according to him the standard for all candidates must be the same and <ORG> has no power to recommend for appointment candidates from Scheduled Castes and Tribes for appointment to the reserved posts even though they have secured far less marks than the candidates belonging to the more advanced communities On behalf of the respondents it is claimed that the carry forward rule is perfectly valid that it was a rule in force before the commencement of the Constitution and that it was decided to continue it even after the Constitution came into force as a matter of public policy and for giving effect to the provisions of the Constitution and that that is why supplementary instructions were issued by the Government in It was contended on behalf of the respondents that having regard to the prayers in the petition the petition was unsustainable in law because the persons who would be adversely affected have not been joined as respondents The respondents denied that the petitioner has any right much less a fundamental right While replying in detail paragraph by paragraph to the petition the respondents admitted that at the competitive examination held in pursuance Of the notification of March vacancies which had been filled in the two previous years from amongst candidates who belong to communities other than the Scheduled Castes and Tribes because suitable candidates from the latter classes were not available and stated that by operation of the carry forward rule those vacancies were therefore earmarked for being filled at the competitive examination held in the year in addition to of the total vacancies to be filled that year In the third year the number of posts to be filled from amongst candidates of Scheduled Castes and Tribes would thus be of the total vacancies to be filled in that year plus the total unfilled vacancies which have been carried forward from the two previous years It cannot be used for creating monopolies or for unduly or illegitimately disturbing the legitimate interests of other employees It is enough for us to say that while any method can be evolved by the Government it must strike a reasonable balance between the claims of the backward classes and claims of other employees as pointed out in <NAME> case We would like to emphasise that the guarantee contained in Art In order to effectuate the guarantee each year of recruitment will have to be considered by itself and the reservation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities It is true as pointed out by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondent that effect must be given to the express words of Art Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of appointments but that does not mean that the provision made by the <ORG> should have the effect of virtually obliterating the rest of Going back on his earlier concession it was contended by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioner that there can possibly be no reservation whatsoever in favour of members of Scheduled Castes or Tribes or any of the backward classes and that the proper way of discharging the duty laid upon the State by Art In this connection he has referred us to the following passage from the judgment of this Court in <NAME> case Supp In supporting the impugned rule reliance was placed on behalf of the respondents upon a passage from the judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> case Art The validity of the carry forward rule was not challenged in that case and therefore this Court had no occasion to say anything concerning it reservation of vacancies to be filled in a particular year or reservation of vacancies in excess of would according to the decision in <NAME> case not be constitutional of the Constitution which reads thus The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a <ORG> Indeed no further relief can be given to him because the persons who have been appointed and who may be affected by this decision have not been joined as respondents in this petition In the result the petition succeeds partially and the carry forward rule as modified in is declared invalid The facts are fully stated in the judgment of my learned brother and I need not restate them There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> The <ORG> shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of a <ORG> There is no conflict between these three provisions Article is a mandatory direction given to the <ORG> to take the claims of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes into consideration in the making of appointments to the said services and posts Article empowers the <ORG> to make a provision for the reservation of posts and appointments for the backward classes which certainly include Article lays down the general rule of equality It says that there shall be equality of op portunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> Though theoretically they are given equal opportunity to run the race in practice the ordinary horse is not given an equal opportunity to compete with the race horse It follows that if a provision is for the reservation of appointments or posts the clause does not further circumscribe the power of the <ORG> to make any provision to achieve that object Backward class is not defined whether a particular class is backward or not is a question of fact in each case and it must satisfy certain objective tests confers an individual right on a citizen and cl of the said Article which embodies the principle of social justice is He further elaborates that as every citizen has an individual right to apply for appointments whenever applications are called for he cannot be deprived of his right on the ground that in a previous selection the community to which that individual belongs had more than its share It is further contended that the concept of reservation for a community implies the carving of a part of the entire field and that if the provision covers the entire field or a major part of it it ceases to be a reservation and therefore not protected by cl The learned Judge observed at thus Suppose there are posts in a particular service and the backward classes have no representation at all in that service The <ORG> considers it necessary that they should have adequate representation in that service It will then be open to the <ORG> having reserved posts in this particular service for backward classes to say that till these posts are filled up by backward classes all appointments will go to them provided the minimum qualifications that may be prescribed are fulfilled Once the representation is adequate there will be no power left for making further reservation Thus by the method of reservation of appointments the representation is made adequate in a long period of time while by the method of reserving posts the representation is made adequate in a much shorter period No doubt these observations were made in a different context but they show that reservation can be made in the posts i in the cadre strength or in the annual ap pointments to be made in the service in order to keep it at full strength The following may be some of the methods of implementing the provision for reservation The cadre strength of a particular service is the State may reserve posts out of them for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and make appointments solely from the said Castes and Tribes till the percentage reserved is reached In the same contingency instead of providing for thecarrying over of the said vacancies to the next selection the said vacancies may be filled up by candidates belonging to castes other than the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes but the seats reserved to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes but not filled up by them may be added to those reserved for them in the next selection The State instead of applying the principle of carry forward may provide that if the applicants belonging to the said Castes and Tribes are not sufficient in the first selection to come up to the percentage reserved a larger percentage of candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be selected in the next year or the year after There are no merits in the contention that the principle of carry forward has resulted in the third year in the selection of candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes to a tune of per centum of the total applicants for that year and therefore the selection amounted to destruction of the fundamental right Reservation made in one selection or spread over many selections is only a convenient method of implementing the provision of reservation There is neither an allegation nor evidence in this case to that effect It was contended before this <ORG> on behalf of the petitioners therein that the impugned order which had been passed under Art In the present case it is not disputed that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are backward classes and there is no material on which I can hold that the Government committed a fraud on the constitutional power conferred on it These general observations made in the context of admissions to college cannot in my view be applied in the case of a reservation of appointments in the matter of recruitment to a cadre of particular service
