At the time of the appellant reversion there were two letters from <ORG> making certain allegations against the appellant These letters show that the authorities concerned came to the conclusion that pending the enquiry the appellant should not be allowed to officiate in a higher post It was contended in this court that the order of reversion was by way of punishment and since it had been made without complying with the requirements of Art The entirety of circumstances preceding or attendant on the impugned order must be examined by the court and the overriding test will always be whether the misconduct is a mere motive or is the very foundation of the order The appellant had no vested right to retain that post In case the authorities concerned came to the conclusion that the appellant should not be allowed to retain the post of which he was officiating they could pass an order for his reversion without complying with the requirements of Art nevertheless if a right exists under the contract or the rules to terminate the services the motive operating on the mind of the <ORG> is wholly immaterial The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against a <ORG> decision of <ORG> whereby petition under article of the Constitution of India filed by the appellant was dismissed The appellant filed writ petition No of in <ORG> challenging the order of his reversion but the same was summarily dismissed by <ORG> of that court as per order dated September Representation was made by the appellant against the order of his reversion but the representation too was rejected by the State Government as per letter dated October The writ petition which has given rise to this appeal was thereafter filed by the petitioner praying for quashing the order by which he had been reverted from the post of Officiating General Manager to that of Assistant General Manager as well as the orders whereby his representation bad been rejected On merits also the learned Judges did not accept the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant and held that as he was only officiating as General Manager he did not have any lien on that post The Government in the opinion of <ORG> was entitled in exercise of its power to revert a person who was officiating in a higher post Contention was also raised that the order of reversion was violative of the principles of natural justice but this contention was repelled The appellant had no vested right to retain that post In case the authorities concerned came to the conclusion that the appellant should not be allowed to retain the post in which he was officiating they could pass an order for his reversion without complying with the requirements of article provided the order was not by way of punishment Appointment to a post on an officiating basis is from the nature of employment itself of a transitory character and in the absence of any contract or specific rule regulating the conditions of service to the contrary the implied term of such an appointment is that it is terminable at any time The <ORG> servant so appointed acquires no right to the post The circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination of service have to be examined in each case the motive behind it being immaterial If the order visits the public servant with any evil consequences or casts an aspersion against his SCR character or integrity it must be considered to be one by way of punishment no matter whether he was a mere probationer or a temporary servant An order of termination of service in unexceptionable form preceded by an enquiry launched by the superior authorities only to ascertain whether the public servant should be retained in service does not attract the operation of Art i an Enquiry Officer is appointed a charge sheet submitted explanation called for and considered any order of termination of service made thereafter will attract the operation of the said article The appellant was merely officiating in a higher post and the impugned order had the effect of reverting him to his substantive post In the other letter addressed to the Secretary to Uttar Pradesh <ORG> <ORG> a request was made by the Deputy Secretary <ORG> that in case the appellant was not confirmed on the post of General Manager he might be reverted since an enquiry made by the <ORG> into the allegations of corruption against the appellant had revealed that there was substance in those allegations The above letters would show that the authorities concerned came to the conclusion that pending the holding of an open enquiry into the charges of corruption against the appellant he should not be allowed to officiate in a higher post Application was filed during the pendency of the appeal on behalf of the appellant that this Court might take into account additional documents These documents were in existence at the time the appellant filed the petition in <ORG> In the circumstances the application filed by the appellant for taking on record additional documents in appeal is rejected
