the Gujarat High <ORG> by its decision dated held that cotton fabrics subjected to bleaching dyeing and printing could not be subjected to excise duty under Item of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act is at twenty per cent ad valorem these activities not being taxable event in the light of section read with of the Act The President of India promulgated an Ordinance being Central ordinance No of called the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Ordinance Similar amendments were made in items and of the First Schedule with retrospective effect Section of the Amending Act provided no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any other <ORG> for the refund of the duty collected and no enforcement shall be made by any <ORG> of any decree or order directing the refund of such duties of excise which have been collected and which may have been collected Some other petitioners similarly situated have also filed their petitions under Article of the Constitution In view of the amendments made in section of the Central Excises and Salt Act by Amending Act VI of as well as the substitution of new Item and in Excise Tariff in place of the original items the activities of the petitioner company namely as an independent processing unit engaged in job activities of dyeing printing and finishing of man made cotton fabrics attract the exigibility to excise duties under section and of the Act Manufacture is complete as soon as by the application of one or more process the raw material undergoes some change If a new substance is brought into existence or if a new or different article having a distinctive name character or use result from particular processes such process or processes would amount to manufacture The moment there is transformation into a new commodity commercially known as a distinct and separate commodity having its own character use and name whether be it the result of one process or several processes manufacture takes place and liability to duty under section is attracted Here in the light of several decision of <ORG> and the High <ORG>s and on the construction of the expression the process of bleaching dyeing and printing etymologically means manufacturing process The processes of the type which have been incorporated by the Act VI of were not so alien or foreign to the concept of manufacture that these could not come within that concept covered by entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule A The question whether the impugned Act is covered by entry can be looked from another point of view namely the actual contents of entry The word produced appearing in entry no of List I of the Seventh Schedule is used in juxtaposition with the word manufactured and used in connection with the duty of excise and consequently it contemplates same expenditure of human skill in bringing the goods concerned into the condition which would attract the duty To contend that if the legislation was sought to be defended on the ground that it is a tax on activity like processing and would be covered by the a powers enumerated under entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule there was no charging section for such an activity and as such the charge must fail and there cannot be any levy is wrong and misconceived It stipulates the levy and charge of duty of excise on all excisable goods produced or manufactured It is well recognised that i tax may be imposed retrospectively and that by itself would not be unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business and ii the <ORG> has powers to make retrospective legislation including fiscal legislation and such legislation per se is not unreasonable Here there is no particular feature of this legislation which can be said to create any unreasonable restriction upon the petitioners Nor does the impugned legislation act harshly nor there is any scope for arbitrariness or discrimination Furthermore it was made clear that in so far as past assessments were concerned refund of excise duties to manufactu rers as ordered by the High <ORG> would have only meant a fortuitous windfall so as to benefit such persons without any relief to the ultimate consumers A who had purchased the fabrics and had borne the burden of the duties Where for the purpose of calculating assessable profits a notional and conventional sum is laid down by the legislature to be arrived at on a certain basis it is not permissible for the courts to engraft into it any other deduction or allowance or addition or read it down on the score that the said deduction or allowance or addition was authorised elsewhere in the Act or in the Rules The circumstances that thereby the benefit of any exemption granted by the legislation may be lost and that in some cases hardship might result are not matters which would influence courts on the construction of the statute A tax payer subject is entitled only to such benefit as is granted by the legislature And in this case there is no hardship When the textile fabrics are subjected to the processes like bleaching dyeing and printing etc by independent processes whether on their own account or on job charges basis the value of the purposes of assessment under section of the Central Excise Act will not be the processing charges alone but the intrinsic value of the processed fabrics which is the price at which such fabrics are sold for the first time in the wholesale market The value would naturally include the value of grey fabrics supplied to the independent processors for the processing However excise duty if any paid on the grey fabrics will be given proforma credit to the independent processors to be utilised for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance with the Rules A or of the Central Excise Rules as the case may be A Read in that context and in the context of the prevalent practice followed so long until the decision of the Gujarat High <ORG> in Real Honest case there is no hardship and no injustice to the petitioners or the manufacturers of grey fabrics Different <ORG>s sometimes pass different interim orders as the courts think fit The interim orders passed by particular courts on certain considerations arc not precedents for other cases may be on similar facts To contend that once an interim order has been passed by <ORG> on certain A factors specially in fiscal matters in subsequent matters on more or less similar facts there should not be a different order passed nor should there by any variation with that kind of interim order passed Every bench hearing a matter on the facts and circumstances of each case should have the right to grant interim orders on such terms as it considers fit and proper and if it had granted interim order at one stage it should have right to vary or alter such interim orders In that view of the matter <ORG> shall refrain from passing any interim orders staying the realisations of indirect taxes or passing such orders which have the effect of non realisation of indirect taxes The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> I agree with my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> that Writ Petitions Nos of and and of and Civil Appeals Nos of and of have to be dismissed with costs and that Civil Appeals Nos to of have to be allowed with costs and interim orders if any passed should stand vacated and arrears of excise duties should be paid forthwith and future excise duty should be paid as and when the goods are cleared or otherwise as per law and rules But I regret my inability to subscribe to the views expressed by him in the last two paras of his judgment regarding interim orders The President of India promulgated an Ordinance being Central Ordinance No of called the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Ordinance The said impugned Act received the assent of the President on th February and under section of the impugned Act retrospective effect to the Act was given from th February As a result of the said decision and with a view to overcome the said decision the Ordinance mentioned hereinbefore was promulgated on th November which has since been replaced by the said Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Act We will refer to the said decision later Special leave to appeal to this Court has been granted from the said decision in the case of <ORG> In order to appreciate the contentions raised it is necessary to state that the petitioner company is an independent processing unit carrying on its activities at Bombay and as an independent processing unit was engaged in job activities of dyeing printing and finishing of man made cotton fabrics When the said fabrics are received in the factory of the petitioner company the same are fully manufactured and are in a saleable condition and are commercially known as grey fabrics i unprocessed fabrics which are cleared after payment of the excise duty under Tariff Item Nos and as the case may be The machinery installed by the petitioner company in its factory is only for the purpose of carrying out one or more of the aforesaid four processes and cannot be used for the purpose of either spinning or weaving of yarn for manufacture of fabric i woven material The petitioner company states that it has no discretion or choice of shades or colours or designs and the same are nominated or prescribed by the customers The petitioner company further states that it has no proprietary interest in the fabrics either before or after the same is processed The respondents government authorities according to the petitioners although being aware of the fact that the petitioner company was carrying out and or performing merely the processing work and collecting the processing charges only had directed the petitioner company to file a price list on the basis of the sale price of its customers and for this purpose had required the petitioner company to file along with the said price list letters of its customers certifying the price at which the said customers sell the goods in the markets The petitioner company further states that it bad filed a writ petition in <ORG> which was admitted Section of the impugned Act amends section of the Excise Act by adding three sub items in the definition of Manufacture which were included by Act of being the impugned Act which came into effect from th November which are sub clauses vi and vii According to section of the impugned Act no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any other court for the refund of the same and no enforcement shall be made by any court of any decree or order directing the refund of such duties of excise which have been collected and which may have been collected as if the provisions of section of the impugned Act had been in force on and from the appointed day as defined in the impugned Act As mentioned hereinbefore an application for special leave to appeal to this Court had been filed from the said decision of <ORG> these appeals are pending and would be disposed of by this judgment It may be mentioned that so long as the respondents had been collecting and the petitioners had been paying excise duty and or additional duty as the petitioner company was manufacturing cotton fabrics under Tariff Item Nos and as the case may be Cotton fabrics other than i embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs and ii fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artificial plastic materials a cotton fabrics not subjected to any process Twenty per cent ad valorem cotton fabrics subjected to the process of bleaching mercerising dyeing printing water proofing rubberising shrink proofing organdie processing or any other process or any two or more of these processes Twenty per cent ad valorem XXX XXX XXX Man made fabrics other than i embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs ii fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artificial plastic materials a man made fabrics not subjected to any process man made fabrics subjected to the process of bleaching dyeing printing shrink proofing tentering heat setting crease resistant processing or any other process or any two or more of these processes It provided that cotton fabrics means all varieties of fabrics manufactured either wholly or partly from cotton and includes dhoties sarees chadders bed sheets bed spreads counter panes table cloths embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs and fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artificial plastic materials Cotton fabrics other than i embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs and ii fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artificial plastic materials This item referred to man made fabrics and by the amendment man made fabrics have again been divided into two categories namely a man made fabrics not subjected to any process and man made fabrics subjected to different processes referred to in clause The Amendment Act has been made retrospective in operation and so far as cotton fabrics are concerned it became operative from st March and so far as man made fabrics are concerned it became operative from th June Section of the Amendment Act also validates duties of excise already levied assessed or collected on cloth cotton cloth cotton fabrics woollen fabrics rayon or artificial silk fabrics and man made fabrics subjected to any process It provides that all duties of excise levied assessed or collected or purported to have been levied assessed or collected before the date of commencement of the Amendment Act on i cloth cotton cloth and cotton fabrics subjected to any process ii woollen fabrics subjected to any process iii rayon or artificial silk fabrics and man made fabrics subjected to any process under any Central Act shall be deemed to be and shall be deemed always to have been as validly levied assessed or collected as if the provisions of section had been in force on and from the appointed day It is also expressly enacted in section of the Amendment Act that every Central Act as in force at any time during the period commencing with the appointed day and ending with day immediately preceding the date of commencement of the Amendment Act and providing for or relating to the levy of duties of excise on a cloth cotton cloth or as the case may be cotton fabrics woollen fabrics rayon or artificial silk fabrics or as the case may be man made fabrics shall have and shall be deemed to have always had effect during the said period as if i such cloth or as the case may be cotton fabrics comprised for the purpose of the duty leviable under the Excise Act A a sub item covering such cloth cotton cloth or cotton fabrics not subjected to any process mentioned in sub clause of clause of section of the Central Excise Act as amended by this Act and a sub item covering such cloth cotton cloth or cotton fabrics subjected to any such process or any two or more such processes and the rate or duty specified in such Act with respect to such cloth cotton cloth or cotton fabrics had been specified separately with respect to each of the aforementioned sub items thereof Similar provision was also made in clause iii of sub section of section in respect of rayon or artificial silk fabrics or man made fabrics It deals with duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India It may be mentioned that the charging section i section of the Central Excises and Salt Act empowers the levy and collection in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and a duty on salt manufactured in or imported by land into any part of India as they apply in respect of goods at rates set forth in the First Schedule to the said Act Excisable goods under section means goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt It was submitted that all that was being done was that fully manufactured cotton fabrics is subjected to further process of bleaching dyeing and printing and therefore the article still continues to be cotton fabric and no different article having distinctive features character and use comes into existence On the other hand on behalf of the revenue it was urged that the processes of bleaching dyeing and printing were essentially manufacturing processes inasmuch as a result of these processes a new substance known to the market is brought into being Their contention was that at no stage they produced any new products which could come within the items described in the Schedule as vegetable non essential oils all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power The contention of the revenue was that the manufacturers in the course of manufacture of Vanaspati which was a vegetable product from the raw ground nut and til oil brought into existence what is known in the market as refined oil after carrying out some process with the aid of power and it fell within the description of vegetable non essential oils and as such was liable to duty And in that context it was pointed out by this Court that excise duty was a duty on the manufacture of goods and not on sale After referring to the arguments of respective parties this Court noted at page of the report the contention on behalf of the revenue that manufacture was complete as soon as by the application of one or more process the raw material underwent some change It further stated To say this is to equate processing to manufacture and for this we can find no warrant in law The word manufacture used as a verb is generally SUPP The passage runs thus Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use Hence according to this decision if a new substance is brought into existence or if a new or different article having a distinctive name character or use results from particular processes such process or processes would amount to manufacture It may be mentioned that this Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax Lucknow <NAME> and Sons pointed out that the word manufacture has various shades of meaning and in the context of sales tax legislation if the goods to which some labour was applied remained essentially the same commercial article it could not be said that the final product was the result of manufacture Referring to the <ORG> decision in the case of <NAME> supra this Court observed at page as follows The decision of <ORG> might perhaps be justified on the ground that a printed or dyed cloth is commercially a different article from the cloth which is purchased and printed or dyed On behalf of the revenue great emphasis was laid on the view that even according to this <ORG> printed or dyed cloth was a commercially different article from the cloth which is purchased and printed or dyed The Division Bench in that case positively took the view that sizing bleaching or dyeing of raw cloth turns it into a different marketable commodity and as such amounted to manufacture of a commercially new product It was contended that processing the manufactured fabric does not bring into existence any new woven material but the question is does new and different goods emerge having distinctive name use and character Where the words used in an entry are comprehensive or wide enough to include all kinds or types of particular goods falling within the description the question was whether their scope should be restricted and in that context it was held that mere change in form or colour of the goods by reason of any processing cannot be held to be sufficient ground for removing it from its original classification In the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax Lucknow <NAME> and Sons supra it was held that the word manufacture has various shades of meaning and in the contest of sales tax legislation if the goods to which some labour is applied remain essentially the same commercial article it cannot be said that the Vol Though in the facts of that case in the context of Sales Tax Law it was held that there was no manufacture the principles enunciated by this Court are in the following terms There are several criteria for determining whether a commodity is consumed in the manufacture of another The generally prevalent test is whether the article produced is regarded in the trade by those who deal in it as distinct in identity from the commodity involved in its manufacture The nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps a different kind of processing at each stage But it is only when the change or a series of changes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct article that a manufacture can be said to take place Where there is no essential difference in identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that one commodity has been Although it A has undergone a degree of processing it must be regarded as still retaining its original identity The moment there is transformation into a new commodity commercially known as a distinct and separate commodity having its own character use and name whether be it the result of one process or several processes manufacture takes place and liability to duty is attracted <ORG> held that cotton fabrics subjected to bleaching dyeing and printing could not be subjected to excise duty under Item This decision has two aspects one which was emphasised on behalf of the revenue i that <ORG> accepted the position that processes of bleaching dyeing and printing were manufacturing processes and such on the strength of that decision it could not be said that these processes do not amount to manufacture and on the other which was stressed on behalf of the petitioners was that such processes could not transform the cloth I CC <ORG> decision which is reported at page of the report is as follows In the instant case the excise duty claimed on the basis of the market value of the processed cotton fabrics or man made fabrics cannot be levied because assuming that process amounts to manufacture all that they have done is to manufacture processed cloth processed fabric either cotton or man made and that not being a taxable event in the light of Section read with section of the Act and Items and levy of excise duty on this basis was ultra vires and contrary to law Therefore the petitioners are entitled to the refund of the excess of excise duty paid by them during the period of last three years immediately preceding the filing of the Special Civil Application over what they were bound to pay on the footing that processing of cotton fabrics is an excisable activity covered by Item Item refers to All other goods not specified elsewhere manufactured in a factory The main question that fell for consideration before <ORG> was whether the articles fell within Tariff Entry or as contended by the revenue or under residuary Entry It appears in the light of the several decisions and on the construction of the expression that the process of bleaching dyeing and printing etymologically also means manufacturing processes VIII processing the cloth exported was the same as the cloth sold by the petitioners in that case and they were therefore not entitled to exemption under the notification It was also pointed out that the expression such cloth or yarn would mean cloth or yarn manufactured in Uttar Pradesh and sold and those words had nothing to do with the transformation by printing and designs on the cloth But since the decision turned on the construction of the notification in which any change in appearance or transformation of an article into another did not become relevant the decision would not be of assistance in disposing of the present case This question has been elaborately considered by the Bombay High <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and other petitions heard along with the same and are under appeals to this <ORG> by special leave They did not make saccharin and in my opinion from the way in which the word is used by the statute they did not manufacture A saccharin and therefore did not require a licence In support of the question whether actually there is manufacture or not various documents were attempted to be utilised at the hearing of the application before us Arguments however were advanced on behalf of the petitioners that in entry of List I of Seventh Schedule the expression manufacture cannot be extended to include processes which were not manufacture It is true that entries though should be widely construed these should not be so construed as to bring in something which has nothing to do with the manufacture Reliance was placed on several decisions for this purpose As has been noted processes of the type which have been incorporated by the impugned Act were not so alien or foreign to the concept of manufacture that these could not come within that Concept The question whether the impugned Act is covered by entry can be looked from another point of view namely the actual contents of entry The word produced appearing in entry No of List I of the Seventh Schedule is used in just a position with the word manufactured according to <ORG> and used in connection with duty of excise and consequently it would appear to contemplate some expenditure of human skill and labour in bringing the goods concerned into the condition which would attract the duty Reference was made to the observations of <ORG> Where <ORG> held that the respondents before them were producers of coal It was then argued that if the legislation was sought to be defended on the ground that it is a tax on activity like processing and would be covered by the A I Cal powers enumerated under entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule then it was submitted that there was no charging section for such an A activity and as such the charge must fail and there cannot be any levy This argument proceeds on an entire misconception It stipulates the levy and charge of duty of excise on all excisable goods produced or manufactured Manufactured under the Act after the amendment would be the manufacture as amended in section and Tariff item I and and the charge would be on that basis Therefore it is difficult to appreciate the argument that the levy would fail as there will be no appropriate charging section or machinery for effectuating the levy on the activity like the method of processing even if such an activity can be justified under entry of List I of Seventh Schedule We are therefore of the opinion that there is no substance in this contention As mentioned hereinbefore under each of these points several authorities were cited but in the view we have taken on principles which are well settled it is not necessary to multiply these authorities The validity of the impugned Act was challenged on the ground that by giving retrospective effect unreasonable restrictions have been imposed on the petitioners fundamental rights under Articles and of the Constitution In the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and others <ORG> it was held that fabric as used in the tariff description cotton fabric would refer to something that was woven hence it could relate only to cloth in the grey stage processing of the grey cloth either by bleaching dyeing or printing did not amount to manufacturing as both before and after processing it remained a fabric falling within the same item of <ORG> Tariff Item cotton fabrics of the First Schedule to the <ORG>s and Salt Act After the pronouncement of the above judgment several writ petitions were filed in various courts Furthermore it was made clear that in so far as past assessments were concerned refund of excise duties to manufactures as ordered by <ORG> would have only meant a fortuitous windfall so as to benefit such persons without any relief to the ultimate consumers who had purchased the fabrics and had borne the burden of the duties It has therefore to be borne in mind that the petitioners have already paid excise duty demanded of them from time to time and the present petitioners have gathered the duties from the consumers It is also well settled that by itself would not be unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business There is no particular feature of this legislation which can be said to create any unreasonable restriction upon the petitioners The <ORG> has been extremely reluctant to over ride the legislative judgment as to the necessity for retrospective taxation not only because of the paramount governmental interest in obtaining adequate revenues but also because taxes are not in the nature of a penalty or a contractual obligation but rather a means of apportioning the costs of government amount those who benefit from it The impugned legislation does not act harshly nor there is any scope for arbitrariness or discrimination It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that they are carrying on only the processing activity and the wholesale cash price is not theirs on the entire product Where for the purpose of calculating assessable profits a notional and conventional sum is laid down by the legislature to be arrived at on a certain basis it is not permissible for the courts to engraft into it any other deduction or allowance or addition or read it down on the score that the said deduction or allowance or addition was authorised elsewhere in the Act or in the Rules The circumstances that thereby the benefit of any exemption granted by the legislature may be lost and that in some cases hardship might result are not matters which would influence courts on the construction of the statute A tax payer subject is entitled only to such benefit as is granted by the legislature And in this case there is no hardship When the textile fabrics are subjected to the processes like bleaching dyeing and printing etc by independent processes whether on their own account or on job charges basis the value of the purposes of assessment under section of the Central Excise Act will not be the processing charges alone but the intrinsic value of the processed fabrics which is the price at which such fabrics are sold for the first time A in the wholesale market The value would naturally include the value of grey fabrics supplied to the independent processors for the processing However excise duty if any paid on the grey fabrics will be given proforma credit to the independent processors to be utilised for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance with the Rules A or of the Central Excise Rules as the case may be Read in that context and in the context of the prevalent practice followed so long until the decision of <ORG> in Real Honest case there is no hardship and no injustice to the petitioners or the manufacturers of grey fabrics The conclusion that inevitably follows that in view of the amendment made in section of the Central Excises Salt Act as well as the substitution of new Item I and Item Excise Tariff in place of the original items the contentions of the petitioners cannot be accepted In this view of the matter we are of the opinion that the views expressed by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> Good deal of arguments were canvassed before us for variation or vacation of the interim orders passed in these cases Different courts sometimes pass different orders as the courts think fit It is a matter of common knowledge that the interim orders passed by particular courts on certain consideration are not precedents for other cases may be on similar facts An argument is being built up now a days that once an interim order has been passed by this court on certain factors specially in fiscal matters in subsequent matters on more or less similar facts there should not be a different order passed nor should there be any variation with that kind of interim order passed Every Bench hearing a matter on the facts and circumstances of each case should have the right to grant interim orders on such terms as it considers fit and proper and if it had granted interim order at one stage it should have right to vary or alter such interim orders In that view of the matter as we said before if we may venture to suggest for consideration by our learned brothren that this <ORG> should refrain from passing any interim orders staying the realisations of indirect taxes or passing such orders which have the effect of non realisation of indirect taxes
