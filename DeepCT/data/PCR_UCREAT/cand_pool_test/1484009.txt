<NAME> had further agreed that he would give a sub lease to the assessee for the term of years as and when he would get a regular lease from the Government and it appears that on th October <NAME> gave a sub lease to the assessee of the said plot at a rental of Rs per month The other terms agreed to between the parties are as mentioned in annexure A to the statement of case It is not necessary to refer to all of them but it may be mentioned that it was agreed that the payment of of the gross annual income would only be made in the years profits are made In the year when there was no profit that year would not be counted towards the years period mentioned in the agreement The theatre and the building were completed before st April and the assessee started his business on st April The assessee desired certain variations in the matter of exercising the option given to him by the aforesaid clause of the agreement made on June and therefore on th March he addressed a letter to <NAME> the material part of which is in the following terms As I desire to leave my affairs as clear as possible for my son may I request you to consider whether you would not allow the operation of this clause of capital payment exactly as it is stated to be to take place not merely in the event of sale of <ORG> but also otherwise at may option any time within the next twelve months According to him the amount agreed to be paid by the assessee to <NAME> would clearly be an expenditure of a preliminary nature incurred for establishing the business of <ORG> and not for the purpose of acquiring buildings machinery etc The assessee took three appeals for the said three assessment years against the orders of the Income tax Officer to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner He took the view that a part of the said amount of Rs he allocated as payments made for and in connection with the acquisition of i cinema theatre building ii residential building iii exhibition machinery and iv air conditioning machinery In this view of the matter he allowed the appeal partially and remanded the case to the Income tax Officer directing him to modify the assessment in the light of the observation made by him in his order The <ORG> accepted the first contention of the department and has allowed the appeals set aside the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and restored that of the Income tax Officer We will deal with the contentions raised by Mr <NAME> in due course On an application made by the assessee under sub section of section of the Act the <ORG> has drawn up a statement of a case and referred to this court the following question of law Whether the appropriate part of Rs For these reasons we reframe the question in the following terms to bring out the controversy between the parties arising out of the order of the <ORG> Whether any part of the amount of Rs Mr <NAME> on the other hand raised three contentions In support of his contention he referred us to certain rules farmed under proviso a to section vi Before we proceed to deal with the contentions raised by counsel for the parties it will be convenient to consider the relevant provisions of section Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely written down value means a in the case of assets acquired in the previous year the actual cost to the assessee in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under this Act or any Act repealed thereby or under executive orders issued when the Indian Income tax Act II of was in force These provisions indicate that in the computation of the tax payable by an assessee under the head Profits and gains of the business profession vocation the assessee is entitled to certain deductions by way of certain allowances and one of the allowances is depreciation allowance in respect of buildings machinery plant and furniture which is the property of the assessee and which he has used for the purpose of his business during the assessment year In determining the written down value of the assets acquired in the previous year it is the actual cost to the assessee and in the case of the assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost less the depreciation actually allowed Depreciation allowance as understood in the commercial world is deduction from profits which a businessman ordinarily makes with a view to making good the capital investment which spooner or later will have to be replaced on account of the wear and tear of the assets during the course of the business In our opinion therefore the meaning of the expression actual cost to the assessee as used in sub section of section of the Act would be what the assessee his in fact expended or laid out for the purpose of acquiring the depreciable assets The genuineness of the agreement remunerating <NAME> for rendering help in these and other matters has not been challenged and there is nothing to hold that the remuneration paid to <NAME> was not a legitimate remuneration In these circumstances we see no reason why a portion of the remuneration that is attributable to the help assistance and services rendered by <NAME> in the acquisition of the depreciable assets should not be included in the cost of the depreciable assets That portion in our view is liable to be included in the cost of these depreciable assets to the assessee and this brings us to the second contention raised by Mr <NAME> In support Mr <NAME> has referred us to proviso a to clause vi of sub section of section which provides that to entitle an assessee to claim depreciation allowance he has to furnish particulars in the prescribed form According to Mr <NAME> written down value in column is the expenditure incurred by the assessee in acquiring the depreciable assets at the time of the commencement of the business and according to him column shows that to that amount the assessee can claim to add only the capital expenditure incurred by him in making any additions alterations improvements and extensions during the assessment year It is not possible to read in column that the written down value mentioned therein restricted only to the expenditure incurred by the assessee before the commencement of the business in acquiring the assets We have already referred to the definition of written down value contained in clauses a and of sub section of section of the Act and that definition would show that the written down value of the assets acquired during the previous year is the actual cost to the assessee and in the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less the depreciation actually allowed The limit to which the Income tax Officer can go back does not stop at the written down value of the previous year but extends up to the figure of the original cost and the method enjoined by section is not that the Income tax Officer should merely scale down the written down value of the previous year but that he should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary take also into consideration the allowances granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the written down value for the assessment year with which he is concerned Mr <NAME> however tried to distinguish these cases on the ground that these cases related to a correction of a mistake in the matter of determination of the original cost at the commencement of the business and therefore the observations would have application only to such cases where the Income tax Officer is required to amend or correct the amount of the original cost determined at the commencement of the year on the ground of a mistake We are unable to read any such limitation in the rule laid down by their Lordships in the aforesaid observations In that case the assessee entered into an agreement with an oil company by which she sold to the company acres of her land The question arose whether the amount paid to her by way of royalty was income or part payment of the instalments of the price of the land sold by her and it was held by their Lordships of <ORG> that the share of the oil reserved to the assessee was not a royalty in the ordinary sense familiar in the case of mining leases but was in effect payment by instalments of part of the price of the price of the lands which she had sold to the company It was therefore not income but a capital receipt and the amount paid to the assessee was not taxable in her hands If Mr <NAME> contention is accepted in cases where depreciable assets are purchased not at a fixed price but on percentage basis of gross returns of the business the assessee would not be entitled to claim any depreciation at all in any year because the price payable would get determined at the end of the year or years and naturally therefore would not be an amount expended or a liability incurred for a certain amount by an assessee at the commencement of the year for acquisition of the assets attributable towards the acquisition of the depreciable assets as would be hereafter determined should be included in the actual cost of these assets to the assessee in the year or years of account at the commencement of which the liability to pay it or part thereof had accrued or would accrue It may be stated that Mr <NAME> contended before us that the entire amount which would be determined should be included in the original cost for the assessment year because the liability to pay it accrued prior to st March and therefore it has to be taken into account in that year while on the other hand it is the contention of Mr <NAME> that the agreement is of th July much after the expiry of the previous year it was payable in instalments and therefore the amount if any ascertained cannot be included in the assessment year The Commissioner shall pay the costs of the assessee in this reference Question answered in the affirmative
