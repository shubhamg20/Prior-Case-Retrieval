HEADNOTE The appellant company carried on land developing business and sold land after development on a profit Appeal from the judgment and order dated June of <ORG> in I No of of the Constitution read with A of the Indian Income tax Act raises the question as to whether the appellant as entitled to a deduction of Rs The Income tax Officer disallowed that claim on the ground that the expenses had not been actually incurred in the year of account and also on the ground that the estimate had not been proved to be based on a consideration of the real expenses which the Company would have to incur for the purpose The Appellate Assistant Commissioner on appeal confirmed the disallowance by the I on the ground that there was as yet no accrued liability and on the further ground that as the development would be carried out in the future the expenditure estimated at current prices could not be allowed The appellant thereafter made an application before the <ORG> requiring it to refer to <ORG> under of the Income tax Act certain questions of law arising out of its order But even if such was the case there is hardly any justification for the <ORG> failing to realise it least what facts were required to be found and stated On an application made by the appellant however <ORG> granted the requisite certificate under Art The question which really arises for our determination in this appeal is whether having regard to the fact that the appellant method of accounting viz as disallowed by all the authorities below was that the expenditure was not actually incurred in the year of account it was by no means certain what the actual cost would be when the developments are carried out and that there was as yet no accrued liability but only a contingent liability undertaken by the appellant even though the undertaking was incorporated in the deeds of sale themselves The following were the developments undertaken to be carried out by the appellant as appears from the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner There was a condition in the Conveyance deeds that the appellant does hereby covenant with the purchaser that the appellant shall complete the construction of roads drains provide suitable pucca surface drains on both sides of the roads and shall also make arrangements for lighting up the said roads and shall maintain the said roads drains lights till the same are taken over by the Municipal Besides provision for roads drains etc he Deed provides for filling of low lands and there is a clause in the Conveyance Deed which shows that the appellant shall at his own cost fi II This undertaking having been incorporated in the deeds of sale themselves there was certainly a liability undertaken by the appellant to carry out these developments within six months from the dates of those deeds That however did not absolve it in any manner whatever from carrying out the undertaking and the purchasers were in a position to enforce the undertaking by taking appropriate proceedings in that behalf Reliance was placed on behalf of the <ORG> on the case of <ORG> <NAME> Inspector of Taxes in which a distinction was drawn between an actual i legal liability which is deductible and a liability which is future or contingent and for which no deduction can be made The cost of replacement was admittedly a proper deduction in computing profits as was also any sum paid to a factory owner in settlement of the value of shortages on termination of the contract A liability the amount of which is deductible for income tax purposes is one which is actually existing at the time of making the deduction and is distinct from the type of liability accruing in <ORG> <NAME> lnspector of Taxes which although allowable on accountancy principles is not deductible for the purpose of income tax There is no doubt that the undertaking to carry out the developments within six months from the dates of the deeds of sale was incorporated therein and that undertaking was unconditional the appellant binding itself absolutely to carry out the same That it can be so done is illustrated by <ORG> <NAME> Inspector of Taxes where a particular asset which could not be immediately realised in a commercial sense was valued in money for income tax Purposes in the year of its receipt and it was observed by Viscount Simon It seems to me that it is not correct to say that an asset such as this block of shares cannot be valued in money for income tax purposes in the A Supposing for example the contract conferring the asset on the taxpayer included a stipulation that the asset should not be realized by the transferee for five years and that if an attempt was made to realise it before that time the property in it should revert to the transferor As in the case of assets received during the accounting year which could not be immediately realized in a commercial sense so in the case of liabilities which have already accrued during the accounting year though they may not have to be discharged till a later date Since the whole amount was actually received in the year of account before and without making the promised expenditure no question of allowing a deduction of any expenditure from such receipts of the year arises If then the estimated expenses which would have to be incurred in duly discharging that liability which was undertaken by the appellant and was incorporated in the deeds of sale could be deducted in accordance with the mercantile system of accounting adopted by the appellant and accepted by the I is there anything in the Income tax Act which would prevent this debit being allowed as a deduction in the computation of the profits and gains of the appellant business The appellant had it appears claimed this deduction as and by way of expenditure wholly laid out for the purposes of its business under xv of the Income tax Act assessed in respect of the profits and gains of its business and the profits and gains of the business cannot be determined unless and until he expenses or the obligations which have been incurred are set off against the receipt The expression profits and gains has to be understood in its commercial sense and there can be no computation of such profits and gains until the expenditure which is necessary for the purpose of earning the receipts is deducted therefrom whether the expenditure is actually incurred or the liability in respect thereof has accrued even though it may have to be discharged at some future date As was observed by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> The duty is to be charged upon I a sum not less than the full amount of the balance of the profits or gains of the trade manufacture adventure or concern and it appears to me that that language implies that for the purpose of arriving at the balance of profits all that expenditure which is necessary for the purposes of earning the receipts must be deducted otherwise you do not arrive at the balance of profits indeed otherwise you do not ascertain and cannot ascertain whether there is such a thing as profit or not That seems to me to be the meaning of the word profits in relation to any trade or business Unless and until you have ascertained that there is such a balance nothing exists to which the name profits can properly be applied These are no doubt observations from the English cases dealing with English statutes of Income tax but the general principles which can he deduced therefrom App determined by the method of making the statutory deductions from the receipts and any deduction from the business receipts if it was to be allowed must be brought under one or the other of the deductions mentioned in and that there was no scope for any preliminary deduction under general principles If that is established then the deduction must be allowed provided of course there is no prohibition against it express or implied in the Act represented the estimated amount which would have to be expended by the appellant in the course of carrying on its business and was incidental to the same and having regard to the accepted commercial practice and trading principles was a deduction which if there was no specific provision for it under section of the Act was certainly allowable deduction in arriving at the profits and gains of the business of the appellant under section of the Act there being no prohibition against it express or implied in the Act was wrong and it should have answered the referred question in the affirmative We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and answer the referred question in the affirmative
