Whether the <ORG> is right in holding that in the instant case due to the contribution of capital by the trust the funds of the trust was invested in a concern and that such investment exceeded five per cent We shall briefly state the facts leading to these references The trust was one registered under Section A and its income was exempted from payment of tax under Section up to and inclusive of the assessment year The Commissioner took the view that the delayed withdrawal of the share of profits due for the accounting year ending on March on July and August amounted to investment of the funds of the trust in the firm <ORG> in which persons referred to in Sub section of Section had a substantial interest The assessee challenged this order in appeal before the <ORG> This appeal was heard along with the assessee appeal for and they were disposed of by the consolidated order annexure out of which the four questions mentioned earlier have been referred for the opinion of this court But this did not avail the assessee for the year where the <ORG> specifically raised the further plea that the contribution of capital by the assessee trust in <ORG> was investment in a concern in which the persons referred to in Sub section of Section had a substantial interest and therefore Section precluded any exemption of the assessee income But the <ORG> did not apply this ratio for the year for the reason that the Commissioner of Income tax had set aside the order of assessment only on the sole ground of delayed withdrawal of the share of profits and it was not open to the <ORG> to sustain it on other grounds Now coming to the common question which arises for both the years Section provides inter alia that income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes shall not be included in the total income of the person in receipt of the income There is no dispute that the trust in question is one wholly for charitable purposes We are concerned with Sub clause ii of Clause of Sub section of the section which provides that nothing contained in Section shall operate to exempt the income of a trust for religious or charitable purposes if any part of the income or any property of the trust is during the previous year used or applied directly or indirectly for the benefit of any person referred to in Sub section There is no dispute that the other two partners of <ORG> are those referred to in Sub section It contains eight Clauses a to of which we are concerned with Clause only It provides that the income or the property of a trust shall be deemed to have been used or applied for the benefit of a person referred to in Sub section if any funds of the trust are or continue to remain invested for any period during the previous year in any concern in which any person referred to in Sub section has a substantial interest We may also refer to Sub section which provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Clause of Sub section in a case where the aggregate of the funds of the trust invested in a concern in which a person referred to in Sub section had a substantial interest did not exceed five per cent of the capital of that concern the exemption under Section shall not be denied in relation to any income other than the income arising to the trust from such investment by reason only that the funds of the trust have been invested in a concern in which such person had a substantial interest This argument need not detain us long because in our view the crucial ingredient for Clause of Sub section of Section to apply is an investment of the funds of the trust in a concern of the nature mentioned Moreover we shall deal with the point in brief though we do not find any substance in this contention of the <ORG> In that context the court observed at page In the gross receipts of a business day after day or from transaction to transaction lies embedded or dormant profit or loss on such dormant profit or loss undoubtedly taxable profits if any of the business will be computed If profits accrue to the assessee directly from the business the question whether they accrue de die in diem or at the close of the year of account has at best an academic significance but when upon ascertainment of profits the right of a person to a share therein is determined the question assumes practical importance for it is only on the right to receive profits or income profits accrue to that person If there is no right no profits will be deemed to have accrued The court then went on to observe at page In the case of a partnership where by a covenant binding between the partners the accounts are to be made at stated intervals the right of a partner to demand his share of the profits does not arise until the contingency which by operation of law or under a covenant of the partnership deed gives rise to that right has arisen This is for the reason that it could not be said at any given point of time during the accounting period that there is any profit liable to be divided between the partners the fortunes of the firm fluctuating at different times We are therefore of the opinion that the profits of a partnership accrue to a partner when he gets the right to demand the same either under the provisions of the agreement between the parties or in their absence under the provisions of the Partnership Act At this stage we must refer if only for the purpose of rejection to a contention raised by standing counsel for the <ORG> that the word invested in Clause is not of any significance as according to him all that is required is that any funds of the trust continued to remain in any concern whether it was an investment or not An investment popularly means every application of money which is intended to fetch a return by way of interest income or profit This only employed as capital in a business is money invested in business After referring to various decisions on the point the court observed at page From the above it is clear that in order to constitute an investment the moneys must be laid out in such a manner as to acquire some species of properties which would bring an income to the investor The <ORG> was justified in setting aside the order of the Commissioner of Income tax under Section denying such exemption to the assessee The <ORG> had overruled this plea on the ground that the Commissioner of Income tax had set aside the order of assessment only on the ground that delayed withdrawal of the profits by the assessee constituted investment The court held at page The jurisdiction vested in the Commissioner under Section of the Act is of a special nature or in other words the Commissioner has the exclusive jurisdiction under the Act to revise the order of the Income tax Officer if he considers that any order passed by him was erroneous in so far as it was prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> If after hearing the assessee in pursuance of the notice issued by him under Section of the Act he is not satisfied he may pass the necessary orders Feeling aggrieved therefrom the assessee may file an appeal against the same as provided under Section of the Act In case he proceeds thereunder after hearing the assessee in pursuance of the notice given by him then the appeal filed by the assessee under Section of the Act cannot be treated on the same footing as an appeal against the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner passed in assessment proceedings where both the parties have been given the right of appeal In this view of the matter the argument raised on behalf of the <ORG> that in appeal the <ORG> may uphold the order appealed against on grounds other than those taken by the Commissioner in his order is not tenable Under Section of the Act it is only the Commissioner who has been authorised to proceed in the matter and therefore it is his satisfaction according to which he may pass necessary orders thereunder in accordance with law In this situation the <ORG> while hearing an appeal filed by the assessee cannot substitute the grounds which the Commissioner himself did not think proper to form the basis of his order In entertaining an appeal from the Commissioner order what the <ORG> does is to examine whether the said order is sustainable in law and whether it is within the powers conferred by Section Even otherwise the question whether there was an investment of the funds of the trust in this case during any part of the previous year is basically a question of fact on which the Commissioner had not rendered any finding for the year We now come to the year Thereunder the exemption under Section will be denied if any funds of the trust are invested during any period of the previous year in any concern in which a person referred to in Sub section had substantial interest Before dealing with the other points raised we shall refer to a subsidiary contention that the investment contemplated by Clause is an investment which will generate an income by itself without any other effort and not income earned by any business activity carried on with the aid of the money invested Apart from the inability of this court to read words into the section which are not there which is part of the legislative and not judicial process we are of the opinion that the words any concern are comprehensive and embrace every concern which satisfy the qualification of being one in which any person referred to in Sub section has a substantial interest The question of applying liberal or strict rules of construction as laid down in certain decisions relied on by either side will arise only if there is any ambiguity which requires to be resolved Therefore we hold that any concern in Clause refers also to a concern in which the trust is a partner provided it is one in which any person referred to in Sub section has a substantial interest and the funds of the trust are or continue to remain invested in that concern during any period of the previous year We cannot therefore accept the contentions of the assessee regarding the applicability of Section to cases where the trust contributes capital to a firm of which it is a partner The decision rendered by us in Income tax References Nos to of for the year must govern Income tax Reference No of also where the facts are parallel with the Income tax Officer exempting the income of the assessee under Section for the year the Commissioner of Income tax setting aside the said order under Section of the Act on the ground of alleged delayed withdrawal of the assessee share of profits from the two firms <ORG> and <ORG> and the <ORG> in turn setting aside the order of the Commissioner on precisely the same grounds as those in the case of <ORG>
