DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> KANIA CITATION SCR SCC JT SCALE ACT Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Sections Coal slurry escaping from coal mine washery Deposited on river bed and Raiyati land Lease for disposal thereof Competence of <ORG> Gov ernment Non framing of Rules by Central Government Whether confers legislative competence on <ORG> Extent of executive power in the execution of lease Coal slurry Whether constitutes mineral The first two appellants filed Writ Petitions before <ORG> challenging the <ORG> Government action in leasing out the right to the Respondent for removing the slurry It also held that collection of slurry did not involve any mining opera tions and the settlement made by the <ORG> Government in favour of the respondents was not a mining lease and so the <ORG> Government was not under any legal obligation to obtain previous sanction of <ORG> under the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act It further held that after the slurry escaped into the river bed or to some other land it ceased to belong to the appel lants and the <ORG> Government was entitled to execute the lease for collection of the slurry The Writ Petitions filed by the Contractors before <ORG> were dismissed by a Single Judge who held that the third appellnat company was the owner of the slurry and the <ORG> Government had no authority to grant any lease to the respondent contractorS for removal of the same On appeal by the contractors the Division Bench held that the lease granted by the <ORG> of Bihar in favour of the contractors was not a mining lease and the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act were not applicable to the grant of lease to collect the same but if the slurry settled down on other land the respondents have right to remove the same On behalf of the appellants it was inter alia contended that the slurry sludge was in substance coal a mineral specified in the First schedule to the Act that the <ORG> Government had no authority in law to grant any lease to the respondents for the collection removal Or lifting of the slurry coal deposited in the river bed or on any Raiyati land without obtaining the sanction of <ORG> under Section of the Act that the deposit of the slurry in the river bed and the land was by natural process of flow of water discharged from the washeries that there was no law made by the <ORG> authorising the <ORG> Government to interfere with the appellants property right by way of executive orders that slurry discharged from the washeries of the appellants coal mines constituted waste and effluent of coal mines its disposal was exclu sively within the legislative compe tence of the <ORG> and that in view of <ORG> declaration under Section read with Sections and of the Act the <ORG> Government was denuded of all its legislative competence to make any law with regard to dis posal of waste or effluent discharge of coal mines and hence the <ORG> Government had no executive power to deal with the same There is no doubt that in the instant cases slurry is coal slurry as admittedly small particles of coal escape from the washery plant alongwith water By Section of the Act <ORG> has declared that it is expedient in public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided in the Act In view of <ORG>ary declaration as made in section of the Act the <ORG> is denuded of its legislative power to make any law with re spect to the regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent as provided by the Act The Act further provides that <ORG> has exclusive power to frame any rule either under Section or under the amended Section of the Act regulating disposal of slurry As a result of the declaration made by the <ORG> under Section of the Act The Central Government has not framed any rule either under Section or under Section of the Act Section confers general power on <ORG> to frame rules and to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India Section does not affect or restrict the generality or width of legislative power under Section I as the matters specified in var ious sub clauses of Section are illustrative in na ture Power to frame rules regulating the discharge or disposal of slime or slurry emanating from a coal mine including its collection from the river bed or from Raiyati land after its escape from the washery of the coal mines Section which ex pressly confers power on <ORG> to regulate disposal or discharge of waste of a mine makes <ORG>ary declaration apparent that the <ORG> is not competent to regulate waste discharge of a coal mine Mere absence of any rule framed by <ORG> under Sections or of the Act with regard to the dis posal of slime or waste of a coal mine does not confer legislative competence on the <ORG> to make any law or rule Once a particular topic of legislation is covered by the <ORG>ary declaration the <ORG> is denuded of its power to make any law or rule in respect of that topic or subject matter and the absence of Rules would not confer legislative competence on the <ORG> there is no scope for the contention that until rules are framed the <ORG> has power to make law or rules on the subject does not confer power on the <ORG> to make law on the subject the <ORG> is denuded of its power of making any law with regard to those mailers If the <ORG> has power to enact laws on a matter enumerated in the <ORG> List or in the concurrent list the <ORG> has executive power to deal with those mat ters subject to other provisions of the Constitution In the absence of any law the <ORG> Government or its officers in exercise of executive authority cannot infringe citizens rights merely because the <ORG> has power to make laws with regard to subject in respect of which the executive power is exercised No doubt under Entry of List I the <ORG> has power to make law but that power is subject to Entry of List with respect to the regulation and development of mines and minerals Since <ORG> power to make law with respect to the matter enumerated in Entry of List II has been taken away by the <ORG>ary declaration the <ORG> Government ceased to have any executive power in the matter relating to regulation of mines and mineral development If <ORG> and the <ORG> both have power to make law in a matter the executive power of the <ORG> shall be subject to the law made by the <ORG> or restricted by the execu tive power of the <ORG> expressly conferred on it by the Constitution or any law made by <ORG> Since <ORG> has made the law as contemplated by Entry of List I and the law so made confers exclusive power on <ORG> to frame rules regulating the disposal of waste or industrial effluent of a mine the <ORG> has therefore no power either to make law under Entry of List II or to exercise executive power to regulate the disposal of slurry a waste effluent discharge of a coal mine The inclusive definition of mine as contained in Section of the Act is wide enough to include any premises belonging to a mine where any ancillary process is carried on for preparing the minerals or coke for sale sale is an integral part of a mine as it involves ancillary process In view of the <ORG>ary declaration made by Section of the Act and having regard to Section of the Act the <ORG> Government has no authority in law to make any settlement or grant any lease to any person for the collection of slurry deposits either from the river bed or other land A This <ORG> directed that the money deposited pursuant to the interim orders passed by the High <ORG> and this <ORG> will be paid to the successful party The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In these appeals a common question of law is involved whether the State of Bihar had legal authority to execute leases in favour of the respondents for collection of slurry on payment of royalty to it Since the question involved in these appeals are common the same are being disposed of by a common judgment The appellant claimed that plot No which formed part of river bed of Damodar belonged to it having been acquired under the Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition Development Act for the purpose of mining of coal The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging <ORG> action in granting lease to respondent No for lifting slurry from the fiber bed on the ground that the property belonged to the appellant company and <ORG> had no authority in law to grant a mining lease without the prior approval of <ORG> under Section of the Mines and Mineral Regulation and Development Act There is no dispute that large area of land in the District of Hazari Bagh and Dhanbad have been settled with the appellant company for purposes of mining operations and the company enjoys mineral rights in respect of the surface and sub soil It is not necessary to refer to the historical facts relating to the acquisition of mining rights by the appellant as there is no dispute that under Section of the Bihar Land Reforms Act the appellant existing mining leases became statutory leases in the <ORG> of Bihar The appellant has been claiming right that the slurry which escaped from the washery belonged to it and no other person had right to collect the same The appellant filed two writ petitions before <ORG> challenging the authority of <ORG> action on the ground that slurry was a mineral being coal and as such its collection or mining was regulated by the provisions of the Mines and Mineral Regulation and Develop ment Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and <ORG> had no authority to grant any lease for collection of sludge slurry without the previous sanction of <ORG> Thereupon the respondents contractors filed writ petitions before <ORG> for quashing the criminal case registered against them and also for the issue of a direction permitting them to collect slurry under the lease granted to them by the State of Bihar Before <ORG> the appellants herein contended that the slurry belonged to them and the State of Bihar had no authority in law to grant any lease in respect of the same A learned single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petitions on the findings that the appellants herein are the owner of the slurry and <ORG> had no authority to grant any lease to the respondent contractors for removal of the same On appeal by the contractors <ORG> of <ORG> vide its judgment AIR Calcutta held that the lease granted by the State of Bihar in favour of the contractors was not a mining lease and the provisions of the Act were not applicable to the grant of lease On the question of appellants claim to the property rights for collecting slurry the Bench held that the slurry deposited on the appellant land belonged to them and the respondents had no right to collect the same but if the slurry settled down on other land the respond ents have right to remove the same from the river bed The main question which falls for consideration is whether the State of Bihar has authority to grant lease settlement to the respondents for collection lifting of coal slurry deposited in the river bed or on any other land after its escape from the appellants washeries Before <ORG> the appellants contended that in view of the provisions of the Act the State of Bihar had no authority to grant any lease regarding collection of slurry without the prior approval of <ORG> The appellants further pleaded before <ORG> that since slurry after its escape from their washeries settled down in their own land it continued to be their property and the State of Bihar had no authority to grant lease for collection of the same from their land With regard to the appellants claim of ownership of the slurry deposited on the appellants land <ORG> did not decide the question on the ground that these issues involved disputed questions of fact which could properly be adjudicated in a civil suit The Bench further held that the lease granted by <ORG> in favour of the respondents for collecting the slurry did not confer any right in them for carrying out coal mining operation nor such right relates to winning or mining of coal The State Government had no authority in law to grant any lease to the respondents for the collection or removal or lifting of the slurry coal deposited in the river bed or on any Raiyati land without obtaining the sanction of <ORG> under Section of the Act There is no law made by <ORG> authorising <ORG> to interfere with the appellants property rights Since <ORG> is denuded of its legislative competence to make any law with regard to dis posal of waste or effluent discharge of coal mines <ORG> has no executive power to deal with the same On behalf of <ORG> it was further contended that once the slurry escaped from the washcry plants of the appellants it ceased to belong to them and as it polluted the river water and affected the fertili ty of Raiyati land <ORG> was justified in providing for its collection and removal to prevent pollu tion There is no dispute that coal is found in seams mixed with mud and other impurities Viewed in the light of the above meaning of slurry there is no doubt that in the instant cases slurry is coal slurry as admittedly small particles of coal escape from the washery plant alongwith water We agree with the view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra as in our opinion the slurry coal deposited in the river bed or land in substance as well as in its character continues to be coal He referred to the provisions of the Act and particularly to Sections and in support of his contention that in view of <ORG> Legislation <ORG> has no legislative competence to enact any law on the subject consequently <ORG> has no executive authority to deal with the disposal of slurry In order to appreciate this submission it is neces sary to consider the Constitutional provisions and the Act Articles and of the Constitution read with Seventh Schedule and the legislative lists therein prescribe the extent of legislative competence of <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule Similarly <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II <ORG> and <ORG> both have legislative power to make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in List III the Concurrent List Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest By of the Act the <ORG> has declared that it is expedient in public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided in the Act In view of <ORG>ary declaration as made in of the Act <ORG> is denuded of its legislative power to make any law with respect to the regu lation of mines and mineral development to the extent as provided by the Act Section of the Act defines various expressions occurring in the Act Sections to prescribe restrictions on undertaking prospecting and mining operations under licence or lease Section to prescribe procedure for obtaining prospecting licences or mining lease in respect of the land in which minerals vest in <ORG> Sections to provide for framing of rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences or mining leases In particular empowers the Central <ORG> to make rules for regulating the grant of pros pecting licences and mining leases in respect of minerals and for the purposes connected therewith Section lays down that rules may provide for all or any of the matters as enumerated under various clauses therein Clause of before its amendment by the Amending Act of conferred power on the Central <ORG> to frame rules for the disposal or discharge of any tailings slime or other waste products arising from any mining or metallurgical operations carried out in a mine This provision empowered the Central <ORG> to frame rules for the disposal of waste products or effluent discharge from mines including a coal mine Section empowers the State <ORG> to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases and other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and purposes connected there with Section confers special powers on Central <ORG> to undertake prospecting or mining opera tions in certain lands Sections to deal with miscel laneous matters Section provides for mineral development this Section prior to its amendment by the Amending Act of read as under Sec It shall be the duty of <ORG> to take such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India and for that purpose <ORG> by notification in the Official Gazette make such rules as it thinks fit It shall be the duty of <ORG> to take such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or mine opera tions and for such purpose <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make such rules as it thinks fit In addition to the general power to frame rules for the conservation of mineral Sec confers specific power for framing rules regulating disposal of waste of a mine reads as under In particular and without prejudice to the general ity of the foregoing power such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters namely the disposal or discharge of waste slime or tailing arising from any mining or metallurgical operations carried out in a mine Section confers express power on <ORG> for framing rules for the conservation and the development of mineral including the disposal or discharge of waste arising from any mining operations of a mine The Act further pro vides that <ORG> has exclusive power to frame any rule either or under the amended of the Act regulating disposal of slurry Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is ab stracted from the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legis lature Thus power to frame rules regulating the dis charge or disposal of slime or slurry emanating from a coal mine including its collection from the river bed or from Raiyati land after its escape from the washery of the coal mines would clearly fail within the expression conserva tion of mineral Section which expressly confers power on <ORG> to regu late disposal or discharge of waste of a mine makes the Parliamentary declaration apparent that <ORG> is not competent to regulate waste discharge of a coal mine Mere absence of any rule framed by <ORG> under ss or of the Act with regard to the dis posal of slime or waste of a coal mine does not confer legislative competence on <ORG> to make any law or rule Once a particular topic of legislation is covered by the Parliamentary declaration <ORG> is denuded of its power to make any law or rule in respect of that topic or subject matter and the absence of Rules would not confer legislative competence on the <ORG> this Court held In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that required is a declaration by <ORG> that it was expedi ent in the public interest to take the regulation of devel opment of mines under the control of the <ORG> Since Section of the Act covers the field with respect to disposal of waste of a mine there is no scope for the contention that until rules are framed <ORG> has power to make law or rules on the subject Mere absence of rules framed by <ORG> does not confer power on <ORG> to make law on the subject Since the legislative field with regard to the framing of rules relating to the disposal of slime and waste of coal mine is fully covered by <ORG> is denuded of its power of making any law with regard to those matters Learned counsel for the appellants contended that since Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule confers legislative power on <ORG> for making laws regulating mines and minerals <ORG> in the absence of any rule made by <ORG> has power to regulate disposal and collection of slur ry Article prescribes the extent of executive power of the <ORG> it lays down that the executive power of a <ORG> shall extend to the matters with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws If <ORG> has power to enact laws on a matter enumerated in the <ORG> List or in the Concurrent List the <ORG> has executive power to deal with those matters subject to other provisions of the Constitution In the absence of any law <ORG> or its officers in exercise of executive authority cannot infringe citizens fights merely because <ORG> has power to make laws with regard to subject in respect of which the executive power is exer cised As discussed earlier <ORG> is denuded of its power to make laws on the subject in view of Entry of List I and the <ORG> declaration made under Section of the Act Since <ORG> Legislature power to make law with re spect to the matter enumerated in Entry of List has been taken away by the <ORG> declaration <ORG> ceased to have any executive power in the matter relating to regulation of mines and mineral development It lays down that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a <ORG> and <ORG> have power to make laws the executive power of <ORG> shall be subject to limitation of the executive power expressly conferred by the Constitution or by any law made by <ORG> upon the <ORG> or authority thereof If <ORG> and the <ORG> Legisla ture both have power to make law in a matter the executive power of the <ORG> shall be subject to the law made by the <ORG> or restricted by the executive power of the <ORG> expressly conferred on it by the Constitution or any law made by <ORG> <ORG> has made the law as contem plated by Entry of List I and the law so made confers exclusive power on <ORG> to frame rules regulating the disposal of waste or industrial effluent of a mine <ORG> has therefore no power either to make law under Entry of List II or to exercise execu tive power to regulate the disposal of slurry a waste effluent discharge of a coal mine We find no merit in the submission The expression mine is not defined by the Act instead Section says that the expression mine has the same meaning as assigned to it in the Mines Act There is no dispute between the parties that the coal as extracted from the coal mine is crushed into pieces and thereafter it is washed to remove its impurities and ash contents to make the coal fit for sale After the coal is washed it assumes the form of coke which is sold to consum ers The washery wherein the process of washing coal is carried on for the purpose of preparing the coal for sale is an integral part of a mine as it involves ancillary process We are there fore of the opinion that in view of the admitted case of the parties disposal of sludge slurry coming out from the wash eries of appellants coal mines is covered by the Act and <ORG> had no authority in law to grant any lease or settlement authorising collection of the same from the five bed or from any other land Consequently the respondents in whose favour settlements have been made by <ORG> have no right to authority to collect sludge slurry either from the five bed or from any other land Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant urged that <ORG> committed serious error as there was no scope for any dispute regarding the question of ownership of Plot No We find force in his submission There is suffi cient material on record to show that <ORG> is the owner of the plot No situated at village Sudamdih and the respondents have failed to place any mate rial before the court that the appellant is not owner of Plot No By another Notifica tion dated August issued under Section of the Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Devel opment Act <ORG> declared its inten tion to acquire the lands measuring acres specified in Schedule A to the Notification Sudamdih village was mentioned in the Schedule By another Notification dated December <ORG> declared under Section of the Coal Beating Areas Acquisition and Devel opment Act that the land measuring acres de scribed in Schedule A and the rights to mine quarry bore dig and search for win work and carry away minerals in the lands measuring acres described in Schedule are acquired We further hold that in view of the Parliamentary declaration made by Section of the Act and having regard to Section of the Act <ORG> has no authority in law to make any settlement or grant any lease to any person for the collec tion of slurry deposits either from the river bed or other land We further direct that the money deposited pursuant to the interim orders passed by <ORG> and this <ORG> will be paid to the successful party
