Five persons namely <NAME> the father of defendants to in the suite <NAME> the first defendant <NAME> the first plaintiff <NAME> the father of plaintiffs to and <NAME> the fifth plaintiff entered into an agreement that each of them should offer bids at the auction and if the sale was confirmed in favour of any one or more of them all the five should enjoy the profit or bear the loss thereof according to particular shares It was inter alia provided in the deed that the two managing partners should consult the remaining partners and act according to the majority in case a sum exceeding Rs On th November the Collector sanctioned renewal of the lease in the names of the existing lessees in respect of the areas held by them if they accepted the terms and conditions of the draft lease prepared by the department was due by him to the firm There was a reference to a settlement of account arrived at on st January A demand was made to agree to settle profits and losses for the period from st January upto st December after verifying the accounts There was no reference whatever in this notice Ex This reply was dated th December and on th January the suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the fifth plaintiff along with <NAME> as the first plaintiff and the sons of <NAME> as plaintiffs to Besides defendants to other defendants were added as pro forma defendants as persons who might have an interest in the benefits of the partnership indirectly originally prayed for the following reliefs a For a declaration that the defendants to have forfeited their rights in the suit partnership and For a declaration that the suit partnership is continuing and that the renewal of the salt lease contained in the names of defendants to for a further period of years is one of the assets of the said partnership enuring to the benefit of the partnership and For an injunction restraining defendants to from carrying on the salt works or salt business independently of

suit partnership terminated or legally dissolved by virtue of any construction put on the partnership agreement dated th March and therefore not possible to grant the aforesaid reliefs the plaintiffs pray that It be declared that the renewal of the suit lease obtained in the names of defendants to for a further period of years is also an asset of the suit partnership concern and A general account of all the assets and liabilities and all the profits arising from the partner ship from its beginning be directed to be taken and defendants to be directed to pay deliver and distribute to the plaintiffs their share of the profits and assets that may be found due and payable on taking such accounts and That defendants to be further restrained by a permanent injunction from carrying on the partnership salt works or business or similar salt works or business and from using any of the partnership assets material and utilities such as the salt works trollies channels and other facilities and business connections established or created for salt manufacture with partnership funds in the pans described in the A schedule in such business and from using the goodwill of the firm and the firm name <ORG> Lessees of Badjanapara The contesting defendants to raised several pleas in defence some of which have been found to be obviously untenable such as for instance the plea that there was no partnership at all To this end the managing partners made necessary application and trials using the goodwill of the partnership There was never any attempt on the part of these defendants to obtain any wrongful gain to themselves that the suit must be treated as one for settlement of accounts of a dissolved partnership and accounts had to be settled on the footing that it became dissolved on st December that there was no settlement of accounts on st January as alleged by defendants to that the renewal of the lease was not obtained in virtue of the goodwill of the partnership and that otherwise the goodwill of the old firm may be sold for what it was worth in the realisation of the assets of the dissolved firm For the appellants Mr <NAME> their learned Counsel rested their case on two alternative grounds that the application made by the defendants to for a renewal of the expiring lease was made on behalf of and for the benefit of all the partners in pursuance of a resolution and therefore the grant of the lease must enure for the benefit of all the partners and that the new lease was obtained by defendants to as partners or co owners by availing themselves of their character and position as such and therefore they must hold for the benefit of all the partners and co owners the advantage so gained by them There is very little evidence bearing on the first part of the appellants case There is no documentary evidence on record of any resolution of the partners deputing defendants to to apply on behalf of the partnership for a renewal of the lease had been used and there were several pages still left blank We have no hesitation in holding that the case of a specific resolution having been passed by all the partners that defendants to should apply for a renewal of the lease was an after thought for which there is no support in the oral or documentary evidence in the case Otherwise the plaintiffs would certainly have made their individual attempt to obtain a lease at an auction or otherwise But as the evidence now stands it appears clear to us that the application by defendants to was made without the knowledge and therefore without the consent of the other partners The plaintiffs therefore can lay any claim to the new lease only on a legal basis which their learned Counsel found in Section and Section of the Trusts Act which embody the general equitable principles established by course of decisions in England There is no substantial divergence in the principles applicable to the case between the law in England and the law in India Upon the same principle if a person possessing only a partial interest in a lease as a tenant for life mortgagee or partner renews the term upon his own account he shall hold it for the benefit of all parties interested in the old lease They run thus Section Where a trustee executor partner agent director of a company legal adviser or other person bound in a fiduciary character to protect the interests of another person by availing himself of his character gains for himself any pecuniary advantage or where any person so bound enters into any dealings under circumstances in which his own interests are or may be adverse to those of such other person and thereby gains for himself a pecuniary advantage he must hold for the benefit of such other person the advantage so gained Section Where a tenant for life co owner mortgagee or other qualified owner of any property by availing himself of his position as such gains an advantage in derogation of the rights of the other persons interested in the property or where any such owner as representing all persons interested in such property gains any advantage he must hold for the benefit of all persons so interested the advantage so gained but subject to repayment by such persons of their due share of the expenses properly incurred and to an indemnity by the same persons against liabilities properly contracted in gaining such advantage Thereupon <NAME> commenced an action which was tried before Sir <NAME> Several contentions were raised on behalf of the plaintiffs for example that the partnership could not be dissolved without notice as stipulated in the original deed of partnership and that the notice of dissolution was not sufficient The learned Judge also held that the circumstance that the representative of <ORG> estate was unwilling to admit the plaintiff into the agreement for renewal would not make any difference It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to the new lease as part of the partnership property Cranworth tersely summed up the legal position thus If the property of the partnership consists in part of leaseholds the representative of the deceased partner may treat the survivor as a trustee and if the survivor renews the lease he is considered to do so for the benefit of the partnership The learned Lord Justice was not prepared to say that in no case could a partner during the continuance of the partnership contract for a new lease to be granted to himself without the new lease being held to be for the benefit of the partnership In order to give validity to such a transaction all the parties ought to be placed upon an equal footing arid it is difficult to see how this is to be accomplished in the case of managing partners In re did not relate to partners there is a full discussion by the learned Judges of <ORG> of general principles which would also apply to partners <NAME> drew the distinction already adverted to between a presumption of law which arises in the case of a trustee and a rebuttable presumption of fact in the case of mortgagees joint tenants and partners He said There may well be and often is an advantage for the purpose of obtaining a new lease in being in the position of an old lessee and that advantage may be of appreciable value in the view of a <ORG> administering equity even though the landlord is under no obligation to grant a new lease to the old tenant He dealt with the case of partners thus Take next the case of a partner obtaining a renewal of a partnership lease And therefore as a rule even if a partnership lease has come to an end yet if that partner by virtue of his position obtains a renewed lease he will be held to have acquired it on behalf of all the partners Only in some cases the person who obtains the renewal is allowed and in others he is not allowed to show that there is in the particular circumstances nothing inequitable in his claiming the renewed lease for his own benefit The only Indian decision to which reference was made at length by both sides was a ruling of a Division <ORG>ench of this <ORG> in <CIT<ORG>TION> Early in October <ORG> sent a notice to <ORG> asserting that the new lease was his own and asking him to come and settle the accounts of the partnership which according to him was terminated on th October that is the date of the termination of the old lease The learned Judges held that <ORG> was not entitled to claim an interest in the new lease or to insist that it should be treated as part of the assets of the old partnership <N<ORG>ME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG>ench discussed the leading authorities in England and observed that the statute law in India had not substantially deviated from the rules of the English law In his opinion there was no absolute rule of law or irrebuttable presumption in respect of the renewal of a partnership lease by one of the partners and in India a constructive trust can be held to arise only if the conditions of Section or Section of the Trusts <ORG>ct were satisfied There was also nothing in the evidence to suggest that <ORG> was in the position of a managing partner In the state of authorities discussed above it may be conceded that there is no irrebuttable presumption of law that a renewal of a lease belonging to the partnership by one of the partners enures to the benefit of all the partners It would depend upon the facts and circumstances in each case Section of the Trusts Act consists of two parts of the partnership moneys were with defendans to the Government adopted a policy of renewing old leases if their working had been satisfactory and no notice was given to the other partners of the application for renewal Though the defendants to raised a plea that accounts had been settled in January the plea was found to be false at the trial and there was no attempt to revive that plea before us There is no evidence that defendants to informed the other partners of their desire to obtain a new lease for their own individual benefit He referred us to Clause of Ex it is recited that there was an agreement prior to the auction by <ORG> that even if the sale was confirmed in favour of anyone of the five individuals all should enjoy the profit or bear the losses thereof according to the shares mentioned therein Section of the Madras Salt Act runs thus For the purposes of this Act the licencee shall be taken to be the owner of the licence and of the salt works specified therein provided that nothing herein contained shall affect the liability of the licencee towards any person who may have an interest in or lien upon such licence or salt works It was next contended by the learned Advocate General that the partnership was for a fixed term namely the period of the old lease and it was for a single venture and as the new lease was to commence only on st January that is after the cessation of the partnership it could not become the asset of the old partnership The fact that the renewed lease would commence after the termination of the partnership cannot make any difference so far as the application of this doctrine is concerned if the renewal was obtained either during the partnership or before its assets have been sold There were similar facts in <NAME> <NAME> Mac The learned Advocate General tried to escape from the terms of Section of the Trusts Act by arguing that defendants to did not avail themselves of their position as partners but that they availed themselves only of their position as licensees The question therefore remains what is the relief which the plaintiffs can obtain with respect to the new lease Apart from the fact that they will not be entitled to the profits made on its account to the making of which they have not contributed in any manner there is another fact which introduces a complication namely that the lease cannot be sold as other assets of the partnership can be Appropriate directions were therefore given to the Master to set a value on the offices after making a reasonable allowance for conducting the business of the same In conclusion we hold that the new lease obtained by defendants to in renewal of the old lease which formed the subject matter of the partnership must be held by them for the benefit of the other members of the partnership who are entitled to share in the advantage gained by defendants to In arriving at a value the liability of defendants I to to furnish capital and incur the necessary expenses for carrying on the new business with its attendant risks and also possibilities of profits are factors to be taken into account The appeal is allowed to this extent The contesting respondents will pay the appellants the costs of this appeal There is no necessity to interfere with it
