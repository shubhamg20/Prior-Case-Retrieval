The <NAME> land was given to the <ORG>logical garden in In this eight acres of land there are some old buildings and the vacant land was used for fodder cultivation for raising flower nursery as a sumping ground for huge garbages and as burial ground for dead animals On September and November there were two notes by the Secretary of <ORG> to the effect that the <ORG> was interested in a property known as the Hastings House Properly and that the <ORG> who considered the Hastings House properly unsuitable may be offered four acres out of the eight acres of <NAME> land It was stated that though <ORG> had suggested that Salt Lake was a better place for establishing a <ORG> there was no demand for a <ORG> in that area and the request for a hotel in Salt Lake was confined to <ORG> right from the beginning wrote to the Secretary of <ORG> stating his objections to the proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel Reference was also made to the report of <ORG> and it was noted that the projected profitability of the venture to the government was expected to be high Pursuant to the letter dated January possession was given to <ORG> on January Five petitioners a Trade Unionist two life members of the <ORG> two other bonafide residents of Greater Calcutta all lovers of wild life filed a petition in public interest on Initially the relief sought was primarily to restrain the <ORG> authorities from giving effect to the two Resolutions dated January and January to hand over the four acres to the <ORG> Department of the Government iv the hotel was not the only tall building since there existed many such residential buildings to which none raised an objection and that <ORG> are also constructing one such tall building and the lessee and their experts on wild life had assured them that in any case adequate precaution would be taken in regard to illumination of the hotel and the layout of the surrounding so that no disturbance would be caused to the flight path of the birds or animals A learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition holding that <ORG> did not show any lack of awareness of the problem of environment ecology in granting the lease of land The pro posed hotel is a Garden hotel and there is perhaps every chance of the ecology and environment improving as a result of planting numerous trees all around the proposed hotel and the removal of the burial ground and dumping ground for rubbish In this letter the Chief Minister pointed out that there were already in existence a number of multistoreyed buildings all around the <ORG>logical Garden but there was no report that they had any adverse effect on the migratory birds or the animals He further assured her that he had himself gone thoroughly in to the project with the special reference to the possible impact on the birds and the environment and had satisfied himself that project would not cause any disturbance to the birds or their free movement He mentioned that Dr <NAME> a renowned ornithol ogist had also been consulted by <ORG> and he had also confirmed that a feet building would not inter fere with the landing or climbing out of the birds from the lake The proposition that a decision must be arrived at after taking into account all relevant considerations eschewing all irrelevant considerations cannot for a moment be doubted There was no failure to observe the principles of Natural Justice The Public Undertak ings <ORG> in its report discussed the matter and invit ed the Government attention to various factors The two letters dated and pertaining to the grant relating to the transfer of land to the east of Belvedere Road known as <NAME> land in produced from old official records are public documents within the meaning of the Evidence Act The land which was undoubtedly government land was given to the <ORG>logical Garden upon the terms set out in the two letters The Act has nothing whatever to do with the vesting of any property in the parks There is in fact no provision which deal with the vesting of property in a park Section enables the <ORG> Government to extend by a notification the boundaries of a park but that can only be for the purposes of the Act and not for the purpose of vesting or creating any title in a property <ORG> owned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of he execu tive One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is consid ered necessary to dispose of a property is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule but then the reasons for the departure must be rational and should not be suggestive of discrimination In the present case no one has come forward alleging that he has been discriminated against and his fundamental right to carry on business had been affected Negotiations with those who had come forward with proposals to construct <ORG>s was without doubt the most reasonable and rational way of proceeding in the matter rather than inviting tenders or holding public auction There was nothing discriminatory in the procedure adopted since no other leading hotlier had shown any inclination to come forward The nett sales method appears to be fairly well known method adopted in similar situations It is only when courts are apprised of gross viola tion of fundamental rights by a group or a class action or when basic human rights are invaded or when there are complaints of such acts as shock the judicial conscience that the courts especially this <ORG> should leave aside procedural shackles and hear such petitions and extend its jurisdiction under all available provisions for remedying the hardships and miseries of the needy the under dog and the neglected from the land allotted to them to the <ORG> A Regarding the commercial and financial aspects of the lease also there is nothing secretive The method adopted is the nett sales method of calculating the compen sation paid which is a well known method adopted in such situations like the one here namely lease of land by the Government The following Judgments of the Court were delivered CHINNAPPA REDDY We grant special leave and proceed to dispose of the appeal There is no quite place in the white man cities But in your perishing you will shine brightly fired by the strength of the God who brought you to this land and for some special purpose gave you dominion over this land and over the red man If man is able to transform deserts into cases he is also leaving behind deserts in the place of cases Each victory it is true in the first place brings about the results we expect ed but in the second and third places it has quite differ ent unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first The question raised in the present case is whether <ORG> has shown such lack of awareness of the problem of environment in making an allotment of land for the construction of a Five Star Hotel at the expense of the zoological garden that it warrants interference by this <ORG> Obviously if the Government is alive to the various considerations requiring thought and deliberation and has arrived at a conscious decision after taking them into account it may not be for this <ORG> to interfere in the absence of mala fides A which proclaims it to be the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests lakes rivers and wild life and to have compassion for living creatures We may now proceed to examine the facts of the present case There are some old buildings and vacant land in the eight acre plot of land On September and November there were two notes by the Secretary of <ORG> to the effect that the <ORG> was interested in a property known as the Hastings House Property and that <ORG> who considered the Hastings House property unsuitable may be offered four acres out of the eight acres of <NAME> land It was stated that though <ORG> had suggest ed that Salt Lake was a better place for establishing a <ORG> Hotel there was no demand for a <ORG> Hotel in that area and the request for a hotel in Salt Lake was confined to <ORG> Originally this zoo was on the outskirts of the City but the City has grown in such a fashion that the zoo has vertually become the City Centre and there is hardly any scope for its expansion In view of the letter issued to the Zoologi cal Gardens Alipore and the <ORG> decision regarding the land of Begumbari Compound and in consideration of the assurance conveyed through <NAME> Chief Whip and Member that <ORG> will give to the Garden adjacent lands and matching grants for the purposes of shifting of the Depart ments of the Zoo within the said compound the members do not press their objections as contained in the resolution of the Managing Committee held on On June the Director of the Zoo wrote to the Secretary of <ORG> stating his objections to the Proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel It may be mentioned that this four acres of land proposed to be taken is the only area available there and it is presently covered by structures of hospital buildings <ORG> Operation Theatre Segregation Wards Quarantine areas post mortem room burial ground for dead animals Presumably as a consequence of the letter from the Director of the <ORG> there was a note by the Secretary <ORG> suggest ing the postponement of the implementation of the <ORG> decision till the necessary facilities then available at Begumbari land were shifted to other land of the same extent within a reasonable distance from the <ORG>logical Garden as these facilities were originally linked with the <ORG> Reference was also made to the report of <ORG> and it was noted that the projected profitability of the ventur to the <ORG> was expected to be high A copy of the sketch map is enclosed for ready reference It will also let this department have in consultation with and with the concurrence of <ORG> of this Government and <ORG> a plan and estimate for reconstruction of the aforesaid essential structures on the land adjacent to the land proposed to be leased out so that all these points are incorporated in the deed of lease between the said company and <ORG> in this <ORG> for the said land measuring four acres Pursuant to the letter dated January possession was given to <ORG> on January Ini tially the relief sought was primarily to restrain the <ORG> authorities from giving effect to the two resolutions dated January and January to hand over the four acres to <ORG> of the Government She drew the Chief Minister attention to the fact that apart from reduction in the already inadecu ate space for the <ORG>logical Garden construction of a Five Star Multystoreyed Building would disturb the inmates and adversely affect birds migration which was a great attrac tion There were already a large number of high rise residential buildings around the <ORG> No one had raised any objection when those building were constituted There was no report that the existing multistoreyed buildings had any adverse affect on the migratory birds or the animals He had again gone thoroughly into the project with special reference to its possible impact on the birds or environment and had also visited Calcutta in that connection He gave his reasons as follows The four acre plot assigned to <ORG> by <ORG> is not within the boundaries of the area belonging to the <ORG>logical Gardens but on the other side of Belvedere Road an important thoroughfare parallel to the main boundary of the zoo and some feet from the main part of the lake In taking a decision to take away the land from the <ORG> and to lease the same to <ORG> relevant considerations had been ignored and irrelevant considerations had been taken into account The decision of the Govern ment was also wrong as it was apparently based on some assumptions which had been made without inquiry and verifi cation If there was any decision on February in regard to leasing the <NAME> land it could at best to characterised as purely tentative and it could not by any stretch of imagination be called an irrevocable or irrevers ible decision in the sense that the <ORG> was powerless to revoke it or that it had created any rights in anyone so as to entitle that person to question any reversal of the tentative decision It was the suggestion for the All India Tourism Conference presided over by the Union Minister for Tourism that State <ORG> should make plots in good locations available at concession al rates for construction of hotels in order to promote the Tourist Industry We have no evidence or any immediate or subsequent public protest but there were certain objections from some circles The substance of the objection of <ORG> was that the facilities available in the <NAME> land would be left unprovided for if the land was given to the proposed hotel and agreed to the proposal on the assurance that adjacent land and matching grants would be given to the <ORG> There were inter departmental notings which we presume must also have been brought to the notice of the Chief Minister It is true that there is no reference to these matters in the second <ORG> Memorandum It was therefore thought that there was no need to mention the needs and interests of the <ORG> which were already well known and had also received consideration It was suggested that the <ORG> itself required to be expended and there was therefore no land which could be spared The land allotted to the hotel was as we have seen not used for the main purpose of the zoo and was not in fact part of the main <ORG>logical Garden This has been mentioned in the various notings made from time to time We have no doubt that the <ORG> was quite alive to the need for expan sion of the zoo when they decided to grant four acres of <NAME> land which was not used for the main purpose of the zoo for the construction of a <ORG> hotel In this letter the Chief Minister pointed out that there were already in existence a number of multistoreyed buildings all around the <ORG>logical Garden but there was no report that they had any adverse effect on the migratory birds or the animals He further assured her that he had himself gone thoroughly into the project with special reference to the possible impace on the birds and the environment and had satisfied himself that project would not caused any disturbance to the birds or their free movement He mentioned that Dr <NAME> a renowned ornithologist had also been consulted by <ORG> and he had also confirmed that a feet building would not interfere with the landing or climb ing out of the birds from the lake The learned counsel for the appellants drew our atten tion to a letter written by Dr <NAME> to the <ORG> dated August in which he disowned having made any statement to a press correspondent by name <NAME> that the hotel posed no threat at all to the migratory flight path Our attention was drawn by the learned counsel for appellants to the presence of two renowned experts at the meeting of <ORG> on September Bearing in mind the proper approach that we have to make when questions of ecology and environment are raised an approach which we have mentioned at the outset we are satisfied that the facts and circumstances brought out by the appellants do not justify an inference that the construction of the pro posed hotel in the Begumbari land would interfere in any manner with the animals in the Zoo and the birds arriving at the Zoo or otherwise disturb the ecology The proposed hotel is a Garden hotel and there is perhaps every chance of the ecology and environment improving as a result of planting numerous trees all around the proposed hotel and the removal of the burial ground and dumping ground for rubbish The submission was that neither the <ORG> memorandum of Janu ary nor the <ORG> Memorandum of September revealed that relevant considerations had been taken into account We do not agree with the submission of Dr <NAME> The proposition that a decision must be arrived at after taking into account all relevant considera tions The principle of <NAME> case has no application to the factual situation here It is impossible to agree with the submission that there was any failure to observe principles of Natural Justice We do not for a moment doubt the genuineness of the two documents which have been produced from old official records We are satisfied that for the purposes of the present case we will be justified in proceeding on the basis that the land which was undoubt edly <ORG> land to start with was given to <ORG> upon the terms set out in the two letters The further submission of Dr <NAME> was that whatever might have been the terms of the grant in favour of the Zoological Garden the Bengal Parks Act vested the land in favour of the Zoological Garden and there was no way by which the <ORG> could divest the Zoological Garden of the land except by a procedure known to the law such as acquisition or requisition The Act was made applicable to the public parks and gardens mentioned in the schedule Section enables the <ORG> to make rules for the management and preservation of any park and for regulating the use thereof by the public In particular the rules may regulate the admission into the park of persons animals and vehicles prohibit the causing of any manner of injury to the trees plants monuments furniture etc The Act has nothing whatever to do with the vesting of any property in the parks There is infact no provision which deals with the vesting of property in a park it does not mean that the land has become the property of the park it only means that the various things the doing of which is regulated or prohibited by the Act and the rules will not be done or will be regulated on the adjacent land also One of the arguments strenuously pressed by Dr <NAME> was that even if it was assumed that the <ORG> had the power to transfer the land the <ORG> did not have the power to deal with the land in any manner that they liked Certain norms and procedures had to be observed and nothing could be done which would result in loss to the public exchequer The Bengal Land Manual prescribed the procedure to be followed in the matter of transferring land belonging to the <ORG> Like similar volumes going by whatever name pub lished by the <ORG>s of <ORG> of other States the West Bengal Land Management Manual also is compendium of statutes and rules framed either by the <ORG> or by <ORG> pursuant to a statutory power conferred on them Orders issued by the <ORG> from time to time and Orders circulars instructions and memoranda issued by <ORG> from time to time The <ORG> or the <ORG> may have the power the amend these orders and instruc tions but nonetheless they must be obeyed so long as they are in force and are applicable In pursuing the socio economic objective is the <ORG> bound to invite tenders or held a public auction To answer this question we may refer to the cases cited at the <ORG> The Court held that the right to make offers being open to a limited class of persons it effectively shut out all other persons carrying on trade in Kendu leaves and also new entrants into that business It was therefore ex facie discriminatory and imposed unreasonable restric tions upon the right of persons other than existing contrac tors to carry on business It is to be seen that in the present case no one has come forward alleging that he has been discriminated against and his fundamental right to carry on business had been affected We have it in the record that the Oberoi Group of Hotels already had <ORG> in Calcutta while <ORG> were making their own Private negotiations and arrangements for establishing <ORG> <NAME> speaking for the Court observed that the activities of the <ORG> had a public element and if it entered into any contract it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure There was nothing discrminatory in the procedure adopted since no other lead ing hotlier had shown any inclination to come forward He proceeded to say The <ORG> therefore cannot for exam ple give a contract or sell or lease out its property for a considerations less than the highest that can be obtained for it unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so We have referred to those considerations only illustratively for there may be an infinite variety of con siderations which may have to be taken into account by the <ORG> in formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of various considerations which have weighed with the <ORG> in taking a particular action that the <ORG> would have to decide whether the action of the <ORG> is reasonable and in public interest But one basic principle which must guide the <ORG> in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the <ORG>al action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its valid ity to show that is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the <ORG> by proper and ade quate material The <ORG> cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the <ORG> is unreasonable or without public interest because as we said above there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the <ORG> in taking action and therefore the <ORG> would not strike down governmental action as invalid on this ground unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest This argument plausible though it may seem is fallacious because it does not take into account the policy of the state not to allow export of resin outside its territories but to allot in only for use in factories set up within the <ORG> The <ORG> may choose to do so if it thinks fit and in a given situation it may even turn to be advantageous for the <ORG> to do so but if any private party comes before the <ORG> and offers to set up an industry the <ORG> would not be commit ting breach of any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates with such party and agrees to provide resources and other facilities for the purpose of setting up the industry There was no explanation as to how they came to be chosen and what their status and standing in the trade were to justify the choice lakhs when there were people ready to purchase the land for Rs On a consideration of the relevant cases cited at the bar the following propositions may be taken as well estab lished State owned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is considered necessary to dispose of a property is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule but then the reasons for the depar ture must be rational and should not be suggestive of dis crimination We do not think that there is any basis for any genuine criticism The nett sales method appears to be a fairly well known method adopted in similar situations In the result the judgments of the learned single judge and <ORG> of <ORG> are affirmed and the appeal is dismissed But after hearing the lengthy arguments advanced I ask myself the question whether this exercise could not have been avoided However before this <ORG> there are only two petitioners the st and the nd in the writ petition I fully agree with his conclusions They have suffered sufficient loss and the <ORG> The <ORG> Government has produced before me the original files including those containing the notes and <ORG> Memorandum for my inspection the facts which I shall set out herein are gathered from these records and files produced before me though most of them do not find place in the affidavits The two portions of Judgment extracted above show that things one the petitioners did not take any steps to get the matter heard expeditiously after they obtained an interim order to get all the work stopped two that the State Government made available to the <ORG> all the materi als to prove that its decision was taken after mature con sideration at all levels The matter was taken in appeal from the land allotted to them to the <ORG> Regarding the commercial and financial aspects of the lease also there is nothing secretive though they came in for sharp criticism at the hands of the appellants before us This is a fairly well known method adopted in such situations Here we do not have a case again sale of a <ORG> property It is only when courts are apprised of gross violation of fundamental rights by a group or a class action or when basic human rights are invaded or when there are complaints of such acts as shock the judicial conscience that the courts especially this <ORG> should leave aside procedural shackles and hear such petitions and extend its jurisdiction under all available provisions for remedying the hardships and miseries of the needy the under dog and the neglected It was faintly suggested by the <ORG> counsel that the first petitioner does not represent all the maz doors
