Against their conviction and sentence the appellants filed appeals in <ORG> The sentence of fine and imprisonment in lieu thereof as imposed by the trial court was however maintained By special leave they have filed these appeals For facility of reference we may mention that against the judgment of <ORG> in CC No appeals were filed in <ORG> by appellants therein In respect of <ORG> appellants preferred criminal appeals in <ORG> against their conviction and sentence as recorded by the Special judge and those cases from the hatch of Criminal Appeal Nos etc There are one or two other Appeals Criminal Appeal involving slightly different factors and we shall deal with those also during the course of the judgment However in the light of the submissions made at the bar with a view to satisfy our judicial conscience we have examined some of the evidence led in the cases and in particular that evidence which appears to have principally influenced both the trial court and <ORG> to convict the appellants We may point out here that in all these cases there is no direct evidence available on the record connecting any of the appellants with the commission of the crime alleged against them There is no dispute that though the jungle clearance work was supposed to have been done in the matter only came to light through the call attention motion in <ORG> in and even then it was not till that any physical inspection of various sites was undertaken except some random checks made by PW <NAME> in With this general background we shall now take up for consideration each of the representative appeals as already observed In his report while dealing with jungle clearance work of the Kanpur Canal he stated While the necessity or otherwise for jungle clearance cannot be established at this distant date more so without inspections of the sites of works it appears that there was no justification for giving the above works on nomination He submitted his report to the Government of A and that the said act was done in pursuance of the agreement between you all who thereby committed an offence punishable under section of the Indian Penal Code and within my cognizance ii Secondly that you the above named A to A herein being the public servants employed as formerly Executive Engineers The appeals filed by the appellants except for reduction of the sentence was also dismissed by <ORG> In its order dismissing the appeals <ORG> opined i during the year We have heard learned counsel for the parties and examined some of the evidence relied upon by the courts below with a view to find out whether prosecution has established that no work of clearance of Prickly Pier jungle was done at all and the amount was misappropriated by preparing false documents From the evidence of PW Shri NVM Krishna Chief Engineer Investigation who had conducted the second inquiry we find that he admitted that he did not inspect any work under Kanpur Canal and that his observations as reflected in the report Ex were not applicable to any of the works on the Kanpur Canal The prosecution has led no evidence to show that after any work had been done for removal of prickly pier jungle on the banks of Kanpur canal and therefore from the evidence of PW it follows that some work of clearance of prickly pier jungle at the banks of Kanpur canal had been undertaken prior to the inspection of the site by the inspecting team So far as the prosecution case that false and fictitious records relating to the preparation of estimates allotment of work on nomination basis drawing up of the agreements and making payments is concerned we find that there are ample admissions available in the prosecution evidence itself by various witnesses to the effect that all the estimates and agreements including the data sheets for the estimates had been checked earlier and that no mistakes or irregularities had been found therein There is no material available on the record to support the above observations There is not an iota of evidence led by the prosecution to prove that no work at all was done for clearance of prickly pier jungle on the reach to mile on Kanpur Canal in As a matter of fact the prosecution has led evidence to show that some work had been done but it is alleged that payments had been made for excessive work There is therefore no acceptable material on the record from which a conclusive inference may be drawn to the effect that the measurements found recorded in the measurement book Ex We are unable to subscribe to the observation that there was no necessity of clearance of jungle over the said bank as the jungle could not damage any part of the canal and therefore the proposal for clearance of the jungle had been made with a dishonest intention of boosting up of the area and to draw more funds from the Government There is no evidence on the record to that effect and on the contrary the evidence of PW Shri <NAME> is to the effect that the depth of Kanpur Canal at the reach between to miles ranges from ft There was thus no acceptable material on the record to establish the existence of the rough stone inlet prior to or in when jungle clearance work was done and no adverse inference could have been drawn against the appellants on account of the existence of rough stone inlet on the left hank of the canal in The evidence on the record shows that jungle clearance work was taken up on urgent basis as maintenance of the canal to avoid breaches during the rainy season on account of the directions issued by the Superintending Engineer and the Chief Engineer in that behalf besides for clearing the jeep track shows that he had been issued specific orders to report to the <ORG> and assist the investigation agency PW was examined by the investigating officer after he had Submitted the report and his report forms a part of his statement recorded by <ORG> under Section Under these circumstances the observations contained in report Ex which technically and factually form a part of the statement of PW recorded during the investigation of the case by PW is hit by Section No statement made by any person to a police officer during the course of investigation can be used for any purpose at any enquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the time when such statement was made except for the purpose of contradicting a witness as provided under Section of the Evidence Act There is no material on the record to show that PW possessed any particular skill which entitled him to draw conclusions relevant to the matter entrusted to him by the investigating officer in a case based on circumstantial evidence the settled law is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature Moreover all the circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence The accused were put to face their trial on the following charges i That you the above named A to A herein and one Duggi Reddy deceased Superintending Engineer during the year conspired to float the work known as Clearing and uproot ing the jungle at North Mopur Large tank from to in Kovur Taluk Nellore District in violation of established rules under PWD Code with intent to cheat the Govt of A and that the said act was done in pursuance of the agreement between you all and thereby committed an offence punishable of the Indian Penal Code and within my cognizance Prosecution in support of its case examined witnesses while the appellants examined two in their defence Like the case of the appellants connected with <ORG> the case against the appellants herein is also based only on circumstantial evidence Reliance was placed on the statement of PWs and in support of the circumstances that no jungle clearance work was done and that the modus operandi adopted by appellants to give the work on nomination basis ignoring the codal provisions and instructions on the subject was only to cover the fraud committed by the appellants in connivance with the contractor The prosecution however has led no evidence to show that the jungle clearance work was undertaken departmentally in or that no jungle clearance was re quired to be undertaken in There is ample evidence on the record to show that jungle clearance work had been done in There is also no reliable evidence available on the record to show that work done was less than the work paid for as is alleged by the prosecution the courts below concluded that the appellants had committed the offence alleged against them The prosecution has in our opinion failed to establish the case against the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt on the reach to metres on Krakatur small tank and without execution of that work misappropriated an amount of Rs allegedly paid to the contractor <NAME> by cheque by entering into a criminal conspiracy with him We have already referred to the history of the case in the beginning of the judgment and need not repeat the same Following charges were framed by the learned Special Judge on That you above named A to A and one Duggi Reddy deceased A during the year conspired to float the work known as juliflora jungle clearance at Krakatur Small Tank situated at a distance of KM West of Krakatur in violation of the village rules under code with intent to cheat Government of Andhra Pradesh and that the said act was done in pursuance of the agreement between you all and you all thereby committed an offence punishable under Section of the Indian Penal Code and within my cognizance Secondly that you above named accused A to A being servants employed as former Executive Engineer Deputy Executive Engineer and Section Officer of Nellore North Division respectively during the period between at the work spot i Krakatur small Tank mentioned in charge No above by corrupt an illegal means in abuse of your official position as such public servants obtained for yourselves or for A and yourself pecuniary advantage to the extent of Rs Prosecution in support of its case examined witnesses besides relying upon a number of documents The accused on the other hand examined two witnesses in defence PW and PW who deposed that jungle clearance work had been done in were declared hostile nonetheless we find that the prosecution has led no other evidence to show that in fact no work had been done at the site in question PW <NAME> <NAME> and PW Shri <NAME> who had inquired into the matter before the case was entrusted to the <ORG> have categorically admitted at the trial that they had not visited the site in question at the time of conducting the inquiry <NAME> PW not only he did not visit the site in question but he did not even examine a single witness at the time of conducting inquiry relating to the work at the site It appears to us that the courts below like in the case arising out of <ORG> and <ORG> allowed suspicion to lake the place of proof to convict the appellants No evidence has been led by the prosecution to show the reaction of the department to the allegations made on the Floor of the House in itself We fail to understand as to why after the case had been entrusted to the <ORG> in itself they took no steps to visit the site and ascertain about the situation of the site till The prosecution witnesses have admitted that there were jungles of Juliflora on the bank in It would not even be possible to say whether there was any necessity for jungle clearance at that earlier point of time to say that in a disturbed revetment there is even otherwise the possibility of the growth of Juliflora But there is nothing on the record to show that it was so undertaken departmentally in the prosecution has failed lo establish its case against the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt also apply to these appeals with equal force Learned counsel also drew our attention to the report of inspection submitted by the Chief Engineer on according to which jungle clearance work had actually been done at the site and urged that this evidence completely demolished the prosecution case In the charge sheet and the charge framed against the appellant the name of the appellant has been given as the contractor who was alleged to be a co conspirator with the <ORG> and section officers to misappropriate government funds by receiving payment for doing no jungle clearance work The charge framed against the appellant was never amended and since the charge contained the name of the appellant as a co conspirator who is supposed to have been alloted the work but who did no work and yet received payment and shared it with his co accused we fail to see how it is open to the prosecution to now contend that the contractor is a fictitious person Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt either through direct or circumstantial evidence The courts below have apparently taken a superficial view of the matter and without considering the material on the record recorded the conviction of the appellant which cannot be sustained As a result of our above discussion of various representative appeal and which discussion equally applies to all the appeals filed in this court arising out of the judgment of <ORG> dated we find that the prosecution has not been able to establish beyond a reasonable doubt its case against any of the departmental officials that is the Engineers and section officers and consequently their appeals succeed and their conviction and sentence are set aside This takes us to one other aspect of the case Reference has been made both by the trial court and <ORG> to the codal provisions i A PWD code A Financial Code etc Learned counsel appearing for all the appellants also during the course or their arguments were unable to point out any error in those findings and according to them in the established facts and circumstances of the case the irregularities administrative lapses and violation of the codal provisions could only have resulted in a departmental action against the officials but criminal prosecution was not justified Their argument has force and appeals to us Since we have given the benefit of doubt to the accused persons department officials and acquitted them they may seek reinstatement in service However as we have agreed with the findings recorded by both the courts below with regard to the violation of the codal provisions and administrative lapses by the departmental officials it appears to us that a departmental enquiry may be justified but in this fact situation it would be an unnecessary exercise Learned counsel for the appellants have been heard by us at length and they were unable to assail the findings of the courts below regarding codal violations and administrative lapse which may have caused some loss to the exchequer also What then should be the course of action which should be followed in the facts and circumstances of the case While the officials deserve to be punished should we remit the matter to the department for awarding appropriate punishment or should we impose the punishment ourselves and close the chapter A court of equity must so act within the permissible limits so as to prevent injustice the meanwhile will get their pensionary benefits calculated on the basis of their continuous service but they shall be entitled to draw pension with effect from the date of this order only
