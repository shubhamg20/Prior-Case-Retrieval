Whether the proviso to Section of the Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act inserted by the Finance Act with effect from April shall apply to an assessment proceeding in respect of the assessment year is the question involved in this application The fact of the matter lies in a very narrow compass For the accounting year January to December the petitioner filed a return under the Act on August Dr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner firstly contended that Section of the Act is ultra vires the Constitution He submitted that the correct interpretation of Section is that if an assessee has paid the dues under the aforesaid account before the due date applicable to an assessee for furnishing the return of income under Section the assessee shall be entitled to deduction of that amount For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in Clause a or Clause of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in Section of the previous year being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the st day of April or any earlier assessment year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him If the section is literally interpreted the submission of Dr <NAME> must fail because it has been made clear therein that an assessee shall be entitled to claim deduction of such amount of sales tax provident fund etc It is not disputed that in terms of Section of the Bihar Finance Act a dealer is required to furnish a return of its transaction for each completed quarter on or before the end of the month following the end of the quarter and is also required to file an annual return for each year on or before July of the following year For the purpose of their income tax assessments they none the less claim the liability as deduction even as they take resort to legal action thus depriving the <ORG> of its dues while enjoying the benefit of non payment There was no dispute at the <ORG> that Section was introduced not to give any benefit of deduction to unscrupulous assessees Mr <NAME> submitted that the law as it stood on April shall have to be looked into and applied and any amendment made in Section which was not applicable to the assessment year from April to March cannot be looked into Let us read the original provisos introduced in Section by the Finance Act see ITR St Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in relation to any sum referred to in Clause a which is actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under Sub section of Section in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and the evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return Provided further that no deduction shall in respect of any sum referred to in Clause be allowed unless such sum has actually been paid during the previous year on or before the due date as defined in the Explanation below Clause va of Sub section of Section It will appear from the first proviso that an assessee was entitled to claim deduction on account of payment of tax if he has actually paid it on or before the due date applicable to his case for furnishing the return of income It will appear from the second proviso that an assessee was entitled to claim deduction on account of the provident fund etc The position under the second proviso is that an assessee may claim deduction on account of contribution to be made by him to provident fund etc So far as the insertion of the first proviso in Section in the Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill is concerned the following was stated ITR St Under the existing provisions of Section of the Income tax Act a deduction of any sum payable by way of tax duty cess or fee etc It will thus be noticed that it was found impossible for an assessee to comply with Section as it stood in the year and to make it workable amendments in Section were introduced The law therefore as it stands today is that if an assessee had paid the sales tax additional sales tax Central sales tax etc the assessee shall be entitled to claim deduction if the same has been paid on or before the due date The advantage of the amendment to Section will be available to the petitioner only if it is held that although the amendments were inserted after April the same shall apply to the cases in which the assessment year was In the Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill the following was stated about this Explanation ITR St Certain courts have interpreted the provisions of Section in a manner which may negate the very operation of this section The interpretation given to these words is that the amount payable in a particular year should also be statutorily payable under the relevant statute in the same year In <NAME> <NAME> AIR SC <ORG> considered the scope and ambit of the proviso and the Explanation We have already noticed above that in the Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill Explanation was stated to be an interpretation clause The interpretation given to the words actually paid in the provisos is different from their literal interpretation From what has been stated hereinbefore it is absolutely clear that the first proviso to Section of the Act inserted by the Finance Act was enacted in order to suppress the mischief and for the purpose of giving relief to an assessee who is not an unscrupulous dealer The said Act further is explanatory in nature and thus had to be enacted for the purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a former statute and thus the same would relate back to the time when the prior Act was passed See Dursley Inhabitants English Reports Comp Cas SC SCC it was held as follows Interpretation must depend on the text and the context One may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual With this knowledge the statute must be read first as a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context With those glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and every thing is in its place Explanation appended to Section of the Act does not control the proviso thereto In <ORG> ITR Kar it was held that Section was not violative of Article of the Constitution and it does not unreasonably interfere with the freedom of trade and business guaranteed under Article of the Constitution It was held in that case that not only should the liability to pay the tax or duty be incurred in the accounting year but the amount also should be statutorily payable in the accounting year under the relevant Sales Tax Act and other relevant Acts It may be mentioned that the petitioner preferred an appeal against the order of assessment and the appellate authority taking note of the fact that the matter is pending consideration in this court allowed the said appeal and remitted the matter to the assessing authority with a direction to abide by the result of this writ application
