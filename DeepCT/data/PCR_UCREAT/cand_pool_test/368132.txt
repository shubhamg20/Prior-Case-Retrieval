The <ORG> by reason of its order dated inter alia found the said claim to be not sustainable on the ground that the loss was not covered by the said policy stating It appears to us that while preparing the insurance agreement the insurer was aware of the fact that this could be the easiest way for any Jeweller to raise claims against the insurance companies and that is why this clause has been deliberately introduced and theft by customer if any has been put in exclusive clause of the policy <ORG> as indicated hereinbefore by reason of its judgment and order dated did not agree therewith There was no entrustment on the part of the owner to the customer A short question which thus arises for our consideration is as to whether clause of the policy is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case Clause of the contract of insurance would be attracted only where the offences specified therein are committed by any of the persons mentioned therein Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or willfully suffers any other person so to do commits criminal breach of trust The word entrust would imply giving responsibility to a person upon whom the owner has confidence There was thus no occasion for the respondent to entrust the jewellery to him Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has relied upon the meaning of the word entrust as contained in Black Law Dictionary th Edn Apart from the fact that the said meaning of the term entrustment goes against the submission Mr <NAME> we may notice that in Black Law Dictionary the word entrusting in commercial law has been described as The transfer of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that type and who may in turn transfer the goods and all rights to them to a purchaser in the ordinary course of business by <NAME> at page it is stated Words in context The above generality is not applicable when it is clear from the context that the words are not used in a colloquial popular sense It has also been held that the phrase sum actually paid in a reinsurance agreement referred to a sum which the reinsured is merely liable to pay as the agreement read as a whole was against liability rather than actual payment The positive part deals with criminal misappropriation or conversion of the property and the negative part consists of dishonestly using or disposing of the property in violation of any direction and of law or any contract touching the discharge of trust It may have different implications in different contexts When a person misappropriates to his own use the property that does not belong to him the misappropriation is dishonest even though there was an intention to restore it at some future point of time We in the facts and circumstances of this case also direct the appellant to pay and bear the cost of the respondent throughout Counsel fee in this appeal is assessed at Rs
