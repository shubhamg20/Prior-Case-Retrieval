Punjab Excise Act of Ss and and Punjab Liquor Licence Rules Rules and Levy of fixed fee and additional fee on persons holding licences for sale of foreign liquor if illegal Those licences were granted to them on acceptance of their bids in the auctions held by <ORG> <ORG> The <ORG> Government demanded the payment threatened to cancel the licences granted to the appellants and declared its intention to resell the vends at the risk of the appellants On August the appellants filed their writ petition in <ORG> On the main contention that the levy in the shape of licence fee was unconstitutional <ORG> held that licences granted for regulating trade in intoxicating liquors stand in a class by themselves and that the consideration which governs licence fees charged in return for services rendered cannot apply to licences issued to the successful bidders at auctions of liquor vends and a and of the Constitution it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the Financial Com missioner has no power to frame rules so as to authorise the grant of liquor licences by holding auctions under of the Punjab Excise Act the Financial Commissioner has no right to authorise the levy or collection of any amount which strictly is not a fee an auction bid for fixing fees is a contradiction in terms The licence fee bears no relationship with the services rendered to the licensees and is therefore not fee in the true sense Nor can the licence fee be justified as an excise duty as it is not levied on the manufacture or pro duction of liquor The real character of the levy imposed on licensees through the medium of auctions is that it is in the nature of a tax and the Financial Commissioner who is an independent statutory authority having powers which are distinct and different from those of the Government has no authority to impose the tax nor indeed has <ORG> the power to impose such a tax The Government cannot under a contract impose a levy which it has no power to impose by law The new terms and conditions of auctions are basically and in substance similar to those which were struck down by <ORG> in <NAME> case which decision was affirmed in appeal by <ORG> The respondents raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the appellants and to the grant of reliefs claimed by them on the ground that such of the appellants who offered their bids in the auctions did so with a full knowledge of the terms and conditions attaching to the auctions and they cannot by their writ petitions be permitted to wriggle out of the contractual obligations arising out of the acceptance of their bids The con ditions of auction became the terms of the contract and it is on those terms that licences are granted to the successful bidders in Form A of the Rules Those who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along with its benefits Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon whether a contracting party finds if prudent to abide by the terms of the contract By such a test no contract could ever have a binding force Just as country liquor contractors offered bids voluntarily on terms and conditions governing the auctions the appellants in Civil Appeals Nos and of who hold licences in Form Nos and for the retail vend of foreign liquor voluntarily applied for and accepted the licences knowing fully well that the Financial Commissioner had the power to frame rules governing the licences There is no fundamental right to do trade or business in intoxicants The <ORG> under its regulatory powers has the right to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants its manufacture storage export import sale and possession and need bear no quid pro quo to the services rendered to the licensees iv As the amount payable by the licensees on the basis of the bids offered by them in auction and on the basis of Fixed and Assessed Fees is neither a fee in the technical sense nor a tax but is in the nature of the price of a privilege there is no question of the Financial Commissioner lacking power to organize auctions so as to authorize the recovery of any amount which is not a fee properly so called The amendments having come into force before April would govern the appellants licences and they are therefore liable to pay the fixed fees under the amended rules Those licences were granted to them on acceptance of their bids in the auctions held by <ORG> <ORG> Following an earlier judgment in <NAME> vs State of Punjab Civil Writ No of decided on February <ORG> took the view that the licence fee realised through the medium of auctions was really in the nature of still head duty and that licences could not be called upon by the Government to pay still head duty on the liquor quota which under the terms of auctions they were bound to lift but which in fact was not lifted by them The conditions governing auctions were notified through announcements made at the time of auctions shall be granted subject to the provisions of the Punjab Excise Act of hereinafter called the Act and the rules framed thereunder Clause iii of Condition authorises the Collector to resell the vend if the successful bidder fails to deposit the security or refuses to accept the licence In the event of such resale any deficiency in the licence fee is recoverable from the defaulter in the manner laid down in section of the Act which provides by clauses a and that an excise revenue and all amounts due to the Government on account of any contract relating to the excise revenue may be recovered from the person liable to pay the same by any process for the recovery of arrears of land revenue <ORG> demanded the payment threatened to cancel the licences granted to the appellants and declared its intention to resell the vends a the risk of the appellants On August the appellants filed their writ petition in <ORG> and Haryana Though several contentions factual and legal were raised in the petitions the appellants restricted their challenge in <ORG> to the following points The Excise and Taxation Commissioner who in the Punjab exercised the powers of a Financial Commissioner under the Act had no jurisdiction to determine the method of disposal of the country liquor vends The power conferred on the Financial Commissioner under section of the Act to grant a license permit or pass on payment of such fees if any as he may direct did not extend to disposing of the country liquor vends by auction The impugned auctions conducted under the amended Rule on the basis of estimated quota in proof litres was in substance founded on the same system which had been struck down by <ORG> in <NAME> case where it was held that the levy imposed through the medium of auctions was a tax and not a licence fee The State Government alone was competent to impose a tax or an excise duty under the Act that power could not be delegated to the Financial Commissioner or any other officer Section of the Act which empowered the Financial Commissioner to levy fees was not a charging section but if it is construed as containing a delegation to him of the power of the state to levy taxes no guidelines were laid down and thus the delegation was excessive The fee which could be imposed by the Financial Commissioner under Section of the Act could only be justified if it had a reasonable relation to the services rendered to the licensees It held that <ORG> was competent to regulate the business of vending intoxicating liquors that various provisions of the Act showed that the State Government had the exclusive right to manufacture or sell intoxicants that the Financial Commissioner had the jurisdiction to determine the method of disposal of country liquor vends that the rules under which the impugned auctions were held are substantially different from those under which the auctions challenged in <NAME> case were held that section of the Act is not an instance of delegated legislation and that the fixation of the maximum price of country liquor was a part of the power to regulate the trade in liquor On the main contention that the levy in the shape of licence fee was unconstitutional <ORG> held that licences granted for regulating trade in intoxicating liquors stand in a class by themselves and that the consideration which governs licence fees charged in return for services rendered cannot apply to licences issued to the successful bidders at auctions of liquor vends The Financial Commissioner has no power to frame rules so as to authorise the grant of liquor licences by holding auctions The licence fee bears no relationship with the services rendered to the licensees and is therefore not a fee in the true sense The real character of the levy imposed on licensees through the medium of auctions is that it is in the nature of a tax and the Financial Commissioner who is an independent statutory authority having powers which are distinct and different from those of the <ORG> has no authority to impose the tax nor indeed has the State <ORG> the power to impose such a tax The Government cannot under a contract impose a levy which it has no power to impose by law The new terms and conditions of auctions are basically and in substance similar to those which were struck down by <ORG> in <NAME> case and which decision was affirmed in appeal by <ORG> and Learned counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the appellants and to the grant of reliefs claimed by them Those who contract With open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along With its benefits By such a test no contract could ever have a binding force the appellant who was removed from the manager ship of certain evacuee properties filed a petition in <ORG> under Article of the Constitution praying for a writ of mandamus against the Deputy Custodian and others There was some discussion before us as to whether Fundamental Rights could be waived and in answer to the preliminary contention of he respondents it was urged on behalf of the appellants that they are entitled to enforce their fundamental rights no matter whether they agreed to waive those rights while entering into contracts with the Government The writ petitions filed by the appellants in <ORG> are wholly directed to showing that the Financial Commissioner lacked the power to grant liquor licences through auctions and to levy through the medium of auctions a sum which was not a fee in the strict sense of the term The two reliefs which the appellants asked for in the writ petitions are that the auctions held by the <ORG> for granting liquor licences and the bids offered therein by the prospective licensees should be quashed and secondly that a direction should be issued to the respondents restraining them from enforcing the obligations arising under the bids The appellants objected to the preliminary contention of the respondents on the ground that in their counter affidavit filed in <ORG> respondents had not pleaded that there was any contract between the parties or that the writ jurisdiction of <ORG> was inappropriate for the enforcement of contractual rights I further submit that the petitioners voluntarily and of their own free volition offered themselves as bidders at the time of auction It is thus clear that in <ORG> the respondents had raised the contention which is taken before us by their counsel in the form of a preliminary objection On the preliminary objection it was fin ally urged by the appellants that the objection was misconceived because there was in fact no contract between the parties and therefore they were not attempting to enforce any contractual rights or to wriggle out of contractual obligations The conditions of auction become the terms of the contract and it is on those terms that licences are granted to the successful bidders in Form A of the Rules Section of the Act confers power on the Financial Commissioner to make rules prescribing the scale of fees in respect of any licence Just as country liquor contractors offered bids voluntarily on terms and conditions governing the auctions so in these two appeals the appellants voluntarily applied for and accepted the licences knowing fully well that the Financial Commissioner had the power to frame rules governing the licences Whether the amendments made to the Rules after the appellants licences were renewed are applicable is another matter but the appellants cannot question the power of the Financial Commissioner to frame those rules Apprehending that it was fruitless to do business on these terms and fearing the resort by the <ORG> to coercive measures for the recovery of the amounts due to it the appellants filed writ petitions in <ORG> soon after the commencement of the term of their respective licences The challenge now is generally based on the ground that there is no quid pro quo between the fees imposed on the licensees and the services rendered to them that the fees are in the nature of a tax which there is no authority to impose that the levy is beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> or that the terms and conditions of the licence constitute an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the citizen to carry on business for the sale of liquor We will notice first the relevant provisions of the Act under consideration Section confers upon <ORG> the power to prohibit the import or export of any intoxicant into or from Punjab or any part thereof and to prohibit the transport of any intoxicant Section prohibits the sale of liquor except under the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a licence granted in that behalf Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to lease on such conditions and for such period as it may deem fit or retail any country liquor or intoxicating drug within any specified local area On such lease being granted the Collector under sub section has to grant to the lessee a licence in the form of his lease Section confers power on the authority granting any licence to cancel or suspend it if inter alia any duty or fee payable thereon has not been duly paid By section <ORG> may make rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act By clause of section <ORG> is authorised to make rules prescribing the scale of fees or the manner of fixing the fees payable in respect of any licence permit or pass or in respect of the storing of any intoxicant On March the second respondent the Excise and Taxation Commissioner issued a notification in the exercise of powers conferred by section of the Act whereby a new Rule was substituted for the old Rule On March another notification was issued by the second respondent introducing the Punjab Liquor Licence Second Amendment Rules Rule prescribes the procedure for the grant of licences by auction Rule provides for the payment of security deposit and Rule for the resale of licence on the cancellation of an existing licence The conditions of auction which we have set out at the beginning of our judgment are in fact in terms of the rules framed under section of the Act The Prohibition and Excise laws in force in other States contain provisions substantially similar to those contained in the Punjab Excise Act The power of <ORG> under section of the Act to prohibit absolutely the import export or transport of any intoxicant its power under section to prohibit the manufacture or collection of an intoxicant or the construction or working of a distillery or a brewery except under the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a licence granted in that behalf its power under section to prohibit the possession of any intoxicant and its power under section to lease on such conditions and for such period as it may deem fit the right of manufacturing supplying or selling an intoxicant are only in conformity with the ancient and hoary rights which all governments in all countries have exercised in matters concerning intoxicants it was contended that the citizen had an unfettered right to carry on trade and business in liquor under Article of the Constitution and therefore the provisions of the Ajmer Excise Regulation I of which conferred discretion on the Excise Commissioner to restrict the number of liquor shops and to licence them by auction to the highest bidder were void as creating a monopoly in liquor trade This position was not disputed but is was urged that the sale of intoxicating liquors by retail in small quantities should be without restriction because every person had a right which interred in him that is a natural right to carry on trade in intoxicating liquors and that the <ORG> had no right to create a monopoly in them This contention was repelled on the reasoning contained in the judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> vs Christensen <NAME> observed There is in this position an assumption of a fact which does not exist that when the liquors are taken in excess the But as it leads to neglect of business and waste of property and general democratisation it affects those who are immediately connected with and de pendent upon him By the general concurrence of opinion of every civilized and Christian community there are few sources of crime and misery to society equal to the drain shop where intoxicating liquors in small quantities to be drunk at the time The contention that the effect of some of the provisions of the Regulation was to enable Government to confer monopoly rights on One or more persons to the exclusion of others and that the creation of such monopoly rights could not be sustained under Article was repelled on the ground that Elimination and exclusion from business is inherent in the nature of liquor business and it will hardly be proper to apply to such a business principles applicable to trades which all could carry of that a perusal of the Act and the rules framed thereunder made it clear that no person has any absolute right to sell liquor and that the purpose of the Act and the rules is to control and restrict the consumption of intoxicating liquors such con trol and restriction being obviously necessary for the preservation of public health and morals and to raise revenue <NAME> speaking for a Constitution Bench observed that though at first sight it may appear to be far fetched to bring the subject of intoxicating liquor under Public Order yet it had to be noted that there was a tendency in Europe and America to regard alcoholism as a menace to public order The learned Judge then referred to the decision in <NAME> vs The Queen in which the Canada Temperance Act was held to be a law relating to the peace order and good Government of Canada the decisions in <NAME> case and <NAME> case were cited by a Constitution Bench as laying down the proposition that there was no inherent right in a citizen to sell liquor and that the control and restriction over the consumption of intoxicating liquors was necessary for the preservation of public health and morals and to raise revenue These unanimous decisions of five Constitution Benches uniform by emphasised after a careful consideration of the problem involved that the <ORG> has the power to prohibit trades which are injurious to the health and welfare of the public that elimination and exclusion from the business is inherent in the nature of liquor business that no person has an absolute right to deal in liquor and that all forms of dealings in liquor have from their inherent nature been treated as a class by themselves by all civilised communities The contention that the citizen had either a natural or a fundamental right to carry on trade or business in liquor thus stood rejected The appellant therein who was doing business in liquor in a hotel under an annual licence issued under the Jammu and Kashmir Excise Act challenged an order of <ORG> asking him to shift the licensed premises to some other approved locality Four contentions were raised in that case on behalf of the appellant the first of which was that if section of the Act of was construed as conferring an absolute discretion on <ORG> in the matter of granting licences to do business in liquor it was void on the ground that it infringed Article of the Constitution in liquor and this <ORG> desired to make the posi tion clear in order to avoid further confusion in the matter The decisions in <NAME> case <NAME> case and <NAME> case were cited before the <ORG> but it took the view that they did not support the contention that dealing in liquor was not business or trade or that a right to do business in liquor was not a fundamental right <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> expressed the conclusion thus We therefore bold that dealing in liquor is business and a citizen has a right to do business in the commodity but the <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the said right in public interests On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the State of Bombay that as prize competitions were opposed to public policy there could be no trade or business of promoting a prize competition and therefore the question of infraction of the respondents fundamental right under Article did not arise Speaking for <ORG> <NAME> after examining several Australian and American cases observed We have no doubt that there are certain activities which can under no circumstances be regarded as trade or business or commerce although the usual forms and instruments are employed therein This decision was also cited before the <ORG> in <NAME> case but it said This decision only lays down that gambling is not business or trade After referring to the decisions in <NAME> case and <NAME> case it was observed that one of the important purposes of selling the exclusive right to vend liquor was to raise revenue and since the <ORG> had the power to sell exclusive privileges there was no basis for contending that the owner of the privileges could not decline to accept the highest bid if he thought that the price offered was inadequate fundamental right to trade or carry on business in the properties or rights belonging to the <ORG> nor can there be any infringement of Art Civil Appeals Nos and of it was held on a review of various authorities including the decision in <NAME> case that the <ORG> had the exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor that it had the power to hold a public auction for granting the right or privilege to sell liquor that traditionally intoxicating liquors were the subject matter of <ORG> monopoly and that there was no fundamental right in a citizen to carry on trade or business in liquor One of us the learned Chief Justice observed while speaking on behalf of <ORG> that There are three principal reasons to hold that there is no fundamental right of citizens to carry on trade or to do business in liquor Second there is power of the <ORG> to enforce an absolute prohibition of manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor In our opinion the true position governing dealings in intoxicants is as stated and reflected in the <ORG> decisions of this <ORG> in <NAME> case <NAME> case <NAME> case <NAME> case <NAME> case and the case as interpreted in <NAME> case and <NAME> case There is no fundamental right to do trade or business in intoxicants The <ORG> under its regulatory powers has the right to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants its manufacture storage export import sale and possession This may explain why the <ORG> restricted its final conclusion to holding that dealing in liquor is business and the citizen has a right to do business in that commodity that the citizen has a fundamental right to do trade or business in liquor If we may repeat <NAME> said We therefore hold that dealing in liquor is business and a citizen has a right to do business in that commodity but the <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the said right in public interests The wider right to prohibit absolutely would include the narrower right to permit dealing in intoxicants on such terms of general application as the <ORG> deems expedient Citizens cannot have any fundamental right to trade or carry on business in the properties or rights belonging to the <ORG> nor can there be any infringement of Article if the <ORG> tries to get the best available price for its valuable Section of the Act read with section empowers the Financial Commissioner to direct that a licence permit or pars be granted under the Act on payment of such fees and subject to such restrictions and on such conditions as he may prescribe A fee is a charge for special services rendered to individuals by some government tat agency and such a charge has an element in it of a quid pro quo Excise duty is primarily a duty on the production or manufacture of goods produced or manufactured within the country liquor holding licences in Forms and need bear no quid pro quo to the services rendered to the licencees pages which is based on the decisions <NAME> vs Chicago <NAME> vs <ORG> and As the authority which levied the fee had the power to exact a tax the levy could be upheld as a tax even if it could not be justified as a fee in the constitutiotin sense of thatterm But the Licence fee or Fixed fee in the instant case does not have to conform to the requirement that it must bear a reasonable relationship with the services rendered to the licensees It was expressly conceded in that case on behalf of the State of Orissa that the charge for the grant of a privilege for the off vend of foreign liquor under the system of auctioning was a tax and not a fee Besides the question Is to whether the word fee was used in section in the technical sense was not canvassed in that case The argument is that this decision is based on the earlier decision of <ORG> in <NAME> State of Punjab No of decided on February that the decision in <NAME> case was confirmed in appeal by this Court A Nos and of decided on August that there is no material difference between the rules and the procedure adopted in the instant cases and those which were struck down in <NAME> As the amount payable by the licensees on the basis of the bids offered by them in auctions and on the basis of Fixed and Assessed Fees is neither a fee in the technical sense nor a tax but is in the nature of the price of a privilege there is no question of the Financial Commissioner lacking power to organize auctions so as to authorize the recovery of any amont which is not a fee properly so called The Financial Commissioner under section of the Act read with rule has the power to direct that licences may be granted on pay ment of such fees that is such consideration as he may by rules prescribe The amendments having come into force before April would govern the appellants licences and they are therefore liable to pay the fixed fees under the amended Rules The rules made under section authorise the imposition of additional fees and such authorization would operate on all licences to be effective thereafter
