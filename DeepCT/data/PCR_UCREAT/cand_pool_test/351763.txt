These are six applications made to this Court under the provisions of Section of the Civil Procedure Code and of Section read with Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure At the hearing <NAME> a Vakil enrolled and ordinarily practising in this Court was authorised by the plaintiffs opposite parties to appear and plead on their behalf and the question therefore arose whether in these matters he as a Vakil was entitled to be heard On this question we have heard on the one side the learned Advocate General on behalf of the <ORG> and also learned Counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> and of the Attorney on the record and on the other side the learned Government Pleader Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the Vakil <ORG> In this connection I may refer also to the case of <NAME> Having carefully considered all the arguments advanced on either side I am satisfied that the learned Advocate General contention cannot be supported But practice and I may perhaps add prejudice must give way to law and to the rights conferred by law I am sorry I am unable to agree with my learned colleague on the preliminary point argued in connection with these applications namely as to the right of audience claimed by the learned <NAME> for the opposite party whose contention is that the <NAME>s of this <ORG> have such right under Rule Chapter II Original Side read with Section of the Legal Practitioners Act namely to appear and plead in all cases except before a Judge of the High <ORG> <ORG> or High <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction in a Presidency town He contends that our Rule only restricts their right when the original side exercises its original jurisdiction Six applications were made to me when I was sitting on the original side on behalf of the defendants in the above mentioned <ORG> suits against an order passed by a learned Judge of <ORG> refusing sanction to prosecute the plaintiffs I held it was unnecessary to consider the question as it was practically conceded by learned Counsel for the plaintiffs opposite party that the <ORG> over which I then presided as the superior <ORG> of <ORG> had power to deal with the applications under Section Criminal Procedure Code Clearly <ORG> as such had no jurisdiction to remand the applications to any other Bench of this <ORG> than to the <ORG> on the original side It is also to be noticed that the original side is in no sense a <ORG> subordinate to <ORG> of the same <ORG> which hears appeals thereform and an application by way of appeal to it under Section Criminal Procedure Code does not appear to me to be competent <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Ind Reference to that case shows that the learned Judges do not use the expression jurisdiction and if I may say so with respect correctly use the words special power They held that the power conferred by Section Criminal Procedure Code was not a part of the Appellate and Revisional Jurisdiction of the <ORG> under Chapters XXXI and XXXII Criminal Procedure Code but that it was a special power It does not seem to me that a new power has been conferred upon us by Section nor has it created a special jurisdiction It strikes me that a question relating to the rival claims of different sections of legal practitioners of this <ORG> involving rules framed by <ORG> cannot be determined in this way He says There has been a well established practice for at least years that these applications under Section should be made on the original side of this <ORG> and it was considered settled that these applications should be made on the original side by Counsel <NAME> said the same thing in <NAME> <NAME> it is a remarkable fact that the jurisdiction of a Judge sitting on the original side to exercise revisional powers over the Presidency Small Cause <ORG> which is now challenged for the first time has been exercised ever since the establishment of <ORG> over years ago as its records abundantly show who held that the Bench taking the Presidency group had no jurisdiction in Calcutta and therefore no jurisdiction over the Calcutta Small Cause <ORG> However another application was made by a <NAME> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> to the Chief Justice Sir <NAME> and Mr Justice <NAME> The case of <NAME> In re related to an application made by a <NAME> of this <ORG> that he had a right to be heard in the Presidency Small Cause <ORG> where he had been refused audience is that <ORG> has no jurisdiction in the exercise of its revisional powers on the criminal side to interfere with orders relating to sanction under Section Criminal Procedure Code By these the High <ORG> was vested with civil and criminal jurisdiction both original and appellate By the Letters Patent of the th December the earlier Letters Patent of were revoked This High <ORG> was thus the successor of <ORG> with territorial jurisdiction confined to the Presidency Town of Calcutta and as <ORG> was not a <ORG> which had power of superintenence over the Mofussil <ORG> the original side did not and does not possess such power and similarly as the appellate side dealing with appeals from Provincial <ORG> has no jurisdiction over the <ORG> the power of superintendence over it which <ORG> had remained in the original side of the High <ORG> There are some large powers which still remain in the original side of the High <ORG> as the successor of the <ORG> which do not belong to the appellate side of the <ORG> although it is correct to say that they belong to the High <ORG> taking the two sides collectively It seems clear to me that all such powers when exercised by the original side are exercised in its original jurisdiction within the meaning of Section of the Legal Practitioners Act It has not been doubted that <ORG> in its original side has power to issue a writ of certiorari which is a writ to an inferior <ORG> to call up the records of a cause therein depending that conscionable justice may be therein administered It is an authority derived from the old Supreme <ORG> and is similar to that which was exercised by the <ORG> of Queen Bench in England and if the Commissioners in this case were exceeding their jurisdiction in making the assessment it seems clear that we have the power to quash it upon certiorari notwithstanding the provision in Section in the Calcutta Municipal Consolidation Act but as it appeared that the Commissioner had acted within their powers the appeal was dismissed The right of a single Judge sitting on the original side of this <ORG> to issue such a writ was not questioned in that case although eminent Counsel appeared and contested that matter It seems to me necessarily to follow that the ordinary incidents of the procedure of that <ORG> attach to such applications Clause of <ORG> Charter has no doubt been repealed by Section of the present <ORG> Small Cause <ORG>s Act XV of and the power of superintendence is now given by Section of that Act To my mind it makes no difference as the Appellate Divisional Benches of this <ORG> as such have no power of superintendence over <ORG> in the same way as the original <ORG> has no jurisdiction Section of that Act provides that these <ORG>s are subject to the general control and order of <ORG> which is defined in Section as the highest Civil <ORG> of Appeal which is practically the same definition as we find in the General Clauses Act of and Act IX of has taken the place of Act I of which also excludes the ordinary original Civil jurisdiction of this <ORG> Section gives revisional jurisdiction to <ORG> which is exercised by our <ORG> and Section gives administrative control and superintendence to <ORG> in the same way as Section of the <ORG> Small <ORG> Act gives it to <ORG> References from the former are heard by that Bench of our <ORG> which deals with appeals from the original side and those from the latter by the <ORG> Section of <ORG>s Act gives power to <ORG> to make its own rules for the exercise by one or more Judges or by Division <ORG>s constituted by two or more Judges of the <ORG> of the original and appellate jurisdictions vested in the <ORG> in such manner as may appear to the <ORG> to be convenient for the due administration of justice It seems to me unnecessary to disturb the established practice of this <ORG> for such applications Although I have stated some of the grounds for my decision in the view that our respective judgments in a matter of this nature are not likely to have any binding effect I refrain from elaborating them In this case there is no question of any fundamental principles of justice being in danger and it seems to me that no case has been made out for making a departure for introducing a novelty for the sake of novelty In these six matters it appears that two plaintiffs <NAME> and <NAME> brought respectively suits and suits against different defendants in <ORG> Thereafter on the st December in each case application was made on behalf of the defendant for a sanction to prosecute the plaintiff under Section of the Indian Penal Code in respect of the claim and under Section in respect of the statement made in the application for leave to sue When the application came on for hearing a question arose whether <NAME> through whom the plaintiffs opposite parties desired to be heard was entitled as a Vakil to appear and plead on behalf of his clients Having considered this affidavit having regard also to the decision in all six suits and to the fact that even now though the plaintiff says he has independent evidence there is no affidavit in support of his own we think that it is unnecessary to take further evidence at this stage and that a case for the grant of sanction has been made out In each case we therefore set aside the order of <ORG> and grant to the
