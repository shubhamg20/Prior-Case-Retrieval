Firstly the applicant has prayed for modification of the order dated October made in Company Petition No of to the extent this court directed the official liquidator to forthwith take charge of all the properties and effects of the first respondent <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the company and to exempt from the direction given in the said order in so far as it relates to the assets taken over by the <ORG> pursuant to the mahazar dated December prepared by the <ORG> and their sale in favour of the second respondent and secondly to permit the <ORG> to hand over the assets of the company to the second respondent pursuant to the sale of the assets of the company made in favour of the second respondent The facts which are relevant for the disposal of this application may be briefly stated as hereunder a <ORG> instituted proceedings in Company Petition No of under Section and read with Section of the Companies Act hereinafter referred to as the Act for winding up of the company on January and on the said company petition this court directed notice on February and thereafter the company came to be wound up by this court by its order dated March as on September to the <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred on it under Section of the State Financial <ORG>s Act hereinafter referred to as the Financial <ORG>s Act took possession of the assets of the company on December In the same order the <ORG> had authorised the <ORG> to take steps for the sale of the assets of the company in its possession subject to the terms and conditions imposed in the said order This court by its order dated April recalled the order dated March winding up the company on the ground that the appeal filed by the company against the order annexure was pending consideration before <ORG> on the date of the winding up order made by this court on March The said application was allowed by this court by its order dated September Further during the pendency of this application by means of order dated August this court had directed the applicant in Company Application No of i the third respondent in this application to furnish the valuation report of the company in respect of the assets sold by the company on the date of the sale either from an approved valuer or a <ORG> valuer Elaborating this submission they firstly submitted that the law is firmly established that the secured creditor can stand outside the winding up proceedings and realise his security without the intervention of the court by effecting the sale of the mortgaged property by private or public sale and leave of the court is necessary only when intervention of the court is sought for realising the security and in this case the sale of the assets of the company having been made in exercise of the statutory power conferred on the <ORG> under Sub section of Section of the Act the sale effected is perfectly valid in law and the properties in question do not vest with the official liquidator on winding up of the company It is their contention that since on the date of the winding up order passed by this court on October in Company Petition No of the assets of the company having been sold pursuant to the proceedings initiated under the provisions of the SIC Act and the sale of the assets of the company having been approved by the <ORG> and having become final it is not permissible for the official liquidator to take possession of the said assets which have already been sold to the second respondent Secondly they submitted that the SIC Act is a special enactment and the provisions contained in the said enactment will prevail over the provisions contained in the Act In this connection they drew my attention to Sub section of Section of the Act which confers power on the <ORG> to get the assets of a sick industrial company sold in such manner as it may deem fit and forward the sale proceeds to this court for orders for distribution in accordance with the provisions of Section A and other provisions of the Act and also Section of the SIC Act which provides that the provisions of the SIC Act and of any Rules or Scheme made thereunder shall have overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law except the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act or the memorandum or articles of association of an industrial company or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the SIC Act etc Therefore relying upon the said provisions they submitted that since the assets of the company were sold after giving wide publicity and the offer made by the second respondent which was the highest offer having been accepted by the <ORG> and the same also having been approved by the <ORG> there is absolutely no justification to nullify the sale or prevent the <ORG> from handing over the assets of the company to the second respondent as per the terms and conditions of the sale Thirdly they submitted that since the sale of the assets of the company has been made prior to the order of winding up made on October which has been approved by the <ORG> the provisions contained in the Act which requires the leave of the court for the sale of the assets of the company which is under winding up cannot be made applicable Further relying upon the orders made by this court in the writ petitions filed by the company and its directors and also the suit crores and lakhs and if at this stage this court takes the view that the sale of the assets of the company effected is not valid it would result in irreparable injury to the second respondent He further pointed out that even on this date the third respondent has not been able to get an offer from any person for a price much more than the one at which the assets of the company are sold to the second respondent Repelling the contentions advanced by <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> learned counsel for the official liquidator and <NAME> learned counsel for the third respondent submitted that the proviso given to Section of the Act makes the security of every secured creditor subject to a pari passu charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen portion therein and where a secured creditor instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debt seeks to realise the security the liquidator is entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such charge and any amount realised by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge shall be applied rateably for the discharge of workmen dues and so much of the debt due to such secured creditor as could not be realised by him shall rank pari passu with the workmen dues and therefore whenever there is a pari passu charge over any property of a company in winding up by virtue of the proviso to Section of the Act leave of the company court is necessary for the sale of the property as the charge holder is the official liquidator Comp Cas Kar and in the light of the direction given by <ORG> in the said case has clearly held that <ORG> in <NAME> case Comp Cas did not have an occasion to consider the impact of Sections and A of the Act or Section of the Act and the rest of the decisions were based merely on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case Comp Cas and therefore the sale of the assets of the company made during the winding up proceedings is void in law and is not binding on the official liquidator and the applicant is not entitled for the relief sought in this application They also pointed out that there is no conflict between the provisions contained in the Act and also the SIC Act in so far as the procedure required to be adopted in the matter of sale of assets of the company in winding up In the background of divergent contentions advanced by learned counsel appearing for the parties the question that would arise for consideration is as to whether the sale of the assets of the company effected by the applicant Corporation is void in law on the ground that the leave of the company court for the sale of the said assets has not been obtained It is profitable to first refer to the relevant provisions of the Act the SIC Act and also the SFC Act before proceeding to discuss the contentions raised by learned counsel appearing for the parties The court which is winding up the company shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force have jurisdiction to entertain or dispose of a any suit or proceeding by or against the company any claim made by or against the company including claims by or against any of its branches in India any application made under Section by or in respect of the company any question of priorities or any other question whatsoever whether of law or fact which may relate to or arise in course of the winding up of the company whether such suit or proceeding has been instituted or is instituted or such claim or question has arisen or arises or such application has been made or is made before or after the order for the winding up of the company or before or after the commencement of the Companies Amendment Act Any suit or proceeding by or against the company which is pending in any court other than that in which the winding up of the company is proceeding may notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be transferred to and disposed of by that court I Where the Board after making inquiry under Section and after consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances and after giving an opportunity of being heard to all concerned parties is of opinion that the sick industrial company is not likely to make its net worth exceed the accumulated losses within a reasonable time while meeting all its financial obligations and that the company as a result thereof is not likely to become viable in future and that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up it may record and forward its opinion to the concerned <ORG> The <ORG> shall on the basis of the opinion of the Board order winding up of the sick industrial company and may proceed and cause to proceed with the winding up of the sick industrial company in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub section or subsection the Board may cause to be sold the assets of the sick industrial company in such manner as it may deem fit and forward the sale proceeds to <ORG> for orders for distribution in accordance with the provisions of Section A and other provisions of the Companies Act Effect of the Act on other laws The provisions of this Act and of any rules or schemes made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law except the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act for the time being in force or in the memorandum or articles of association of an industrial company or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act Where there has been under any scheme under this Act an amalgamation of a sick industrial company with another company the provisions of Section A of the Income tax Act shall subject to the modifications that the power of <ORG> under that Section may be exercised by the Board without any recommendation by the specified authority referred to in that section apply in relation to such amalgamation as they apply in relation to the amalgamation of a company owning an industrial undertaking with another company Now let me examine the question that would fall for my consideration in this application No doubt the decision of this court in the case of <ORG> Comp Cas and the decision of <ORG> in the case of Gujarat State Financial Corporation Comp Cas rendered following the decision of this court in the case of <ORG> Comp Cas relied upon by learned counsel for the applicant and the second respondent support their contention that the secured creditor is entitled to stand outside the winding up proceedings and enforce his security and in that view of the mutter even after the amendment of Sections A of the Act leave of the company court is not required to be obtained by the secured creditor to enforce his security and bring the assets mortgaged to sale to realise his security It is further pointed out in the case of Gujarat State Financial Corporation Comp Cas that by the amendment to the proviso to Section of the Act and insertion of the Explanation thereto in the only change which has been made is that the secured creditor too is liable to pay only the proportionate expenses of the preservation taking into consideration the pari passu charge in favour of the workmen dues but the option is still left to the secured creditor to realise the security without proving his debt in the winding up proceedings and where the secured creditor opts to realise his security without relinquishing his security and without proving his debt the realisation is to be governed by the proviso to Section and the workmen get from such realisation only that much proportion for which they rank pari passu qua the realisation of the security The court further pointed out that even after the Companies Amendment Act the principle enunciated in <NAME> case Comp Cas still applies to the secured creditor who instead of relinquishing his security and providing his debts opts to realise the security without intervention of the court Though the decisions referred to above as pointed out by me support the case of the applicant and the second respondent in the light of the <ORG> decision of this court in the case of Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Comp Cas which has considered the earlier decision of this court in the case of <ORG> Comp Cas and also the decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> Comp Cas and has taken the view fairly in identical circumstances that the sale of the assets of the company which was the subject matter of dispute in the said case without the leave of the court was not valid and directed for resale of the assets of the company subject to the conditions imposed in the said order I am unable to accede to the submissions made by <NAME> and <NAME> In other words the extent of his claim which a secured creditor could not realise out of his security because of the rights created in favour of the workmen because of their pari passu charge on the security would get an overriding preference for payment in winding up along with workmen dues In both these capacities he has an interest in the sale of the mortgage security by the secured creditor What are the rights of a pari passu charge holder Can a mortgagee exercise his power of sale without the consent of a pari passu charge holder The court said that no suit can therefore be filed to enforce a mortgage which entails the disintegration of either the amount or the security It is therefore necessary that when a sale of a mortgaged property takes place both the charge holders should join in the sale Hence when a sale takes place it is for the simultaneous recovery of claims of all pari passu charge holders It was further observed in paragraph thus page Also the statutory right which is given to financial corporations under Section to sell the property has to be exercised consistently with the rights of a pari passu charge holder in those favour a statutory charge is created by the proviso to Section of the Companies Act when the company is in liquidation Therefore such a power can be exercised only with the concurrence of the official liquidator and the official liquidator is required to take the permission of the court before giving such concurrence since he is an officer of the court and is required to act under the directions of the court while exercising his powers on behalf of the workers Section of the State Financial Corporations Act merely confers certain powers on the mortgagee It does not cover a situation where there is a pari passu charge holder Therefore the power to sell which is given to a financial corporation under Section has to be exercised consistently with the right of a pari passu charge holder Nevertheless by the time the appellant completed the sale transaction in favour of respondent No on September the winding up order had already been passed on September and the official liquidator had already come into the picture as liquidator of the company under Section of the Act There were workmen dues to the tune of Rs Similarly though the official liquidator by virtue of Section of the Act has the power to sell the property of the company in winding up and as a pari passu charge holder under Section of the Act he has the power to sell the said property with the sanction of the court to realise the charge he cannot sell the property all by himself ignoring the secured creditors like the <ORG> The aspect of repugnancy between the provisions of two Acts i the SFC Act and the Companies Act and in that situation the provisions of the SFC Act having overriding effect over the provisions of the Act by virtue of Section of the SFC Act is not to be seriously considered because there is no inconsistency between the provisions of the said two Acts Section of the SFC Act merely confers certain powers on the secured creditor It does not deal with a situation where there is a pari passu charge holder The power to sell which has been given to the <ORG> under Section of the SFC Act has to be exercised consistently with the right of the pari passu charge holder who in the case of a company under liquidation would be the official liquidator whose consent can be subject to sanction of the court Therefore the statutory right given to the appellant <ORG> under Section of the SFC Act being required to be exercised consistently with the right of the pari passu charge holder in whose favour a statutory charge is created by the proviso to Sub section of Section of the Act when the company is in liquidation and the said pari passu charge holder being the official liquidator who is required to act under the directions of the court leave of the court would be necessary and any sale without such leave would be void under Section of the Act But the said decision had no provision corresponding to Sections and A of the Act I am in respectful agreement with the views expressed by this court in the case of Karnataka State At this stage it is necessary to consider the contention of Sri <NAME> and <NAME> that since the sale has been effected in view of the provisions contained in Sub section of Section of the SIC Act the decision of this court in the case of Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Comp Cas which was rendered only considering the provisions of the SFC Act has no bearing as the provisions of the SFC Act have overriding effect over the provisions of the Act which is a general law Under these circumstances the question that would arise for consideration is as to whether there is any conflict between the provisions contained in SIC Act which is a special enactment and the provisions of the Act and in that event the provisions of the SIC Act would prevail over the provisions of the Act as contended by Sri <NAME> and <NAME> I am of the view that there is no merit in the above submission of learned counsel Sub section of Section of the SIC Act provides for enquiry being conducted by the <ORG> and it confers power on the <ORG> to recommend to <ORG> for winding up of the company under certain circumstances set out in the said provision No doubt Sub section of Section of the SIC Act confers power on the <ORG> to get the assets of the sick industrial company to be sold in such manner as it deems fit notwithstanding anything contained in Sub section or Sub section of Section of the Act in such manner as it may deem fit and forward the sale proceeds to <ORG> for orders for distribution in accordance with Section A and other provisions of the Act However Section of the SIC Act on which strong reliance has been placed provides that the provisions of the SIC Act and of any rules or schemes made under the SIC Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law except the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act for the time being in force or in the memorandum or articles of association of an industrial company or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the SIC Act Therefore the question that is required to be considered is whether there is any conflict between the provisions contained in Sub section of Section of the Act which gives power to the <ORG> to get the assets of the sick industrial unit sold and the provisions contained in the Act in the matter of the sale of the assets of a company in respect of which proceedings for winding up have been commenced It is well settled that if the provisions contained in the two enactments can be read harmoniously and if such harmonious construction would subserve the purpose or objects contained in both the enactments the court should proceed to harmoniously construct and interpret the provisions contained in both the enactments While the secured creditor has a right to stand outside the winding up proceedings and get his security enforced and when the proceedings are pending before the <ORG> the <ORG> also has undoubted rights in view of Sub section of Section of the SIC Act notwithstanding what is provided in Sub section of Section of the SIC Act to get the assets of such company sold the question is whether it is not necessary in view of the pendency of the proceedings before the company court to secure leave of the court for such a sale The power to grant permission for sale of the assets of the court in respect of a company in respect of which winding up proceedings have commenced is given to the court Under these circumstances there cannot be any doubt that the court will take into consideration not only the interest of the secured creditor who is entitled to enforce his security by standing outside the winding up proceedings but also the interest of the workmen who are also given substantial rights for which a charge is created on the security of the secured creditor and also various other creditors of the company If a sale is to be caused by the <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred under Sub section of Section of the SIC Act the <ORG> may be primarily guided by the interest of the secured creditor only Under these circumstances while I am of the view that in view of Sub section of Section of the Act the <ORG> has the undoubted right to get the assets of a sick industrial unit sold either during pendency of the proceedings before it or notwithstanding the power conferred on the court to appoint a liquidator etc As stated by me earlier while power is given to the <ORG> to get the assets of the company caused to be sold by it what is required is that leave of the court has to be secured for such sale if winding up of the company has already commenced If such a construction is placed to the provisions contained in the Act and the SIC Act it would protect the interest of everybody who is interested in the affairs of the company and who has a claim against the company The winding up court does these acts through a liquidator who has been given wide powers by Section of the Act Therefore in the light of the above discussion am of the view that there is no conflict between the provisions contained in Sub section of Section of the SIC Act and the provisions contained in the Act Section of the State Financial Corporations Act merely confers certain powers on the mortgagee It does not cover a situation where there is a pan passu charge holder Therefore the power to sell which is given to a financial corporation under Section has to be exercised consistently with the right of a pan passu charge holder Therefore a combined reading of Sub section of Section and Clause of Sub section of Section of the Act makes it clear that even in cases where winding up petitions have been presented if the sale of the assets of the company is made such sale would be void even though there is no order of winding up In so far as the contention advanced on behalf of the applicant and the second respondent that every effort was made by the company and its director to get the sale of the assets of the company nullified by repeatedly filing writ petitions before this court and this court having rejected the writ petitions it must be held that the sale of the assets of the company has been properly done and therefore the applicant is entitled to deliver the assets of the company to the second respondent pursuant to the sale held is concerned it is no doubt true that every effort was made by the company and its director to nullify the sale by repeatedly approaching this court as referred to by me earlier Since I have taken the view that the sale held was invalid merely because the company and its director have made every effort to nullify the sale by repeatedly invoking the jurisdiction of this court under Articles and of the Constitution of India cannot be a ground to approve the sale which is invalid in law But when the validity of the sale is examined in the light of the provisions contained in the Act in my view the principle laid down by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> referred to by <NAME> that in a distress sale a fair market price is not secured and therefore the sale cannot be set aside cannot be applied The said decision was rendered while considering whether there was any material irregularity or illegality in the sale conducted It is also necessary to place on record the submission made by Sri <NAME> on behalf of the third respondent <NAME> that he will bear the expenses for conducting fresh sale to be incurred by the official liquidator and the <ORG>
