After hearing learned counsel for the appellant we felt that it is not necessary to send notice to the respondents to contest the appeal as there is no scope for absolving <ORG> from liability In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter a policy of insurance may be a policy which a is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer or by a co operative society allowed under section to transact the business of an insurer and insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub section i against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place ii against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place Provided that a policy shall not be required i to cover liability in respect of the death arising out of and in the course of his employment of the employees of a person insured by the policy or in respect of bodily injury sustained by such an Section provides that a policy of insurance must be a policy which insures the persons against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of death or bodily injury bo any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place the same time learned Judges pointed out that the old Act is now repealed by the new <ORG> and Section of the new Act correspondinq to Section of the old Act has been siubstantially altered and hence the above interpretation of Section of the old Act will govern the cases which have arisen under the old Act Under Section of the new Act the policy must be a policy which insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub section i against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place ii against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place Sub section provides that a policy of insurance shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any accident up to the following limits namely i Hence under sub section there is no upper limitation for the insurer regarding the amount of compensation awarded in respect of death or bodily injury of a victim ot the accident It is therefore apparent that the limit contained in the old Act has been removed and the policy should insure the liability incurred and cover injury to any person including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle Hence the decisions rendered under the old Act vis a vis gratuitous passengers are of no avail while considering the liability of the insurance company in respect of any accident which occurred or would occur after the new Act came into force We therefore dismiss these appeals
