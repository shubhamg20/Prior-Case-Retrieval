HEADNOTE The appellant an officer of <ORG> challenged the provisional integrated gradation list of Forest Officers of the former Andhra and Hyderabad States published under the provisions of the States Reorganisation Act in his writ petition contending that a the inter se seniority between the appellant and the th respondent both of whom originally belonged to <ORG> had been wrongly fixed by showing the th respondent as senior to the appellant whereas the appellant was legally entitled to seniority over the th respondent and that respondent nos and officers allotted to the State of Andhra Pradesh from the Telengana region of the former Hyderabad State had been erroneously assigned ranks above the appellant in violation of the principles laid down by <ORG> for equation of posts and fixation of inter se seniority When the writ petition came up for hearing the appellant pressed only his claim for seniority over the th respondent and as the contention was well founded the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and issued a writ of mandamus directing <ORG> to modify the gradation list by showing the appellant as senior to the th respondent In the appeal to <ORG> by the th respondent <ORG> took the view that since the prayer contained in the writ the petition was for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing respondents nos and to forbear from implementing the provisional gradation list published alongwith the Government Order dated January and as the appellant had not pressed the prayer for quashing of the list in so far as it related to the officers of Telengana region viz The <ORG> can take note of changed circumstances and suitably mould the relief to be granted to the party concerned in order to mete out justice As far as possible the anxiety and endeavour of the <ORG> should be to remedy an in justice when it is brought to its notice rather than deny relief to an aggrieved party on purely technical and narrow procedural grounds It was under those circumstances that the appellant submitted before the single Judge at the time of final hearing of the writ petition that he was pressing the writ petition only in so far as it related to his claim for seniority over the th respondent The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal preferred by special leave is against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> setting aside the decision of a learned single judge of that Court and dismissing a writ petition filed by the present appellant The contentions raised by the petitioner in the writ petition were mainly two fold By the time the writ petition came up for hearing before the learned single judge <ORG> had already set right the appellant grievance concerning his ranking and the seniority in relation to respondents and Accordingly the learned single judge found that the contention put forward by the appellant that he was entitled to seniority over the th respondent was well founded The Division Bench took the view that since the prayer contained in the writ petition was for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing respondents No and to forbear from implementing the provisional gradation list published along with the <ORG> order dated January and inasmuch as the petitioner had not pressed the said prayer for quashing of the list in so for as it related to the officers of Telengana region respondents and the writ petition should have been dismissed on that short ground and the question relating to inter se seniority between the petitioner and the th respondent ought not to have been decided by the learned single judge In this view <ORG> allowed the writ appeal set aside the order passed by the learned single judge and dismissed the writ petition It was under those circumstances that the appellant submitted before the learned single judge of <ORG> at the time of final hearing of the writ petition that he was pressing the writ petition only in so far as it related to his claim for seniority over the th respondent We fail to see how the fact that the appellant had sought in the writ petition the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing respondents and to forbear from implementing or acting upon the provisional gradation list will operate to preclude him from seeking a lesser relief namely the quashing of the list only so far as it pertains to the fixation of the inter se seniority between himself and the th respondent Besides ignoring this crucial aspect <ORG> of <ORG> has also lost sight of the well established principle that in an action where a party has prayed for a larger relief it is always open to the court to grant him any smaller relief that he may be found to be entitled in law and thereby render substantial justice The <ORG> can undoubtedly take note of changed circumstances and suitably mould the relief to be granted to the party concerned in order to mete out justice in the case As far as possible the anxiety and endeavour of the <ORG> should be to remedy an injustice when it is brought to its notice rather than deny relief to an aggrieved party on purely technical and narrow procedural grounds Accordingly we set aside the judgment of <ORG> and remand the writ appeal to <ORG> for fresh disposal in accordance with law The parties will bear their respective costs in this appeal
