Collector of <ORG> issued a notice to the respondents calling upon them to show cause why a penalty under of the Sea <ORG> Act should not be imposed on the basis that the respondents under valued the goods deliberately that they gave in the prescribed form false particulars supported by false evidence that there was a failure to repatriate large amounts of foreign exchange contrary to the requirements of and that of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and Rules required a declaration of the actual amount representing the full export value and a mere declaration of any value would not be sufficient compliance with the provisions that under the circumstances by virtue of A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act the exportation constituted an offence filed a writ petition contending that the declaration to the Collector of <ORG> was sufficient compliance with the statutory provisions and that the Collector having passed the consignments for shipment had no further jurisdiction to take proceedings against them A single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the petitions but on appeal <ORG> allowed the petitions Neither nor any other provision of the Act empowers the rule making authority to add to the restrictions imposed by the section and for finding out the restrictions imposed by the section one can only look at that section So far as goods sold to the foreign buyer are concerned it is possible for the exporter to know the exact export value but that would not be the position when the goods are sent on consignment basis and in such a case the exporter can give only an estimated value Therefore the declarations given in the present case do satisfy the requirements of though they did not correctly furnish all the information asked for in the form and hence there was no contravention of the section No subject can insist on an interpretation which will have the effect of sabotaging the national economy A As itself does not impose any restrictions and contemplates rules being made on a evidence which is to support declaration authority to which the declaration is to be furnished and the manner of payment the restrictions imposed by rules which are deferrable to the section must be treated as restrictions imposed by the section When such a power is conferred on an exporter by a statute good faith on his part must be implied and is a condition prerequisite Section provides that the declare shall not give any information which he knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be false or not true Clerical mistakes and mistakes made bona fide even in respect of material particulars would not come within the mischief of the section There is no distinction between an exporter and the persons concerned in the export when no declaration under is given at all and in a case where the exporter gives a deliberately false declaration for the purpose of the applicability of of the Sea <ORG> Act It may be that action can be taken against an exporter under other sections of the Foreign Exchange ReguLation Act or the Sea <ORG> Act but that does not prevent action under A read with with the aid of customs authorities both against exporters and persons concerned in the prohibited export The Judgment of <NAME> and <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> These five appeals by certificate are directed against the judgment of <ORG> whereby <ORG> accepted the Writ Appeals against the judgment of <NAME> in Writ Petitions Nos and of and of and directed the issue of writs of prohi bition to <ORG> the Collector of <ORG> Madras and the Deputy Collector of <ORG> Visakhapatnam appellants before us prohibiting them from taking any action in pursuance of certain show cause notices issued by the Deputy Collector <ORG> Visakhapatnam Common questions of law are involved in these appeals and it would suffice if I give facts in Writ Petition No of out of which Civil Appeal No of arises dated August issued thereunder and A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act which exportation constituted an offence liable to be punished under of the Sea <ORG> Act In Writ Petition No of it was alleged that show cause notices had been issued to the petitioners on various dates and it was prayed that a writ of prohibition or other appropriate writ order or direction under Art to wit the Collector of <ORG> and the Collector of <ORG> having passed the consignments for shipment had no further right or jurisdiction to take proceedings relating to the consignments in question It was contended that if a declaration is found to be false it did not mean that there was a breach of the provisions of I may mention that before the Division Bench the case of the <ORG> was clarified in an affidavit and we may set out para thereof Since the Court has now directed the respondents to file a supplemental affidavit clarifying the stand taken by the department state respectfully that the stand taken by the department both in the show cause memo and here is that the essence of the offence committed by the appellants is that in the declaration required under section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act they have deliberately given false particulars supported by false evidence cure the sale thereof such directions as appear to it to be expedient for the purpose of securing the sale of the goods and payment therefor as aforesaid and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision may direct that the goods shall be assigned to <ORG> or to a person specified in the directions For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section and any order or directions made thereunder <ORG> may require any person making any export of goods to which a notification under sub section applies to exhibit contracts with his foreign buyer or other evidence to show that the full amount payable by the said buyer in respect of the goods has been or will within the prescribed period be paid in the prescribed manner No person shall when complying with any order or direction under section or with any requirement under section or when making any application or declaration to any authority or person for any purpose under this Act give any information or make any statement which he knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be false or not true in any material particulars If any person contravenes the provisions of section section section or sub section of section or of any rule direction or order made thereunder he shall a be liable to such penalty not exceeding three times the value of the foreign exchange in respect of which the contravention has taken place or five thousand rupees whichever is more as may be adjudged by the Director of Enforcement in the manner hereinafter provided or upon conviction by a <ORG>

contravention direct that any currency security gold or silver or goods or any other money or property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated to the Central Government and further direct that the foreign exchange holdings if any or the person committing the contravention or any part thereof shall be brought back into India or shall be retained outside India in accordance with the directions made in this behalf For the purposes of this sub section property in respect of which contravention has taken place shall include deposits in the bank where the said property is converted into such deposits Notwithstanding anything contained in section of the Code of Criminal Procedure it shall be lawful for any Magistrate of the first class specially empowered in this behalf by the State Government and for any Presidency Magistrate to pass a sentence of fine exceeding two thousand rupees on any person convicted of an offence punishable under this section No Court shall take cognizance a of any offence punishable under sub section except upon complaint in writing made by the Director of Enforcement or of any offence punishable under sub section A of this section or under section of the Indian Income tax Act as applied by section of this Act except upon complaint in writing made by the Director of Enforcement or any officer authorised in this behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> by a general or special order Provided that where any such offence is the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule direction or order made thereunder which prohibits the doing of an act without permission no such complaint shall be made unless the person accused of the offence has been given an opportunity of showing that he had such permission Without prejudice to any provisions of section or to any other provision contained in this Act the restrictions imposed by sub sections and of section sub section of section and clause a of sub section of section shall be deemed to have been imposed under section of the Sea Customs Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly except that section thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word may were substituted The offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively Sections of this Act Offences to which Penalties offence has reference The points which have emerged from the discussion at the <ORG> and which require determination may be formulated thus What is the meaning of the expression restrictions mean posed by sub section of section occurring in A of the Exchange Act Can other sections of the Exchange Act be looked at for determining the ambit of the restrictions imposed by Do restrictions imposed under the Rules made under the Exchange Act and relating to come within the meaning of this expression What is the true meaning of the words a declaration supported by such evidence as may be prescribed It is not necessary to pronounce on this proposition for I have come to the conclusion that there is one true construction of He was dealing with a case where a single section of an Act of Parliament has been introduced into another Act He said in <NAME> <NAME> When a single section of an Act of Parliament is introduced into another Act I think it must be read in the sense which it bore in the original Act from which it is taken and that consequently it is perfectly legitimate to refer to all the rest of that Act in order to ascertain what the section meant though those other sections are not incorporated in I do not mean that if there was in the original Act a section not incorporated which came by the way of a proviso or exception on that which It seems to me that this is the correct way of looking at A of the Exchange Act for another reason In other words the same contravention may attract penalties under the Sea Customs Act as well as the Exchange Act and it would be incongruous to hold that the restrictions imposed by a section are different for different Acts Then am I entitled to take into account the restrictions imposed by the Rules made under of the Exchange Act It seems to me that rules not deferrable to cannot be taken into account but any restrictions imposed by rules referrable to must be treated as restrictions imposed by I should certainly have been prepared to hold apart from authority that where a statute enables an authority to make regulations a regulation made under the Act becomes for the purpose of obedience or disobedience a provision of the Act These observations were approved by <ORG> in <NAME> Director of Public Prosecution thus There is of course no doubt that when a statute like the Emergency Powers Defence Act enables an authority to make regulations a regulation which is validly made under the Act i which is intra vires the regulation making authority should be regarded as though it were itself an enactment As <ORG> has pointed out in its judgment that was decided by <ORG> in <NAME> Norris and it appears to me that decision is perfectly correct <ORG> had stated in Wicks as follows The first observation which the court would make is that they are in complete agreement with the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Norris that where a statute enables an authority to make regulations a regulation made under the Act becomes for the purpose of obedience or disobedience a provision of the Act with the interpretation of of the Forward Contract Regulation Act which used the words such duties as may be assigned by or under this Act <NAME> speaking for the majority observed Learned Counsel is undoubtedly right in his submission that a power conferred by a bye law is not one conferred by the Act for in the context the expression conferred by the Act would mean conferred expressly or by necessary implication by the Act itself The words under the Act would in that context signify what is not directly to be found in the statute itself but is conferred or imposed by virtue of powers enabling this to be done in other words by laws made by a subordinate law making authority which is empowered to do so by the parent Act This distinction is thus between what is directly done by the enactment and what is done indirectly by rule making authorities which are vested with powers in that behalf by the Act at relied upon by the appellants are these I would therefore construe the words by or under this Act or as may be prescribed as follows by this Act applies to powers assigned proprio vigore by the provisions of the Act under this Act applies to an assignment made in exercise of an express power conferred under the provisions of the Act and may be prescribed takes in an assignment made in exercise of All a power conferred under a rule This construction gives a natural meaning to the plain words used in the section and avoids stretching the language of a statutory provision to save an illegal bye law The <NAME> case involved a statute which levied a tax on oleomargarine and regulated in detail oleomargarine manufacturers Section gave the Secretary the power to I would in this connection prefer to apply the English decisions referred to above as itself does not impose any restrictions and contemplates certain things to be prescribed Coming now to the construction of it seems to me that what it requires is a declaration of some actual figure which according to the declarant represents the full export value Otherwise there is no point in requiring support of such evidence as may be prescribed Further it is clear that some actual figure has to be mentioned when the exporter declares that he has received the amount representing the full export value How could it be that if itself requires absolutely correct particulars limits the requirement It seems to me that there is force in this contention but only to a limited extent The section confers a power on an exporter to lift the bar by a unilateral declaration When such a power is conferred on an exporter by a statute good faith on his part must at least be implied and be a condition prerequisite This construction is necessary in order to prevent abuse of the power given by the Act He can be sentenced to imprisonment which may extend to two years These persons are taken care of only under the Customs Act If they are covered by there is no reason to exclude the exporter himself it seems to me that no case for the issue of a writ of prohibition has been made out In the result the judgment of <ORG> is reversed and that of the learned Single Judge restored The appellants will have costs incurred in this Court <NAME> We had the advantage of studying the judgment just now delivered by our brother <NAME> After carefully analysing the arguments advanced before us we have come to the conclusion that no grounds were made out to interfere with the order of the Appellate Bench of <ORG> It is said that they had exported large quantities of manganese ore after ostensibly complying with the formalities of law but in reality they had under invoiced the various consignments sent by them and further that they had failed to repatriate foreign exchange of the value of about three chores of rupees obtained by them as the price of the manganese ore exported On the basis of the said information the Deputy Collector of <ORG> Visakhapatnam issued several notices to the respondents requiring them to show cause why no action should not be taken against them under the aforementioned provisions It is as against that decision these appeals have been brought after obtaining the necessary certificates from <ORG> The only question that arises for decision in these appeals is whether on the facts set out in the show cause notices which facts have to be assumed to be correct for the purpose of these proceedings the respondents can be held to have contravened which reads <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette prohibit the taking or sending out by land Section of the Act provides that no person when making an application or declaration to any authority or person for any purpose under the Act shall give any information or make any statement which he knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be false or not true in any material particular Section prescribes that if any person contravenes the provisions of or of any rule direction or order made thereunder he shall a be liable to such penalty not exceeding three times the value of the foreign exchange in respect of which the contravention has taken place or five thousand rupees whichever is more as may be adjudged by the Director of Enforcement in the manner provided in the Act or upon conviction by a court be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both In view of these provisions it was not disputed before us that if the information given by the respondents in the aforementioned declarations was false to the knowledge of those who made those declarations or if they had reasonable cause to believe that it was false or not true in any material particular then they are liable to be dealt with under Sub section of provides that where any export of goods has been made to which a notification under sub applies no person entitled to sell or procure the sale of the said goods shall except with the permission of the Reserve Bank do or refrain from doing anything or take or refrain from taking any action which has the effect of securing that payment for the goods is made otherwise than in the prescribed manner or does not represent the full amount payable by the foreign buyer in respect of the goods subject to such deductions if any as may be allowed by <ORG> or is delayed to such extent as aforesaid The contravention of the above provisions is punishable under This position is conceded by the Counsel appearing for the appellants But it is urged on behalf of the appellants that for the offences committed by the respondents they are not only liable to be punished under but also under A Section A as it stood at the relevant time provided that without prejudice to the provisions of or any other provision contained in this Act the restrictions imposed by sub of shall be deemed to have been imposed Under of the Sea Customs Act and all provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly except that thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word may were substituted That section to the extent material for our present purpose reads The offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively Offences Sections of Penalties this Act to which offen ce has refe rence The mere fact that the offences alleged against the respondents are punishable under would not exclude the application of A Therefore all that we have to see is whether those offences fall within the ambit of A Therefore prima facie there was no contravention of This is as it should be because this section governs both the goods sold to the foreign buyers as well as to those sent on consignment basis There are other provisions in the Act to deal with other situations The true rule of construction of a section like is if we may say so with respect as mentioned by <NAME> in <ORG> Therein the learned Judge observed I approach the question of the construction of the Exchange Control Act in the light of the principles stated by <NAME> in London and <ORG> Attorney General to which Mr <NAME> referred <NAME> said The first question I have to consider is what are the principles of construction which I must adopt in construing this Act and this order I have to bear in mind that this is a penal statute I think that the proper approach to the construction of such a statute as this is that I must construe it as I would any other instrument that is to say I must look at all the surrounding circumstances I must look at the mischief intended to be remedied I must above all give effect to the words that have been used in the section Hereinbefore we have examined the language of and its purpose We have also referred to the provisions which provide for the punishment of the contravention complained of in these cases In our opinion the language of does not permit the acceptance of the interpretation placed on it by the appellants nor are we able to come to the conclusion that the legislature intended that the offences complained of in these proceedings should be made punishable under A Section provides that where in relation to any goods exported the value as stated in the invoice is less than the amount which in the opinion of the <ORG> represents the full export value of those goods the <ORG> may issue an order requiring the person holding the shipping documents to retain possession thereof until such time as the exporter of the goods has made arrangements for the <ORG> or a person authorised by the <ORG> to receive on behalf of the exporter payment in the prescribed manner of an amount which represents in the opinion of the <ORG> the full export value of the goods Sub Section of says that for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of that section and any orders or directions made thereunder the <ORG> may require any person making any export of goods to which a notification under sub applies to exhibit contracts with his foreign buyer or other evidence to show that the full amount payable by the said buyer in respect of the goods has been or will within the prescribed period be paid in the prescribed manner If we bear in mind the scheme of the Act it is clear that so far as the <ORG> authorities are concerned all that they have to see is that no goods are exported without furnishing the declaration prescribed under In view of our above conclusion it is unnecessary for us to examine the other contention advanced on behalf of the parties ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority these appeals are dismissed with costs
