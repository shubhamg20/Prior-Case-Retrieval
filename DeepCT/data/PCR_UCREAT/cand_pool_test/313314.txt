In arriving at the conclusion about the guilt of the accused charged with the commission of a crime the court has to judge the evidence by the yardstick of probabilities its intrinsic worth and the animus of witnesses Although the benefit of every reasonable doubt should be given to the accused the courts should not at the same time reject evidence which is ex facie trustworthy on grounds which are fanciful or in the nature of conjectures In the present case <ORG> has rejected the prosecution evidence which was ex facie of a convincing nature on grounds which partake of the nature of conjectures and surmises <ORG> while rejecting the prosecution evidence made unwarranted criticism couched in harsh language about the magistrate who received the copy of I the doctor the investigating officer and the Sessions Judge who tried the case <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were tried in the court of Sessions Judge <NAME> in connection with an occurrence which took place on July in village Longowal Khurd In addition to that the aforesaid two accused were convicted under section Indian Penal Code on four counts for the injuries caused to <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> PWs and were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years on each count The State of Punjab has now come up in appeal to this Court by special leave against the judgment of <ORG> acquitting the above mentioned three accused respondents After the proceedings of the case were over <NAME> PW came back with <NAME> deceased to his house in village Longowal Khurd On arrival there <NAME> PW found <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> deceased as well as <NAME> PW <NAME> PW <NAME> PW <NAME> PW <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW present in the courtyard of <NAME> house Both the hand grenades exploded in the courtyard as a result of which <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> deceased and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> PWs received injuries <NAME> accused also gave a spear blow on the right arm of <NAME> accused dealt a kirpan blow on the nose of <NAME> PW while <NAME> accused gave a blow with his sheathed kirpan on the back of <NAME> PW The Sub Inspector then deputed a head constable to call the magistrate having jurisdiction in the area He accepted the ocular evidence produced in the case There is in our opinion considerable force in the stand taken on behalf of the appellant The evidence of Dr <NAME> who performed postmortem examination on the body of <NAME> shows that there were five injuries on the body of the deceased The evidence of Dr <NAME> who performed postmortem examination on the bodies of <NAME> and <NAME> shows that <NAME> had three lacerated wounds which could be caused with a hand grenade It is further the case of the prosecution that the fatal punctured incised wound in mid axillary line of <NAME> deceased was caused by <NAME> accused when he gave the spear blow to <NAME> deceased If their evidence can stand that test as it does in the present case there is no reason why it should not be acted upon Although Mr <NAME> has urged that there was delay in lodging the first information report we find it difficult to accept this submission The occurrence according to the prosecution case took place at As a result of the occurrence <NAME> died soon thereafter while <NAME> and <NAME> received serious injuries It must have taken some time for <NAME> and others to get out of the state of shock and regain their composure The fact that the first information report was lodged at the time it Purports to have been done can also be not disputed because the first lnformation report was received by the magistrate having jurisdiction in the area at a as is borne out by the endorsement of the magistrate on the report On the contrary the fact that <NAME> was without a shirt points to the inference that the occurrence took place in the courtyard of his house No question was put to the witness in cross examination and we can find no cogent reason as to why the evidence of <NAME> be not accepted In order to draw an inference about the falsity of the evidence of prosecution witnesses in this respect it is not enough to show that the injury on the nose of <NAME> could have been caused either with a kirpan or with a missile it is also necessary to rule out the Possibility of the said injury having been caused with a kirpan Reliance in this context was placed upon tile testimony of <NAME> DW who was conductor of Bus PNP and who has deposed about <NAME> having driven that bus to Pathankot on the day of occurrence and about that bus having reached Pathankot at We find it most difficult to accept this statement of <NAME> in the face of other evidence brought on the record and the surrounding circumstances of the case Had he been at Batala at on the day of occurrence it is not likely that he could have reached his village before or on the day of occurrence It is difficult to believe that a report about the occurrence at Longowal Khurd could have been lodged at Batala Sadar police station at if in fact the occurrence had taken place after or We are also not impressed by the reasoning that the occurrence took place at a late hour when it was not possible to fix the identity of the assailants The case of the prosecution as mentioned earlier is that the occurrence took place at The sun set on the day of occurrence it There was full moon on July and the occurrence took place a day earlier than that As the occurrence took place before sun set there could in our opinion be no difficultly in fixing the identity of the assailants Even if the occurrence had taken place after the sun set time there could still be no difficulty in finding out as to who the assailants were There is no suggestion that a lamp had been lighted at that time The fact that a large number of persons were present in the courtyard without lighting a lamp would show that there was enough light at that time If there was enough light to enable the assailants to fix the identity of <NAME> before they gave <NAME> blows to him it stands to reason that the same light would be enough for others to see as to who the assailants were We therefore have no hesitation in rejecting the argument that there was not enough light at the time of occurrence to enable the prosecution witnesses to fix identity of the culprits According to <NAME> he had received an injury during the course of a dispute with his father The learned judges of <ORG> in rejecting the prosecution evidence have made observations critical about the magistrate who received the copy of the first information report as well as about Dr <NAME> Sub Inspector <NAME> and There was enough material available according to <ORG> which could have been made better use of by a more imaginative officer without artificially or artfully advancing the time of occurrence to day time In arriv ing at the conclusion about the guilt of the accused charged with the commission of a crime the court has to judge the evidence by the yardstick of probabilities its intrinsic worth and the animus of witnesses Although the benefit of every reasonable doubt should be given to the accused the courts should not at the same time reject evidence which is ex facie trustworthy on grounds which are fanciful or in the nature of conjectures <ORG> in the present case in our opinion has rejected the prosecution evidence which was ex facie of a convincing nature on grounds which partake of the nature of conjectures and surmises We accordingly accept the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and convict the accused respondents for the offences for which they were convicted by the trial court
