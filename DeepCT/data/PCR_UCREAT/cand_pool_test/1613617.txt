One of the terms of the lease which were contained in a letter dated June written by the respondent to the appellant provided In the shops in the old chawl which are with you you have kept sub tenants The section is based upon public policy and where public policy demands even an equal participant in an illegality is allowed relief by way of restitution or rescission though not on the contract and that the plea of waiver which the appellant relied on cannot be sustained because as a result of giving effect to that plea the court would be enforcing an illegal agreement and thus contravene the statutory provisions Of Of the Act The facts giving rise to this litigation shortly stated are that the appellant was a tenant for about years in the premises known as Fida Ali Villa in Kalyan This building was purchased by the respondent who gave notice to the appellant to vacate as he wanted to construct a new building on the site of the old building There was some dispute as to the date when these new premises were let to the appellant the appellant alleging that they were let on July and the respondent that they were let on June The submission of the appellant was that the word sub tenant should be in the plural and of the respondent that it should be in the singular but whether it is in the singular or plural it does not make any difference to the principal argument advanced in this Court On January the respondent gave notice to the defendant to vacate the premises on the ground of nonpayment of rent and sub letting which it was alleged had resulted in the termination of the tenancy The defence of the appellant was that under the terms of the lease he had the right to sub let the premises He passed a decree for Rs The appellant has come to this Court by special leave Counsel for the appellant urged that there was no new tenancy after the coming into force of the Act and therefore ss and of the Act did not apply that the tenant had not sub let the premises to the sub tenants and they were merely licensees of the landlord that no new sub tenancy had been created that was confined to any other law it did not apply to contracts between the landlord and tenant and therefore it did not preclude an agreement between the parties as to sub letting that the parties were in pari delicto and therefore the plaintiff respondent could not succeed It was then argued that under of the Act there is no prohibition against a contract of sub letting the non obstante clause being confined to other laws The section when quoted runs as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in any law it shall not be lawful after the coming into operation of this Act for any tenant to sub let the whole or any part of the premises let to him or to assign or transfer in any other manner his interest therein Provided that the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette permit in any area the transfer of interest in premises held under such leases or class of leases and to such extent as may be specified in the notification The section itself makes it quite clear that it is subject to the provision of and the two sections must therefore be read together There is thus a manifest distinction between this case where the plaintiff asked the <ORG> to afford him a remedy against one who by contravening of the Act has made himself liable to eviction and those cases where the <ORG> was called upon to assist the plaintiff in enforcing an agreement the object of which was to do an illegal act It was next contended that is a provision for the protection of private rights of the landlord and unless there is in the Act itself any provision to the contrary such rights as far as they were personal rights may be parted with or renounced by the landlord But it was argued on behalf of the appellant that according to the law of India the duty of a pleader is to set up the facts upon which he relied and not any legal inference to be drawn from them and as he had set up all the circumstances from which the plea of waiver could be inferred lie should be allowed to raise and argue it at this stage even though it had not been raised at any previous stage not even in the statement of case filed in this <ORG> and he relied upon <ORG> <NAME> Assuming that to be so and proceeding on the facts found in this case the plea of waiver cannot be raised because as a result of giving effect to that plea the <ORG> would be enforcing an illegal agreement and thus contravene the statutory provisions of based on public policy and produce the very result which the statute prohibits and makes illegal Wherever the illegality appears whether the evidence comes from one side or the other the disclosure is fatal to the case A waiver is nothing unless it amounts to a release It signifies nothing more than an intention not to insist upon the right In <NAME> Gilbert <NAME> said Besides there is still further reason why the trustees should not be estopped for this is a public Act of <ORG> and the Courts are bound to take notice that the trustees under this Act had no power to mortgage the toll houses it may be for the benefit of the parties to the difference must be regarded as inserted in the interest of the public also In that case there was a provision made by the <ORG> that disputes mentioned in the section of the Act were to be determined by an Expert nominated by <ORG> and it was contended that though not in the strict technical sense estoppel it was a waiver of the provisions introduced into the Statute for the benefit of private rights In our opinion therefore the judgment of <ORG> is sound and the appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs
