DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH SEN THOMAS ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT WITH Civil Appeal Nos THOMAS The question raised in all these appeals is whether an assessee is liable to pay interest under section A of the Bengal finance Sales Tax Act on the turnover tax for the period during which recovery of the tax amount was stopped by orders of <ORG> The effect of the new provision was that they imposed a tax on the turnover of a dealer whose annual aggregate gross turnover exceeded Rs The provisions came into force on These appellants were concerned with section of the Act and hence they filed writ petitions before <ORG> challenging the validity of the aforesaid provision thus liability of the appellants to pay tax on the turnover became conclusive and appellants remitted the tax amount accordingly <ORG> before which the appellants challenged the demand for payment of interest dismissed the petitions filed by the appellants Where a registered or certified dealer furnishes a return referred to in section in respect of any period by the prescribed date or thereafter but fails to make full payment of tax payable in respect of such period by such prescribed date of thereafter but fails to make full payment of tax payable in respect of such period by such prescribed date he shall pay a simple interest at the rate of two per centum for each English calendar month of default from the first day of such month next following the prescribed date up to the month preceding the month of full payment of such tax or up to the month prior to the month of assessment under section in respect of such period Where a registered or certified dealer fails to furnish a return referred to in section in respect of any period by the prescribed date or thereafter before the assessment under section in respect of such period and on such assessment full amount of tax payable for such period is found not to have been paid by him by such prescribed date he shall pay a simple interest at the rate of two per centum for each English calendar month of default from the first day of the month next following the prescribed date up to the month preceding the month of full payment of tax for such period or up to the month prior to the month of assessment under section in respect of such period whichever is earlier upon so much of the amount of tax payable by him according to such assessment as remains unpaid at the end of each such month of default Where a dealer fails to make payment of any tax payable after assessment by the date specified in the notice issued under sub section of section for payment thereof he shall pay a simple interest at the rate of two per centum for each English calendar month of default from the first day the month next following the date specified in such notice up to the month preceding the month of full payment of such tax or up to the month preceding the month of commencement of proceedings under sub section of section whichever is earlier upon so much of the amount of tax payable by him according to such notice as remains unpaid at the end of each such month of default It must be pointed out at the outset itself that nobody has a case that appellants are liable to pay interest by virtue of sub section thereto According to the counsel since appellants have furnished returns and paid the tax as per such returns there is no ability to pay interest on the turnover tax because sub section contemplates a situation where there was failure to pay tax in accordance with the returns furnished and sub section contemplates a situation where no return has been furnished at all First is that he should have furnished a return within the prescribed date in accordance with the terms referred to in Section Second is that he should make full payment of the tax payable under law So the initial aspect to be considered is whether the first obligation has been discharged by the appellants If a dealer has furnished only a truncated return that cannot be regarded as furnishing the return referred to in Section It is a different matter if the dealer would have committed some marginal errors in the return or there were some mistakes of a minor nature if that be so the consequence is that they have failed to furnish a return which is referred to in section The corollary is that there was failure to furnish the return as envisaged in sub section It is well settled that in interpreting a taxing statute normally there is no scope for consideration of principles of equity There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax It was the Constitutional Validity of Section which was challenged by the appellants in the earlier writ petitions before <ORG> and which finally ended up in upholding of it validity Hence there was no question of the assess waiting for the determination and the turnover as there was no dispute on that aspect When appellants had the advantage of keeping the amount of tax without paying it to the <ORG> exchequer only because the High court granted orders restraining the <ORG> from recovering that amount from the assessee no act of the <ORG> shall cause prejudice to any party On the contrary it is well neigh settled that there is always a presumption in favour of constitutionality of a legislative act We therefore concur with the view taken by <ORG> and dismiss all these appeals
