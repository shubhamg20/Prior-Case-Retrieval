In the suit from which Appeal No is brought the plaintiffs are claiming a declaration that they are permanent tenants of the suit land whilst Appeal No is an appeal in a suit brought by the landlord defendant in the first suit claiming possession of the suit property on the ground that the plaintiffs are annual tenants There is first the property shown on the exhibited plan within the parallelogram A which I will refer to as the A property and then there is the rest of the suit property partly to the north and partly to the south of the A property which I will refer to as the property Then the next document is exhibit which is a letter written in the year by the <NAME> to the desai of Nippani relating to a quarrel relating to land of the desai in Sankeshvar a year The plaintiffs rely on that document but the learned Judge held that it was not proved and in my opinion the learned Judge decision on that point was correct We have therefore no actual documentary evidence as to the plaintiffs title to the A land at any rate before about and the plaintiffs rely on Section of the Bombay Land Revenue Code as raising in their favour a presumption of permanent tenancy where by reason of the antiquity of a tenancy no satisfactory evidence of its commencement is forthcoming and there is not any such evidence of the period of its intended duration if any agreed upon between the landlord and tenant or those under whom they respectively claim title or any usage of the locality as to duration of such tenancy it shall as against the immediate landlord of the tenant be presumed to be co extensive with the duration of the tenure of such landlord and of those who derive title under him The plaintiffs say that by reason of the antiquity of this tenancy there is no satisfactory evidence as to its commencement or as to its duration and the answer of the defendant is that the three documents to which I have referred the documents of and establish this that in those respective yelars somebody other than the plaintiffs was in possession of the property and therefore it is said the plaintiffs possession must have started after somewhere between and It has been held by this Court in a good many cases that Section of the Bombay Land Revenue Code in referring to the absence of satisfactory evidence of the commencement of a tenancy does not mean that there must be satisfactory evidence as to the exact date of commencement that is the day on which the tenancy commenced but that it is sufficient if the evidence shows that the tenancy must have commenced in Here it is suggested by the defendant that as the period is fixed between and there is sufficient evidence as to the commencement There is as I have pointed out no definite evidence that the plaintiffs were not in possession before because we have not seen the actual <ORG> There was no particular reason why the <NAME> rent roll should have referred to the names of the cultivators of land or to the rent they paid where the land had been granted out to the predecessors of the defendant at a fixed rent of Rs Therefore I am not prepared to say that on those documents I consider that there is any satisfactory evidence as to the commencement of the plaintiffs title in respect of the A property or as to the duration of their tenancy there is no evidence at all as to the duration of the tenancy There is nothing in the future history of the land to affect that presumption Now coming to property the plaintiffs contention was that they entered into possession of that land as permanent tenants in the year on the terms of an agreement which is exhibit From both property A and property have been held together at one rent and if there is a presumption that the plaintiffs interest in property A is that of a permanent tenant the mixing up of that land with property suggests a similar interest in property A uniform rent was paid for both properties down to the year at the rate of Rs On that point of law there are some relevant decisions of <ORG> There is first of all the case of <NAME> <NAME> I A in which it was laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> that they were unable to affirm as a general proposition of law that a person who is in fact in possession of land under a tenancy or occupancy title can by a mere assertion in a judicial proceeding and the lapse of six or twelve years without that assertion having been successfully challenged obtain a title as an under proprietor to the lands Whether a tenancy is permanent or not must depend on the facts of the case and the agreement between the parties and not on mere assertions Therefore the plaintiff suit in my opinion was bad but Mr <NAME> has asked for leave to amend his claim by basing his right to possession on the notice of September exhibit and on terms as to costs we are prepared to give that leave It is said that it is really a notice to enhance rent or at any rate only a contingent notice to quit but as I read the document I think it is a notice to quit on March In the case of defendants Nos and a registered letter containing the notice was sent to them duly addressed and service is alleged to have been refused There are I know some authorities in this Court to the contrary but it seems to me impossible to say that a letter has been served so as to bring the contents to the notice of the person to whom the letter is addressed if the agent for service states that in fact the notice was not served although the reason may have been that the addressee declined to accept it It is urged that there are certain words viz But it has been strongly urged on behalf of the appellants that although they did not get rights of permanent tenancy either by their grant or under Section they acquired them by adverse possession and for that reliance has been placed upon a deposition of one of the ancestors of the present appellants <NAME> who deposed in previous revenue proceedings that they were holding the lands as permanent tenants by virtue of the grant of It is urged that since that assertion the tenants have been holding the land claiming to be permanent tenants and that the landlord has accepted the rent and has not disputed their status as permanent tenants Now in order that a person can acquire rights by adverse possession he must intend to do so in a manner which must be clear and unambiguous In fact it appears that between in which according to the appellants their possession began and when the first assertion was made they have given rent to the landlord for which there are receipts So we have not here the case of entire strangers or trespassers entering on the land for the first time and claiming to hold it adversely as permanent tenants but I agree that that decision which turns on the special facts of that case does not apply to the facts of the present case at alt In fact that decision was given on the basis that in that case the relationship of landlord and tenant had ceased between the parties after the assertion of permanent tenancy and that the rent was taken by the landlord in the name of the original mukarraridars and receipts were also given in their names only and when the tenants demanded receipts in their own names the landlord refused to give such receipts and thereafter no rent was paid
