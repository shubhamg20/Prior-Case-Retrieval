From the date of the gift there was no occasion for partition It is the case of the first defendant appellant that the gift was made to his ancestor on account of his being the <ORG>a guru and those properties together with the rest which form an accretion to that estate are attached to that office of <ORG>a Guru cannot be separated therefrom and are therefore impartible Mutts are usually associations of Sanyasis or celibates devoted to divine worship who give upadesam or instruction to deserving candidates There is no doubt the residence of the first defendant is generally called a mutt It appears that a few days before his father death in the presence of the heads of certain other mutts the first defendant was taught Rama Mantram by his father and a few days after his death he was installed as the head of the mutt It is said that no other person is entitled to sit on the gadi and the right to sit on the gadi is supposed to have been conferred upon the first defendant and his predecessors as they were the gurus of the royal family of Tanjore The question for our consideration is however whether there are properties attached to this office or belong to the mutt as such and for that reason whether they are impartible In order to decide this question we have to consider the documentary evidence adduced It is not stated to have been given to him for the maintenance of the office nor was it given to him as the head of the mutt The sanad itself is in the form of an order issued to his officials by the Maharaja reciting that these grants have been made to Sri <NAME> with the exception of exhibit where he is styled <NAME> There is also a direction in the sanad which is translated thus Let it be conducted from sons to grandsons in succession In the case of the properties which were granted for charitable and religious reference the purpose is recited in the sanad itself exhibit and there is a specific direction let the charity be conducted perpetually The grandfather of the first defendant died in the year and in his widow presented a petition to <ORG> in which after referring to her husband death and his adoption before his death of the first defendant father she stated that his installation ceremony including procession was not performed either by her husband or the Maharaja to qualify him for my husband adhinam and the Maharaja priesthood and she stated that until the abhishekam is performed he is ineligible for the priesthood There are statements made by the widow about her husband atheenam and the necessity of an installation which support the first defendant If the <NAME> was interested in those properties it is scarcely likely that the <NAME> officials would have refrained from any such interference more especially when we take into consideration the fact that the native <NAME>s in ancient days actively interfered in the management of religious institutions In he made a gift of certain properties to his foster daughter and in he sold certain other items of property for Rs But there is no suggestion anywhere of the properties appertaining to either the office or to the mutt Suits were brought not against the first defendant solely but against the first defendant and his brothers with reference to these properties by third parties and in the written statement filed by the first defendant and his brothers and in the Razi that followed see exhibits and the properties were treated as joint family properties and then a decree for specific performance was passed against the first defendant and also against his brothers not against him alone see exhibit Similarly he filed suits with his brothers as co plaintiffs All this evidence can lead only to one conclusion and no document has been referred to before the date of this plaint in which the first defendant ever asserted his exclusive title as against the other members of the family Assuming that the defendant predecessors were holders of an office or heads of a mutt they were also competent to acquire property for the benefit of themselves and descendants including the female members of the family and there is no presumption feat properties acquired by them were acquired for the office or mutt and not for their own use and benefit It would require strong evidence to show that these properties also were devoted to the office or mutt There is nothing in the account books to show that those were treated as trust property It was further contended that the management of the family properties devoted to charitable or religious uses descended according to the rule of primogeniture and that the plaintiff as a junior member is not entitled on partition to any share therein It is now well settled that the right of management ordinarily descends to the natural heirs of the donee Mayne and there is nothing to take the present case out of the rule The way in which the right of management is enjoyed is stated by the learned Judges as follows Except in the few oases in which the hereditary office may be descendible only to a single heir the usage and custom generally is that along with oilier properties the office of manager is divided also in the sense that it is agreed to be held and the duties thereof discharged in rotation by each member or branch of the family the duration of their turns being proportionate to their shares in the family property We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs
