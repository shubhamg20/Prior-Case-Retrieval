By an agreement of reference dated the th September the matters in dispute were referred to the sole arbitration of one <NAME> without the intervention of the <ORG> On the st January the defendants gave notice that they would move that the award should be recorded as an adjustment or compromise of the suit and for a decree being passed in terms thereof The motion was heard before <NAME> who dismissed it on the ground that the award could not be recorded as an adjustment under Order XXIII Rule while as the agreement to refer had been made without the intervention of the <ORG> the application could not be made under the Second Schedule of the Civil Procedure Code We are dealing with an agreement to refer made by the parties to a suit without the intertion of the <ORG> followed by an award There was a conflict of decisions between the Calcutta Madras and Bombay High <ORG>s on the one side and the Allahabad High <ORG> on the other on the question whether the <ORG> could pass a decree on an adjustment except with consent of the parties and the addition of the words where it is proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> have been added to set at rest that conflict I held that Section excluded any such applications being made under Order XXIII Rule as that section directed that all references to arbitration whether by an order in a suit or otherwise and all proceedings thereunder should be governed by the provisions contained in the Second Schedule save so far as it was otherwise provided by the Indian Arbitration Act or by any other law for the time being in force But beyond that it would be contrary to all canons of construction of statutes that where an Act lays down that certain proceedings should be governed by the provisions contained therein relating thereto save where provision was made by some other law in force the provisions of the Act itself should be considered as laying down some other law for the time being in force It has been contended that none of the provisions covers the case of an agreement to refer made by the parties to a suit without the intervention of the <ORG> it was held that an agreement to refer by parties to a suit could be filed under Section of the Code of The facts in that case were that after a suit had been tiled the matters in dispute were referred to arbitration The Subordinate Judge before whom the application to set aside the award was heard overruled all objection and passed a decree in terms of the award The Judge who admitted the appeal being of opinion that no appeal lay allowed the application to be amended so as to make it an application for revision in case the <ORG> that heard the appeal should decide that no appeal lay The question whether or not an appeal lay or was prohibited by the last clause of Section of the Civil Procedure Code of was referred to a Full Bench which decided that no appeal lay Thereafter an application for revision was entertained and the decree of the Subordinate Judge was modified Then at occurs the following passage In cases falling under Heads II and III the provisions relating to cases under Head I are to be observed so far as applicable But there is this difference which does not seem to have been always kept in view in the <ORG>s in India In cases falling under Head I the agreement to refer and the application to the <ORG> founded upon it must have the concurrence of all parties concerned and the actual reference is the order of the <ORG> Eventually it was held that there was no appeal from the decree and that the application for revision was incompetent That is perfectly correct but the learned Judges were only concerned with the question whether the application be them an agreement to refer by parties in a suit was cover by para of the Second Schedule Still it is clear that the second Head in the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> case covers only arbitrations by parties who have not had recourse to litigation and that therefore an agreement to refer by parties to a suit cannot be tiled under para of the Second Schedule In my opinion however the description of the first Head of arbitrations makes it clear that the parties to a litigation who desire to refer their disputes to arbitration must go to the Court for an order of reference if they wish the arbitration proceedings to continue under the provisions of the Second Schedule And there is no reason why they should proceed under para when paras to prescribe the procedure to be followed in a most exhaustive manner It will not stay its own proceedings merely because one party brings to its notice that there has been an agreement to refer the suit to arbitration Nor if there is an award will it proceed in the manner provided by any of the provisions of the Second Schedule But there is no reason why when the award is brought to its notice it should not try the issue whether the award is not binding on the parties under the general principles of the law of contract by proceeding under Order XXIII Rule But when parties have been negotiating for a settlement and one party considers a settlement has been arrived at which the other party denies or where there has been a settlement which one party seeks to avoid on any of the grounds on which an agreement can be avoided recourse is had to Order XXIII Rule so that the <ORG> may determine whether an adjustment has actually been made or whether an adjustment made is one which can be recorded In such a case the true position appears to be that the <ORG> will not look at the arbitration proceedings but only at the consent terms as it makes no difference whether those terms have been arrived at by agreement between the parties acting by themselves or have been settled by a third party chosen by them There is no particular reason in either case for having recourse to Order XXIII Rule This is in effect what has happened in this case The defendant obtained a rule to stay proceedings on the ground that after issue joined and notice of trial given the parties had agreed to refer the cause to arbitration and that an award had been made Then the question could be tried in the suit and not by motion whether the award was binding on the parties the order made was The suit will be set down for hearing when the first defendant will in the first instance proceed to satisfy <ORG> that the adjustment has been properly and justly obtained and the plaintiff will then be entitled to urge any ground that may be open to her to show that the award which is sought to be enforced against her as an adjustment ought not to be recorded and a decree passed in terms thereof Whether the suit is set down for hearing an application to record an adjustment or is set down for trial an order must be passed recording or refusing to record the adjustment as an appeal lies against such an order though not against the decree passed in terms of an adjustment the appellant contended inter alia that the award was falsely and fraudulently made by the arbitrators purporting to make the same without holding any meetings or examining any books of account and without giving the defendant any opportunity of appearing before them in support of his case These questions do not appear even to have been considered by <ORG> or <ORG> which confirmed the decree passed in the terms of the award First it is said that Chapter XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code is an exhaustive exposition of the power to refer to arbitration pending a suit I can find nothing however in Chapter XXX VII which invalidates a proceeding not in accordance with its provisions beyond the result that non compliance deprives a party of a right to claim the consequences the Chapter prescribes and I therefore hink the objection cannot succeed that a party objecting to an award had to submit to a decree in terms of the award without his objections being heard and there are grounds for such a conclusion from the bare record of the case as reported If that had really been decided I should be inclined to say it was wrong but it does not appear whether the defendant actually persisted that his objection should be heard or merely objected to the procedure It all comes to this that a party to a suit setting up an award by arbitration out of <ORG> must satisfy the <ORG> that there has been an adjustment by lawful agreement which entitles him to ask that the suit should be stopped and a decree passed in terms thereof It may be as well to summarise the procedure to be adopted by parties in a suit who enter into an agreement to refer the matter in dispute in the suit or part of it to arbitration The appeal must be allowed but think the order giving time to the defendant to file the award was also wrong I am told that he has now filed his written statement so that he can apply to have the suit set down for trial on the issue whether the award is binding The questions for determination may be stated as follows Do paragraphs and of Schedule II of the Civil Procedure Code apply to cases where the matters referred to arbitration are already the subject matter of a suit between the parties to the reference If they do apply what effect does a decree under paragraph have upon the suit If the parties to a suit agree to refer the matters in dispute to arbitration without the intervention of the <ORG> and an award is made on such submission prior to the decision of the suit can the submission and award be recorded under Order XXIII Rule Civil Procedure Code as an agreement adjusting or compromising the suit and a decree be passed in terms of the award If questions and are answered in the negative what remedy is open to a person interested in the award to enforce it I agree with the learned Chief Justice that the first question should be answered in the negative I also concur with his view in the same case that paragraphs to are intended to prescribe the only provisions in the Schedule by which the <ORG> jurisdiction to determine the matter in dispute after a regular hearing can be ousted by a submission to arbitration and an award thereon These considerations apply as much to paragraph as to paragraph and in <NAME> case it seems to me their Lordships of <ORG> intended Head III of those specified in the judgment at to exclude just as much as Head II the case dealt with in Head I viz Where the parties to a litigation desire to refer to arbitration any matter in difference between them in the suit The decree could it seems to me at most operate as rets judicata under Section Civil Procedure Code as being a decision in a former suit cf But have come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient ground for our differing from the view taken in <NAME> <NAME> I Bom and that the question should accordingly be answered in the affirmative at any rate until <NAME> <NAME>s is overruled by <ORG> or <ORG> There is certainly a very considerable weight of authority in favour of the view that an agreement to refer the matter in suit to arbitration and the award made thereon may amount to an adjustment of the suit by lawful agreement within the meaning of Order XXIII Rule Civil Procedure Code and the corresponding Section of the Code of am not sure if this is correct but at any rate there are the following reported opinions to that effect <NAME> Premji Pragji I Bom His objection that the <ORG> jurisdiction cannot be ousted applies to a case like the one there under consideration where there was a reference to arbitration subsequent to the commencement of the action without the consent of one of the parties Order XXIII Rule Civil Procedure Code contains provisions corresponding to the plea of accord and satisfaction after writ referred to in the case just cited The principle of treating an agreement to refer to arbitration after suit together with the award thereon as on the same footing as a direct settlement between the parties themselves for the purposes of such a plea appears to me to be one which has very high authority in its favour There is an agreement to settle the matters in dispute in the way decided on by the arbitrator and as soon as he decides the result is an ascertained settlement as much as if the parties had settled the dispute themselves I would however qualify the above by predicating that the award to be effective for such a plea must be a valid one according to the general rules of law governing the validity of awards in arbitration proceedings was that the award was improperly passed but no reference is made to this in the reported arguments of the appellant counsel pp The <ORG> under that rule has to be satisfied that the suit has been adjusted by a lawful agreement or compromise and even though there may have been a lawful agreement to refer the matters in dispute to arbitration still there will have been no real adjustment if the reference has merely resulted in an invalid award I Article at but otherwise I take it that the implied objection to perform the award of the arbitrator will not be extended beyond an obligation to perform an award which to use the language of the Privy Council in <NAME> <NAME> I Cal has ordinary legal validity i an award which is not a legal nullity or liable to be set aside for misconduct In the latter view there is no agreement to accept an award of the kind just mentioned so as to bring the ease under Order XXIII Rule With due deference it seems to me that to make a distinction between a case where both parties accept the award which <NAME> in <NAME> case at says will constitute an adjustment under the rule and a case where one of the parties dishonestly repudiates his submission as in <NAME> case or raises unsustainable objections to the validity of the award is giving the latter an advantage which is contrary to the terms of Order XXIII Rule of <NAME> <NAME> The <ORG> has shown its approval of the decisions that such a dispute did not prevent the application of the provisions in question by the insertion of the words where it is proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> that at the commencement of the rule The view taken on this point in <NAME> <NAME> is I submit correct It seems to me to be a case where the rule of construction laid down by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Beav There is no clear evidence of any intention of the <ORG> to exclude Order XXIII Rule from this benefit and as I have already said there is a presumption against any alteration of the law regarding Section of the Code of as laid down in <NAME> <NAME> I do not think that the words other law as used in the Code must necessarily mean some law other than that contained in the Code Thus in Section of the Code a general right of appeal not restricted to certain grounds as a second appeal is by Section is given from every decree passed by any <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction Otherwise there is a repugnancy between the general right conferred by Section and this specific enactment It may be noted that the provisions of the Second Schedule are not given legislative effect as if enacted in the body of this Code like the provisions of the First Schedule under so that they can only come under the saving clause in Section by treating them as any other law for the time being in force The case is stronger with regard to Order XXIII Rule which under a has effect as if enacted in the body of the Code and is therefore on an equal footing in this respect to Section Also other law in a is clearly a law other than the Indian Arbitration Act whereas in Section it might be argued that other law must mean a law other than the Code As to the fourth question I agree with the learned Chief Justice that if Order XXIII Rule cannot be availed of either party who wishes to enforce the award can file a suit to enforce it and apply for a stay of the original suit As to the question of the proper procedure for having the award considered by the <ORG> in the suit it seems to me that Original Side Rule only debars the <ORG> from passing a decree unless the suit appears on the trial board There is no thing in it therefore to prevent the <ORG> from proceeding at any rate up to the stage of ordering the agreement comprised in the agreement to refer and the award thereon to be recorded under Order XXIII Rule > and it can then direct the suit to be set down on the trial board for passing a decree in accordance with this order Also there is the precedent of the rule in England that if an action is compromised out of <ORG> and the compromise is not made an order of <ORG> it cannot be enforced by motion in the action Halsbury Laws of England Vol At the same time to prevent possible misapprehension I may say that we are both agreed that so far as the mofussil is concerned the requisite proceedings can be taken on a mere application to have the alleged agreement recorded under Order XXIII Rule and that a formal pleading of the award under Order VIII Rule in unnecessary
