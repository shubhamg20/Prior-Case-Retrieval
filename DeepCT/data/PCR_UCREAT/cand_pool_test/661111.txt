The question referred to this Court under Section of the Income tax Act arises out of the assessment for the year the previous year in relation to which ended on th August was incurred by the assessee the expenditure could be claimed at all as deduction under Section xv of the Act and if it could be claimed as a lawful deduction did the fact that the amount was expended not in the relevant year of account but only in the year of account bar the grant of relief in the assessment year The assessee maintained its accounts on the mercantile basis We have already set out the terms of Clause of the contract Which of these three alternatives gave the greatest monetary advantage to <ORG> at any given point of time with the corresponding monetary liability on the assessee it was not possible to guess because no claim even was made by <ORG> in It should betaken as well settled now that without statutory warrant and there is none in Section xv deductions are not premissible for anticipated losses even if they are inevitable nor for contingent liabilities The assessee company carried on the business of managing factory canteens The company claimed the latter set of amounts as admissible deductions in computing its assessable profits It was the same principle that was laid down in <ORG> <ORG> at page A prudent commercial man may put part of the profits made in one year to reserve and carry forward that reserve to the next year in order to provide against an unexpected or it may be an inevitable loss which he foresees will fall upon his business during the next year On the contrary the balance of profits and gains is determined independently altogether of the way in which the trader uses that balance when he has got it and if he puts part of it to reserve and carries it forward into the next year that has no effect whatever upon his taxable income for the year in which he makes the profit At page Lord <NAME> observed The appellants say that in an Income tax sense this sum is a proper debit against the profit of the three months in question because although it was neither spent in fact nor incurred as a debt in that time it was a prospective liability which would have to be satisfied at another time and as soon as possible It seems to me like saying that a man is entitled to charge supper in his expenses for Sunday night because though he went supperless to bed he orders something extra for his breakfast on Monday morning In <NAME> and <NAME> Principles of Income tax Taxation at page the learned authors quoted the dictum of the Lord President in <ORG> <ORG> It seems to follow that if in the earlier period there is only a provisional or contingent liability it is not until it has been subsequently determined to be an actual liability by admission or decision that it can properly be brought into computation II paragraph at page In computing the profits of a trade it is the normal accountancy practice to allow as an expense any sum in respect of liabilities which have accrued over the accounting period and to make a deduction of such sums from the profits Following the decision in <ORG> <NAME> Inspector of Taxes however it appears that the nature of liabilities which may be deducted on business and accountancy principles does not accord with the nature of liabilities deductible for income tax purposes For income tax purposes it was held that a distinction must be drawn between an actual i legal liability which is deductible and a liability which is future or contingent and for which no deduction can be made In view of the true principle applicable to relating back of expenses we see no scope for extending the principle laid down in <NAME> case to the claim of the assessee Our conclusion on this part of the case is that even if the sum the assessee had eventually to pay in as liquidated damages for breach of its contractual obligations had constituted a permissible deduction under Section xv of the Act such a claim could not have been allowed in the assessment year in computing the assessable profits for the accounting year We shall next deal with the question whether the requirements of Section xv could be satisfied i whether the expenditure had been laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the assessee business no doubt they do run rather close to each other but I cannot help thinking that there is a distinction between a and It is conceivable such things sometimes happen that there may be cases in which a thing might fall alternatively it might be either within a or within but none the less I do think that there is a distinction to be drawn between the two a relates to disbursements that means something or other which the trader pay out I think some sort of volition is indicated What Lord <NAME> observed in the same case has been applied as consistently by Courts in India as in England These words are used in other rules and appear to me to mean for the purpose of enabling a person to carry on and earn profits in the trade etc It must be made for the purposes of earning the profits The principle laid down by <NAME> in the Commissioners of Inland Revenue <NAME> Co Ltd and followed by him in The Commissioners of Inland Revenue Alexander Von Glehn Co Ltd was approved of by <ORG> in <NAME> case Woodifield A at at said that it is impossible to frame any formula which shall describe what is a loss connected with or arising out of a trade but it seems to me that a penal liability of this kind cannot be regarded as a loss connected with or arising out of a trade At page the learned Master of the Rolls pointed out that no moral obliquity attached itself to the conduct of the assessee who had to pay a penalty but he observed that that made no difference This penalty was imposed because of an infraction of the law and that does not seem to me to be any more than the expense which had to be paid in the case of Strong Woodifield A at at appeared to Lord <NAME> to be a disbursement or expense which was laid out or expended for the purpose of such trade nor does it seem to me though this is rather more questionable to be a sum paid on account of a loss connected with or arising out of such trade Warrington observed at page Now it cannot be said that the disbursement in the present case is made in any way for the purpose of the trade or for the purpose of earning the profits of the trade The principles laid down in <NAME> case and <NAME> case were applied in <NAME> <NAME> and Chemicals Ltd The law infraction of which was alleged in that case was the law of the United States There is no evidence that it was paid wholly and exclusively for that purpose At page <NAME> observed Now applying these two tests to the facts of the case in my opinion both the tests are satisfied because the loss is incidental to the trade because it was in the course of its business of selling stationery that the directors were charged with having contravened the law and also in its capacity as a trader that the company was called upon to defend its directors and the salesman Earlier the learned Chief Justice pointed out that the expenses for the litigation were not incurred by the persons charged with the offences themselves but they were incurred by the company in order to save those persons from the consequences of the prosecution We have referred to this case only to show that the principles laid down in <NAME> <NAME> were not departed from in deciding whether the deduction claimed by the assessee <ORG> under Section xv was permissible An appeal was filed against an interlocutory order in a pending suit We fail to see how this decision where the facts as found were totally different from those we have to consider in this case helps the assessee The claim of the asses see company that the payment constituted a permissible deduction was upheld by <ORG> affirming the decision of <ORG> At page <ORG> pointed out there is no evidence upon which the Commissioners could find that the object of <ORG> in entering into the compromise was anything except to obtain payment of as much of the balance of the account as they could persuade Mr <NAME> to agree to and that account being as I have said a trading account it seems to me that the compromise was a compromise effected for the purpose of the company trade and for the purpose of enabling them to recover the payment of a trading debt owing to them from a customer which would come into computation in their trading account At page the learned Judges pointed out When it appears that the inclusion in the newspaper of matter alleged by claimants to be defamatory is a regular and almost unavoidable incident of publishing it so that the claims directly flow from acts done for no other purpose than earning revenue acts forming the essence of the business no valid reason remains for denying that the money was wholly and exclusively expended for the production of assessable income Earlier at page the learned Judges observed None of the libels or supposed libels was published with any other object in view than the sale of the newspaper The thing which produced the assessable income was the thing which exposed the tax payer to the liability or claim discharged by the expenditure The assessee claimed the amount paid by the assessee under the decree as lawful deduction After referring to the principles laid down in <NAME> case and <NAME> case the learned Chief Justice observed at page In the present case the assessee was not fined for a breach of law but was made to pay damages for a breach of the contract entered into The learned Counsel for the assessee invited us to differ from the principles laid down in <NAME> case I As we shall presently show it is not necessary to rest our decision in this case merely on the basis that the conduct of the assessee before us when he committed the breach of the contract was palpably dishonest Possibly it was only the argument that was set out because the learned Judge observed next For the respondent company it was argued that even were the damages or akin to damages for fraud and deceit it would still be entitled to deduct that sum in computing its taxable profits but as this question in my view does not arise I say nothing about it The last of the cases we have to refer Tto on the question of damages is <NAME> Hall In that case the assessee <NAME> had to pay damages and costs in an action for malicious libel After referring to the principle laid down in <NAME> <NAME> A Macnaghten observed at page In the present case the loss which the Appellant has sustained damages and costs is in one sense a loss connected with his trade It is a case that falls it seems to me exactly within the words of Lord <NAME> who said that the losses cannot be deducted if they are mainly incidental to some other vocation or fall on the trader in some character other than that of a trader It was only remotely connected with his trade as a sugar broker As we said these cases were all virtually decided on the application of the test laid down in Strong WoodifieldL It must be made for the purposes of earning the profits The contractual obligation the performance of which the asessee defaulted was to export the coffee which had been sold to it at a concessional price only because it was earmarked for export abroad The assessee could and should have carried on its business in coffee in conformity with the obligations imposed upon it no doubt by a contract but under the authority of the Coffee Market Expansion Act and in furtherance of the policy of control that underlay that Act That is why we said that it may not be necessary to rest our decision in this case on the rule laid down in <NAME> case a I In out opinion it is the principle laid down in <NAME> case that should be extended and applied to negative the claim of the assessee in this case Or in the words of <NAME> Were these fines made or paid for the purpose of earning the profits The answer seems to me to be obvious that they were not they were unfortunate and in this case we would add justly deserved incidents which followed after the profits had been earned We answer the question referred to us in the negative and against the assessee Since the assessee has failed the assessee will pay the costs of this
