The judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal against a judgment of <ORG> at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section iv of the Indian Income tax Act The <ORG> however agreed to refer two questions of law to <ORG> at Bombay namely Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under the provisions of section iv of the Indian Income tax Act Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section iv or under section of the Indian Income tax Act A supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property <ORG> held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment be understood in the same sense as in sub clause that is to say the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged such sums not being capital sums the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase annual charge occur ring in section iv and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words <NAME> however took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge Section of the City of Bombay Municipal Act authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city Section lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections to every year and the provisions the said sec tions and of sections and shall be applicable each year The duty to collect the tax is laid on the municipality and it does so in the same manner as in the case of the municipal property tax The learned Attorney General on the other hand argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance the charge is not an annual charge Great emphasis was laid on the word due used in section of the Municipal Act and it was said that as the taxes do not become due under the Act unless the time for the payment arrives no charge comes into existence till then and that the charge is not an annual charge section which allows a deduction in respect of any sums paid on account of land revenue It was observed that land revenue stands on the same footing as municipal taxes and that as the legislature made a special provision for deduction of sums payable in regard to land revenue but not in respect of sums paid on account of municipal taxes that circumstance indicated that the deduction was not allowable In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section of the Bombay Municipal Act Without determining the exact meaning of the words used by the statute it seems to us it was not possible to arrive at the conclusion that the taxes were not within the ambit of the clause The deductions allowed in section under the head Income from business proceed on a different footing and a construction of section with the aid of section is apt to mislead If no default is made no charge is ever enforceable and whenever there is a charge it can be increased or reduced during the year either by payment or by additional borrowing In <ORG> <ORG> it was held by <ORG> that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word annual must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence The result is that this appeal is allowed and the two questions which were referred to <ORG> by <ORG> and cited above are answered in the affirmative The appellants will have their costs in the appeal
