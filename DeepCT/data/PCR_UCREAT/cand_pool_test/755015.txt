This is an appeal filed under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act against the order of <ORG> Delhi dated dismissing an application filed before <ORG> under Section A of the said Act for the payment of compensation They filed the aforesaid application as heirs of the said <NAME> claiming a sum of Rs as compensation arising out of an accident which took place on at Farash Khana Bus Stop Road at about resulting in the death of the aforesaid <NAME> The applicants further stated that the driver crossed the bus No Dlp which was standing so closely that the deceased was crushed between the two buses and as a result of the same he sustained very serious injuries on the chest that he was then taken to the Irwin Hospital where as a result of the said injuries he died at about on the same day that the accident was caused on account of the rash and negligent acts of the Conductor and the Driver of the bus No Dlp of route No that the said Conductor and Driver respondents Nos and were the employees of respondents Nos to namely <ORG> through the Secretary to <ORG> Government of India New Delhi <ORG> and <ORG> through the Officer in charge Scindia House New Delhi that the accident took place during the course of their employment and that therefore the respondents to were also liable to pay the compensation claimed by the applicants <ORG> which have seven branches in all important places in India that the deceased was assessed to income tax on the yearly income of Rs The application was contested by respondents and <ORG> and the Conductor and the Driver of the offending bus They filed a reply to the application raising some preliminary objections namely that the motor vehicles of <ORG> were exempted from the provisions of Chapter Viii of the Motor Vehicles Act by the Central Government by a notification dated that on repeal of <ORG> Act of the notification etc issued under the said Act remained in force by virtue of Section of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and the vehicles of the respondent No were also exempted from the provisions of Chapter Viii of the Motor Vehicles Act under which the present application was made and therefore the present application was nto maintainable that no notice as required under Section of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act was Riven and that the application was bad as no notice under Section of the Civil Procedure Code was served on the Government of India On the merits they stated inter alia that the deceased attempted to board bus No Dlp which was in a running condition and in his attempt to board the moving bus a portion of his body which was outside the bus struck against the stationary bus No Dip as a result of which he fell down from the said Bus No that on bus No Dlp was proceeding on route No from Fountain to Rajouri Garden that when the said bus reached the bus stop at Farash Khana near Lahori Gate another bus No Dlp was standing at the same bus stop that the bus No Dlp which was full to its standing and sitting capacity of passengers did nto and could nto stop at the above bus stop in view of the fact that under the law the crew had no right to take any passengers under those circumstances that since another bus was standing at the same bus stop the bus manned by respondents Nos and slowed down its speed and when it was swerving towards right to overtake the standing bus suddenly the deceased tried to board the running bus at a great risk and peril that in his attempt to do so hi boarding the moving bus the major portion of his body was hanging outside the bus when it was dashed against the stationary bus as a result of which he fell down and received shock that it was thus due to the contributory negligence of the deceased that he was involved in the accident in question that there was no rashness or negligence on the part of the respondents Nos and that the allegations in the application regarding the age of the deceased his state of health and income and the relationship of the applicants to the deceased should all be proved by the applicants and that the applicants were nto entitled to get anything as compensation and the petition should be dismissed with costs The applicants filed a replication in which they pointed out that at the time of the issue of the notification mentioned in the preliminary objections the provisions under which the application was made were nto incorporated in the Act and were enacted subsequently that the prior notification could not therefore exempt the vehicle of <ORG> from the provisions enacted subsequently that the saving clause in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act had no application at all and that no notices under Section of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure were necessary They also reiterated the allegations and contentions in their application and stated that the version given by the respondents was false and concocted that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased that under the circumstances the respondents and had the last opportunity of avoiding the accident by a reasonable care and the plea of the alleged contributory negligence was nto at all open to the respondents and that the applicants were entitled to the compensation as claimed by them Whether the death of <NAME> was due to an accident caused by the rash driving and negligence of the driver and conductor respectively of Bus No Dlp on at about at Farash Khana Grover in A No of reported in nd Punj wherein it was held that <ORG> of the respondents were nto exempted from the provisions of Chapter Viii of <ORG> Act and an application for compensation lay against them before <ORG> The only questions which were argued before us were those raised under issues and namely Whether the death of <NAME> was due to an accident caused by the rash driving and negligence of the driver and the conductor respectively of Bus No Dlp on at about at Farash Khana Bus Stop Whether the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence and to what amount of compensation the appellants applicants were entitled and from whom The appellants applicants examined eye witnesses to prove that the accident which resulted in the death of <NAME> was due to the rash driving and negligence on the part of the driver and the conductor After narrating the evidence adduced by the parties the Judgment proceeds The <ORG> firstly observed that the statement of the witness that there was no sufficient space for Mm to overtake the bus seemed to be wrong and that the <ORG> was nto prepared to believe the said statement of the witness and opined that if at all he reached there after the accident and he did nto himself actually see the facts leading to the accident It failed to note that the evidence of <NAME> regarding the occurrence of the accident was corroborated in material particulars by the evidence of A and A The next question for consideration is as to whether the accident was caused by the rash driving and negligence of the driver and the conductor respectively of the offending bus We consider that there is considerable force in the two contentions of <NAME> On a consideration of the evidence we are of the opinion that it has been established by the appellants applicants that the accident was caused by the rash driving and negligence of the driver and the conductor of the offending bus No Dlp We referred to the decision only to point out that another learned Judge had taken the same view as we have taken namely that the act of the conductor in signalling the bus to proceed before the passenger standing on the foot board moved into the bus and the act of the driver in nto allowing sufficient clearance while passing by the side of the stationary bus are acts of rashness and negligence on the part of the conductor and the driver The preamble to the Fatal Accidents Act shows that the said Act was enacted in as it was considered at that time that no action for suit was maintainable in any court against a person who by his wrongful act neglect or default may have caused the death of another person and because it was right and expedient that the wrong doer in such a case should be answerable in damages for the injury so caused by him It is thus a general law providing for compensation to the representatives of a deceased person or to his estate for the loss occasioned by his death as a result of an accident On the other hand the Motor Vehicles Act is a special law which by Sections to provides for adjudication upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles Section A provides that an application for compensation arising out of an accident of the nature specified in Section may be made by the person who has sustained the injury or where death has resulted from the accident by the legal representatives of the deceased or by an agent duly authorised by the person injured or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be and also prescribes the Period within which such an application may be made Section contains provisions regarding the procedure and the powers of the Claims <ORG> Section provides a right of appeal to <ORG> to a person aggrieved by the award Section provides for the recovery of money due from an insurer under an award as arrear of land revenue Section bars the jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain any question relating to any claim for compensation which may be adjudicated upon by a Claims <ORG> The Act purports to consolidate and amend the law relating to motor vehicles Therefore it is idle to suggest that the <ORG> has gone wrong in nto determining the claim on the principle enunciated by their Lordships of <ORG> in <ORG> case Award of <ORG> On receipt of an application for compensation made under Section A <ORG> shall after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard hold an enquiry into the claim and may make award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid and in making the award <ORG> shall specify the amount which shall be paid by the insurer On the other hand in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act provision is made that The Court may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought and under Section of the said Act provision is made that the administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default There are various decisions in which courts had to deal with claims under the Fatal Accidents Act and interpret the above mentioned words in the Sections A and of the Fatal Accidents Act The word just has a wider ambit than the words used in Sections A and of the Fatal Accidents Act <ORG> may in deciding the just compensation in a case bear in mind and apply any general principle or principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian or English decisions as far as they may be applicable and in so far as they may promote the interests of justice on the facts and the circumstances of each case In other words the said principles laid down in the decisions under the Fatal Accidents Act may be used or applied if they in the opinion of the <ORG> would serve as a proper measure of what is just compensation on the facts and circumstances of the case in hand As already stated there are two distinct kinds of damages or compensation i two distinct heads recoverable under the Fatal Accidents Act The first is the compensation proportionate to the loss resulting from death to the beneficiaries named in Section A while the second provided for in Section of the Act is the compensation for the loss resulting to the estate of the deceased nto from his death or as a consequence of his death but resulting from the wrongful act neglect or default and as a consequence of such act or default Decisions under the Fatal Accidents Act have interpreted the loss in both the cases as pecuniary loss In the present case there is no claim for compensation of the second category or head and it is therefore nto necessary to consider the same <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondents also maintained that this principle has to be applied in the present case per month that the said income was nto reduced and the appellants were nto deprived of the said income after the death of Shri <NAME> and they did nto suffer any pecuniary loss because of the death of <NAME> as the share of <NAME> was allotted to his wife <NAME> after the death of <NAME> and <NAME> became the partner of the firm that the deceased had an insurance claim of Rupees to Rs which was received by the family and that therefore in the circumstances the question of awarding any more amount as compensation does nto arise as held by <ORG> It is clear from the principle enunciated by <ORG> which in our opinion should be applied in the present case in determining the just compensation payable to the appellants applicants that the pecuniary loss to the claimants has to be ascertained by balancing the loss to them of the future pecuniary benefit and the pecuniary advantage which came to them by reason of the death In the absence of any evidence adduced by the parties the court can only try to guess what the deceased must have been reasonably spending as there does nto seem to be any other way There is no evidence in the case to show if <NAME> was laying by any portion of his income In the present case there was neither a pleading nor any evidence adduced by the respondents regarding the same There is nothing on the record which shows that <NAME> was given the share in the firm and made a partner for and on behalf of the other appellants also We have therefore to proceed on the basis that <NAME> alone gto the advantage of the share or interest of <NAME> in the firm We therefore consider that no further amount of compensation need be paid to the wife <NAME> As regards the children left by <NAME> the eldest son <NAME> was aged about years and was studying in <ORG> Delhi in Sc Final the second son <NAME> was aged about years and was studying in <ORG> in nd year the daughter <NAME> was aged about years and was studying in <ORG> <NAME> also left behind him his father <NAME> who was aged about years and his mother <NAME> who was aged about years on the date of the application However since the claimants get a lump sum and also because of the uncertainties of life such as the deceased or the claimants might die before the expiry of the normal span of life a deduction of to per cent from out of the amount of pecuniary loss has usually been made in decisions dealing with cases under the Fatal Accidents Act vide <NAME> <NAME> A Mys in the case of each of the parents of <NAME> the amount of compensation payable to each of them would come to Rs However as the cause of action for all the claimants was the same and we are going to make an order which ought to have been made by the Claims <ORG> we are of the opinion that in exercise of our power under Order Rule read with Section Code of Civil Procedure we should make an order for compensation in favor of <NAME> also in order to do complete justice between the parties In view of our finding that the accident took place on account of the rashness and negligence on the part of the Driver and the Conductor of the offending bus they respondents and as well as <ORG> and <ORG> respondents and are liable for the payment of the compensation to the claimants Accordingly we allow the appeal set aside the judgment and order of <ORG> dated and order that <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> be paid Rs
