A common question of law has arisen in these cases which has been referred by the revising authority for the opinion of this court The question is Whether on the facts and circumstances of this case the article ceased to be an agricultural produce and whether the tea produced by the assessee would be exigible to sales tax The assessee owns some tea gardens The tea leaves grown in the gardens are sold after being processed and packed The term turnover has been denned in Section i in the following words Turnover means the aggregate amount for which goods are supplied or distributed by way of sale or are sold or the aggregate amount for which goods are bought whichever is greater by a dealer either directly or through another on his account or on account of others whether for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration Provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise or poultry or dairy products from fowls or animals kept by him shall be excluded from his turnover The assessee relies on the proviso its contention being that tea sold by it is agricultural produce grown by itself on land which belongs to it Now there is no dispute that tea leaves are agricultural produce and are grown by the assessee in its own gardens But it is clear that the principle underlying this provision has to be kept in view while deciding as to whether or not a produce is agricultural produce for the purposes of the Sales Tax Act It is not disputed on behalf of the department that some process is necessary to convert tea leaves into tea and such a process will not make any difference Briefly recalling the tea leaves were first of all subjected to weathering in shadow in rooms on a wooden floor for about hours and then they were crushed by hand or foot and were then roasted for about minutes Later they were roasted on mats for about minutes and then covered by wet sheets for generating fermentation The leaves were then subjected to grading with sieves of various sizes Fanning machines are also used in completing the grading process The produce was then finally roasted with charcoal for obtaining suitable flavour and colours So long as the nature of the produce remains unaltered it does not make any difference if the processing is long and complicated However there is no finding by <ORG> or by the revising authority that there is a market for such loose tea in the State of Uttar Pradesh We accordingly answer the question in the negative in favour of the assessee and against the department The assessee would be entitled to the costs which we assess at Rs
