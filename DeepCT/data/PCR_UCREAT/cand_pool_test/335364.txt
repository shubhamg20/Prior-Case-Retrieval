The question referred to <ORG> for decision is whether under Section of the Civil Procedure Code a suit to remove a trustee will lie Mr Justice <NAME> and MR Justice <NAME> expressed doubts whether Section empowered a <ORG> to remove a trustee whilst in <NAME> Krishna I Mad It appears to me that Section of the Civil Procedure Code was drafted on the lines of George III Is it probable therefore that if the <ORG> intended the section to apply to a case where the removal of a trustee was in question that specific relief would not have been mentioned We are however asked to add words to the section and to say that the <ORG> intended to give the power to remove adversely a trustee although the <ORG> refrained from saying so The words granting such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require cannot under the recognized rules of construction be said to give a <ORG> the power to remove a trustee The words of a statute cannot be construed contrary to their meaning as embracing or excluding cases merely because no good reason appears why they should be excluded or embraced see <NAME> <NAME> Eden The question is whether under the provision of Section of the Civil Procedure Code two or more persons can with the consent of the Advocate General institute a suit for the removal of a trustee on the ground of fraudulent and improper conduct The contention therefore that the section was intended to comprehend suits having that end in view can only be rested on the ground that by necessary implication jurisdiction to entertain such suits was conferred by the section Apart from this section there is no doubt that in the Presidency Town it was competent to the Advocate General to initiate proceedings either for the purpose of removing a trustee or for the purposes mentioned in the section including that of having a scheme of management settled by the <ORG> as was done in the <NAME> case The powers of the Advocate General in this respect to take action for the protection of charitable trusts are the same as those which the Attorney General in England possesses Attorney General <NAME> I A At any rate no ca can be found in which a <NAME> <ORG> has exercised such jurisdiction This being the state of things while no alteration of the law was required for the Presidency Town for <ORG> with regard to charities in the mufussil there was need that jurisdiction should be given to enable those <ORG>s to deal more effectually with trust property Whether the <ORG> had any further purpose in view and intended that District <ORG>s should grant relief generally with regard to such trusts in suits instituted by a public official or by interested persons with his consent is the question we have to determine In favour of the construction of the section giving the <ORG> this larger jurisdiction it may fairly be said that the case such as the present in which the removal of the trustee is alleged to be required in the interests of the trust is eminently one in which it might be thought that a power to invoke the aid of the <ORG> should be given either to a public official or to persons interested in the trust Legislation to that effect with reference to charities not of a religious character would be hi harmony with the enactment already in force with regard to trusts of a religious character for under the Act of it is competent to persons interested in a religious establishment on leave of the District <ORG> being first obtained but without joining as plaintiff any of the other persons interested to bring a suit against the trustee who has been guilty of breach of trust and to obtain his removal from office or other relief The remedy is not wanting altogether but except in this section of the Code there is no provision of law empowering any public official to take action It appears to me that no construction of the section is altogether free from difficulties Again it would seem strange that the <ORG> should think it necessary to restrict to <ORG> and <ORG> the jurisdiction in such simple matters as appointing new trustees for although there may be a prayer for the settlement of a scheme the jurisdiction is complete notwithstanding that there is no such prayer Again seeing that for the Presidency Towns no amendment of the law was required it is difficult to understand why the Advocate General was mentioned and why an alternative jurisdiction was given to <ORG> It might lead to the most inconvenient results if a suit could be instituted under the section in <ORG> and at the same time another suit under the old procedure in a District Munsif Court In this country there was the Act of relating to religious endowments and containing the section already mentioned which gives a general jurisdiction to <ORG> in the case of any breach of trust If in it was intended to give <ORG> a similar jurisdiction in suits launched by persons interested in non religious trusts and in the section as originally framed the words or religious do not appear it is difficult to understand why all mention of this important head of relief the removal of trustees was not mentioned The statute is entitled An Act to provide a summary remedy in cases of abuses of trusts created for charitable purposes and it enables two or more persons to proceed by petition praying such relief as the nature of the case might require In my opinion a jurisdiction to remove trustees as it is not given expressly by the chapter is not given by necessary implication and therefore the question referred to us must be answered in the negative
