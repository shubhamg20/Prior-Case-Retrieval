Section authorises <ORG> to make or cause to be made a full and complete investigation into the circumstances of the case if <ORG> is of the opinion that a in respect of any scheduled industry or industrial undertaking or undertakings i there has been or is likely to be a substantial fall in the volume of production for which having regard to the economic conditions prevailing there is no justification or ii there has been or is likely to be a marked deterioration in the quality of any article which could have been or can be avoided or iii there has been or is likely to be a rise in the price of any article for which there is no justification or iv it is necessary to take any such action for the purpose of conserving any resources of national importance or any industrial undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest Section empowers <ORG> to cancel the order made under section A if it appears that the purpose of the order has been fulfilled or it is not necessary that the order should remain in force Swadeshi Cotton <ORG> was taken over by <ORG> by a notification dated April in exercise of the powers conferred on it under clause a of sub section of section AA of the Industries Development and Regulation Act on the ground that the company had by creation of encumbrances on the assets of its industrial undertakings brought about a situation which had affected and is likely to further affect the production of articles manufactured or produced by it and that immediate action is necessary to prevent such a situation The <ORG> authorised <ORG> to take over the management subject to the conditions that the authorised person shall comply with all the directions issued from time to time by <ORG> and that the authorised person shall hold office for a period of five years The appellant <ORG> challenged the aforesaid order in a writ petition in <ORG> The case was heard by <ORG> of five Judges to consider the question whether in construing section AA of the Industries Development and Regulation Act compliance with the principle of audi alteram partem is to be implied and whether hearing is to be given to the parties who would be affected by the order to be passed prior to the passing of the order or whether hearing can be given after the order is passed and whether the order passed under the said Section is vitiated by not giving of such hearing and whether such vice can be cured The Bench by a majority answered the three questions as follows a Section AA a excludes the giving of prior hearing to the party who would be affected by order thereunder After the decision on the reference the case was reheard on merits by <ORG> of three Judges and the writ petition was allowed in part Appeals to this <ORG> were filed on behalf of the <ORG> as well as by <ORG> and <ORG> Where the civil consequences of the administrative action are grave and its effect is highly prejudicial to the rights and interests of the person affected and there is nothing in the language and scheme of the statute which unequivocally excludes a fair pre decisional hearing and the post decisional hearing provided therein is not a real remedial hearing equitable to a full right of appeal the <ORG> should be loath to infer a legislative intent to exclude even a minimal fair hearing at the pre decisional stage merely on ground of urgency The evidence on the basis of which the impugned order was passed was not disclosed to the appellant company till May only after it had filed the writ petition in <ORG> If there was anything adverse to the appellants in the survey report there was time enough about six weeks between the submission of the Survey Report and the passing of the impugned order for giving a short reasonable opportunity to the appellants to explain the adverse findings against them For the interregnum suitable interim action such as freezing the assets of the <ORG> or restraining the <ORG> from creating further encumbrances could be taken under section The rule of natural justice to give a hearing has been incorporated in section which gives an opportunity of a post decisional hearing to the owner of the undertaking who if he feels aggrieved can on his application be heard to show that even the original order under section AA was passed on invalid grounds and should be cancelled or rescinded Under section <ORG> exercises curial functions and that Section confers on the aggrieved owner a right to apply to the <ORG> to cancel the order of take over This section casts an obligation on <ORG> to deal with and dispose of an application filed thereunder with reasonable expedition But in view of the commitment concession that a hearing would be afforded to the <ORG> the case is remitted to <ORG> to give a full fair and effective hearing The rules of natural justice can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made If a statutory provision either specifically or by inevitable implication excludes the application of the rules of natural justice then the <ORG> cannot ignore the mandate of the <ORG> Whether or not the application of the principles of natural justice in a given case has been excluded in the exercise of statutory power depends upon the language and basic scheme of the provision conferring the power the nature of the power the purpose for which it is conferred and the effect of that power Difficulties however arise when the statute conferring the power does not expressly exclude this rule but its exclusion is sought by implication due to the presence of certain factors such as urgency where the obligation to give notice and opportunity to be heard would obstruct the taking of prompt action of a preventive or remedial nature Cases where owing to the compulsion of the fact situation or the necessity of taking speedy action no pre decisional hearing is given but the action is followed soon by a full post decisional hearing to the person affected do not in reality constitute an exception to the audi alteram partem rule If the statute conferring the power is silent with regard to the giving of pre decisional hearing to the person affected and the administrative decision taken by the authority involves civil consequences of a grave nature and no full review or appeal on merits against that decision is provided courts will be extremely reluctant to construe such a statute as excluding the duty of affording even a minimal hearing shorn of all its formal trappings and dilatory features at the pre decisional stage unless viewed pragmatically it would paralyse the administrative process or frustrate the need for utmost promptitude A comparison of the provisions of Section A and Section AA bring out two main points of distinction First action under Section A can be taken only after an investigation had been made under Section while under Section AA a or action can be taken without such investigation The language scheme and setting of Section AA read in the light of the Objects and Reasons for enacting this provision make this position clear beyond doubt In contrast with it action under section AA a can be taken only if <ORG> is satisfied with regard to the existence of the twin conditions specifically mentioned therein on the basis of evidence in its possession It cannot be laid down as a general proposition that whenever a statute confers a power on an administrative authority and makes the exercise of that power conditional on the formation of an opinion by that authority in regard to the existence of an immediacy its opinion in regard to that preliminary fact is not open to judicial scrutiny at all The marginal note refers to the power to take over without investigation but there is no sufficient reason to suppose that the word immediate is used only to contra distinguish it from the investigation contemplated by section of the Act though of course a consequence of immediate action under section AA may be to dispense with the enquiry under section In fact facts which come to light during the course of an investigation under section may form the basis of action under section AA a Where in the course of an investigation under section it is discovered that the management have by reckless investments or creation of encumbrances on the assets of the industrial undertaking or by diversion of funds brought about a situation which is likely to affect the production of the articles manufactured or produced in the industrial undertaking if the <ORG> is satisfied that immediate action is necessary to prevent such a situation there is no reason why <ORG> may not straightaway take action under section AA a without waiting for completion of investigation under section Where there is a provision in the statute itself for revocation of the order by the very authority making the decision it appears to be unnecessary to insist upon a pre decisional observance of natural justice <ORG> has taken so serious a view of the matter that it has authorised <ORG> to take over the management of the industrial undertaking if immediate action may prevent jeopardy to production or restore production where it has already stopped Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Ltd Kanpur hereinafter referred to as the said industrial under takings have by creation of encumbrances on the assets of the said industrial undertakings brought about a situation which has affected and is likely to further affect the production of articles manufactured or produced in the said industrial undertakings and that immediate action is necessary to prevent such a situation Now therefore in exercise of power conferred by clause a of sub section of Section AA of the Industries Development and Regulation Act <ORG> hereby authorises <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the Authorised person to take over the management of the whole of the said industrial undertakings subject to the following terms and conditions namely i The authorised person shall comply with all the directions issued from time to time by the Central Government ii the authorised person shall hold office for a period of five years from the date of publication of this order in the Official Gazette iii the Central Government may terminate the appointment of the authorised person earlier if it considers necessary to do so This order shall have effect for a period of five years commencing from the date of its publication in <ORG> On April three petitioners namely the Company through its Joint Secretary <NAME> its Managing Director Dr <NAME> and its subsidiary company named <ORG> through its Directors and Shareholders filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution in <ORG> against <ORG> and <ORG> to challenge the validity of the aforesaid Government Order dated April The writ petition first came up for hearing before <ORG> who by its order dated August requested the Chief Justice to refer it to a larger Bench The case was then heard by a three Judge Bench who by their order dated October requested the Hon ble the Chief Justice to constitute a still larger Bench to consider the question whether a prior hearing is necessary to be given to the persons affected before the order under Section AA is passed If so a whether such hearing is to be given to the parties who would be affected by the order to be passed under the said Section prior to the passing of the order or whether such hearing is to be given after the passing of the order and if prior hearing is to be normally given and the order passed under the said Section is vitiated by not giving of such hearing whether such vice can be cured by the grant of a subsequent hearing answered this three fold question as follows Section AA a excludes the giving of prior hearing to the party who would be affected by order thereunder The petition succeeds in so far as it seeks to protect from the impugned order the corporate entity of the company the corporate entity of the subsidiary and its assets the holding of the company in <ORG> and the assets and property of the company which are not referable to any of the industrial undertakings The respondents would release from its control and custody and or deliver possession of any assets or property of the company which are not referable to the industrial undertakings in terms of the observations made in paras and of the judgment within a period of three months from today May In the peculiar circumstances the parties would bear their respective costs Subsequently on July a similar certificate was granted by <ORG> to <ORG> and <ORG> Consequently the <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> have filed Civil Appeals and of respectively in this Court There were other contentions also which were canvassed by the learned counsel for the parties at considerable length <NAME> contends that there is nothing in the language scheme or object of the provisions in Section AA and or Section which expressly or by inevitable implication excludes the application of the principles of natural justice or the giving a pre decisional hearing adapted to the situation to the owner of the undertaking It only means that under Section AA action can be taken without prior investigation under Section if there is evidence in the possession of the Government that the assets of the Company owning the undertaking are being frittered away by doing any of the three things mentioned in clause a or the undertaking has remained closed for a period of not less than three months and the condition of plant and machinery is such that it is possible to restart the undertaking Section in terms deals with the power of Central <ORG> to cancel an order of take over under two conditions namely First when the purpose of an order under Section A has been fulfilled or second when for any other reason it is not necessary that the order should remain in force Therefore the illusory right given by Section to the aggrieved owner of the undertaking to make an application for cancellation of the order is not a full right of appeal on merits It is only the existence of a full right of appeal on the merits or the existence of a provision which unequivocally confers a power to reconsider cancel and obliterate completely the original order just as in appeal which may be construed to exclude natural justice or a pre decisional hearing in an emergent situation Where the civil consequences of the administrative action as in the instant case are grave and its effect is highly prejudicial to the rights and interests of the person affected and there is nothing in the language and scheme of the statute which unequivocally excludes a fair pre decisional hearing and the post decisional hearing provided therein is not a real remedial hearing equitable to a full right of appeal the <ORG> should be loath to infer a legislative intent to exclude even a minimal fair hearing at the pre decisional stage merely on ground of urgency Applying the proposition propounded by him to the facts of the instant case <NAME> submits that there was ample time at the disposal of the Government to give a reasonably short notice to the Company to present its case In this connection it is pointed out that according to para of the further affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> and other respondents <ORG> had in its possession two documents namely a copy of the Survey Report on It is submitted that this evidence on the basis of which the impugned order was passed was not disclosed to the appellant Company till May only after it had filed the writ petition in the High <ORG> to challenge the impugned order It is emphasised that if the Survey Report was assumed to contain something adverse to the appellants there was time enough about six weeks between the submission of the Survey Report and the passing of the impugned order for giving a short reasonable opportunity to the appellants to explain the adverse findings against them <NAME> submits that this rule of natural justice in a modified form has been incorporated in Section which gives an opportunity of a post decisional hearing to the owner of the undertaking who if he feels aggrieved can on his application be heard to show that even the original order under Section AA was passed on invalid grounds and should be cancelled or rescinded <NAME> further submits that since Section does not specify any period of time within which the aggrieved party can seek the relief thereunder the opportunity of full effective and post decisional hearing has to be given within a reasonable time It is stressed that under Section <ORG> exercises curial functions and that Section confers on the aggrieved owner a right to apply to the <ORG> to cancel the order of take over On a true construction this Section casts an obligation on <ORG> to deal with and dispose of an application filed thereunder with reasonable expedition <NAME> further concedes that on the well settled principle of implied and ancillary powers the right of hearing afforded by Section carries with it the right to have inspection and copies of all the relevant books documents papers etc In India also this was the position before the decision dated February of this <ORG> in Dr <NAME> <NAME> case ibid wherein it was held that even an administrative order or decision in matters involving civil consequences has to be made consistently with the rules of natural justice In <NAME> case the <ORG> also quoted with approval the observations of Lord <NAME> from the <ORG> decision in In re An Infant ibid which were to the effect that good administration and an honest or bona fide decision require not merely impartiality or merely bringing one mind to bear on the problem but acting fairly The rules of natural justice can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made If a statutory provision either specifically or by inevitable implication excludes the application of the rules of natural justice then the <ORG> cannot ignore the mandate of the <ORG> Whether or not the application of the principles of natural justice in a given case has been excluded wholly or in part in the exercise of statutory power depends upon the language and basic scheme of the provision conferring the power the nature of the power the purpose for which it is conferred and the effect of the exercise of that power The next general aspect to be considered is Are there any exceptions to the application of the principles of natural justice particularly the audi alteram partem rule We have already noticed that the statute conferring the power can by express language exclude its application However difficulties arise when the statute conferring the power does not expressly exclude this rule but its exclusion is sought by implication due to the presence of certain factors such as urgency where the obligation to give notice and opportunity to be heard would obstruct the taking of prompt action of a preventive or remedial nature Eventually the Chief Election <ORG>er issued a notification which stated that taking all circumstances into consideration the <ORG> was satisfied that the poll had been vitiated and therefore in exercise of the powers under Article of the Constitution the poll already held was cancelled and a repoll was being ordered in the constituency The Election <ORG> contended that a prior hearing has in fact been given to the appellant In addition on the question of application of the principles of natural justice it was urged by the respondents that the tardy process of notice and hearing would thwart the conducting of elections with speed that unless civil consequences ensued hearing was not necessary and that the right accrues to a candidate only when he is declared elected This contention which had found favour with <ORG> was negatived by this <ORG> Delivering the judgment of the <ORG> <NAME> lucidly explained the meaning and scope of the concept of natural justice and its role in a case where there is a competition between the necessity of taking speedy action and the duty to act fairly It will be useful to extract those illuminating observations in extenso Once we understand the soul of the rule as fairplay in action and it is so we must hold that it extends to both the fields After all administrative power in democratic set up is not allergic to fairness in action and discretionary executive justice cannot degenerate into unilateral injustice Nor is there ground to be frightened of delay in convenience and expense if natural justice gains access The exceptions to the rules of natural justice are a misnomer or rather are but a shorthand form of expressing the idea that in those exclusionary cases nothing unfair can be inferred by not affording an opportunity to present or meet a case After referring to several decisions including the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> the Court explained that mere invocation or existence of urgency does not exclude the duty of giving a fair hearing to the person affected It is untenable heresy in our view to lock law the victim or act behind his back by tempting invocation of urgency unless the clearest case of public injury flowing from the least delay is self evident <NAME> The <ORG> further emphasised the necessity of striking pragmatic balance between competing requirements of acting urgently and fairly thus Should the cardinal principle of hearing as condition for decision making be martyred for the cause of administrative immediacy We think not In circumstances of likely immediate detriment to the public it may be appropriate for the <ORG> to issue a warning off notice without notice or stated grounds but limited to a particular meeting coupled with a notice that the <ORG> proposed to make a long term order on stated grounds and to give an earliest practicable opportunity to the person affected to appear before the <ORG> and show why the proposed long term order be not made The approach may be acceptable where the original decision does not cause serious detriment to the person affected or where there is also a paramount need for prompt action or where it is impracticable to afford antecedent hearings Conversely if the statute conferring the power is silent with regard to the giving of a pre decisional hearing to the person affected and the administrative decision taken by the authority involves civil consequences of a grave nature and no full review or appeal on merits against that decision is provided courts will be extremely reluctant to con strue such a statute as excluding the duty of affording even a minimal hearing shown of all its formal trappings and dilatory features at the pre decisional stage unless viewed pragmatically it would paralyse the administrative process or frustrate the need or utmost promptitude The court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent possible with situational modifications But to recall the words of <NAME> the core of it must however remain namely that the person affected must have reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty public relations exercise Section gives power to <ORG> to cause investigation to be made into a scheduled industry or industrial undertaking The Section reads as follows where the Central Government is of the opinion that a in respect of any scheduled industry or industrial undertaking or undertakings i there has been or is likely to be a substantial fall in the volume of production in respect of any article or class of articles relatable to that industry or manufactured or produced in the industrial undertaking or undertakings as the case may be for which having regard to the economic conditions prevailing there is no justification or ii there has been or is likely to be a marked deterioration in the quality of any article or class of articles relatable to that industry or manufactured or produced in the industrial undertaking or undertakings as the case may be which could have been or can be avoided or iii there has been or is likely to be a rise in the price of any article or class of articles relatable to that industry or manufactured or produced in the industrial undertaking or undertakings as the case may be for which there is no justification or iv it is necessary to take any such action as is provided in this Chapter for the purpose of conserving any resources of national importance which are utilised in the industry or the industrial undertaking or undertakings as the case may be or any industrial undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest Section empowers <ORG> to issue appropriate directions to the industrial undertaking concerned on completion of investigation under Section Section A confers power on <ORG> to assume management or control of an industrial undertaking in certain cases Any notified order issued under sub section shall have effect for such period not exceeding five years as may be specified in the order Section specifies the effect of notified order under Section A Sub section of the section reads thus On the issue of a notified order under Section A authorising the taking over of the management of an industrial undertaking a all persons in charge of the management including persons holding office as managers or directors of the industrial undertaking immediately before the issue of the notified order shall be deemed to have vacated their offices as such any contract of management between the industrial undertaking and any managing agent or any director thereof holding office as such immediately before the issue of the notified order shall be deemed to have been terminated the managing agent if any appointed under Section A shall be deemed to have been duly appointed as the managing agent in pursuance of the Indian Companies Act and the memorandum and articles of association of the industrial undertaking and the provisions of the said Act and of the memorandum and articles shall subject to the other provisions contained in this Act apply accordingly but no such managing agent shall be removed from office except with the previous consent of the Central Government the person or body of persons authorised under Section A to take over the management shall take all such steps as may be necessary to take into his or their custody or control all the property effects and actionable claims to which the industrial undertaking is or appears to be entitled and all the property and effects of the industrial undertaking shall be deemed to be in the custody of the person or as the case may be the body of persons as from the date of the notified order and the persons if any authorised under Section A to take over the management of an industrial undertaking which is a company shall be for all purposes the directors of industrial undertaking duly constituted under the Indian Companies Act and shall alone be entitled to exercise all the powers of the directors of the industrial undertaking whether such powers are derived from the said Act or from the memorandum or articles of association of the industrial undertaking or from any other source Section provides that a person whose office is lost under clause a or whose contract of management is terminated under clause of Section shall have no right to compensation for such loss or termination It reads thus If at any time it appears to <ORG> on the application of the owner of the industrial undertaking or otherwise that the purpose of the order made under Section A has been fulfilled or that for any other reason it is not necessary that the order should remain in force <ORG> may by notified order cancel such order and on the cancellation of any such order the management or the control as the case may be of the industrial undertaking shall vest in the owner of the undertaking In order to ensure that at the end of the period of take over by <ORG> the industrial undertaking is not returned to the same hands which were responsible for its earlier misfortune it has been provided in the Bill that in relation to an undertaking taken over by them <ORG> will have the power to move for i the sale of the undertaking at a reserve price or higher <ORG> purchasing it at the reserve price if no offer at or above the reserve price is received action being taken simultaneously for the winding up of the company owning the industrial undertaking or ii the reconstruction of the company owning the industrial undertaking with a view to giving the <ORG> a controlling interest in it With a view to ensuring speedy action by <ORG> it has been provided in the Bill that if the <ORG> has evidence to the effect that the assets of the company owning the industrial undertaking are being frittered away or the undertaking has been closed for a period not less than three months and such closure is prejudicial to the concerned scheduled industry and that the financial condition of the company owning the industrial undertaking and the condition of the plant and machinery installed in the undertaking is such that it is possible to restart the undertaking and such restarting is in the public interest <ORG> may take over the management without an investigation The marginal heading of the Section is to the effect Power to take over industrial undertakings without investigation under certain circumstances Section AA runs as under Without prejudice to any other provision of this Act if from the documentary or other evidence in its possession <ORG> is satisfied in relation to an industrial undertaking that a the persons incharge of such industrial undertaking have by reckless investments or creation of encumbrances on the assets of the industrial undertaking or by diversion of funds brought about a situation which is likely to affect the production of articles manufactured or produced in the industrial undertaking and that immediate action is necessary to prevent such a situation or it has been closed for a period of not less than three months whether by reason of the voluntary winding up of the company owning the industrial undertaking or for any other reason and such closure is prejudicial to the concerned scheduled industry and that the financial condition of the company owning the industrial undertaking and the condition of the plant and machinery of such undertaking are such that it is possible to re start the undertaking and such re starting is necessary in the interests of the general public it may by a notified order authorise any person hereinafter referred to as the authorised person to take over the management of the whole or any part of the industrial undertaking or to exercise in respect of the whole or any part of the undertaking such functions of control as may be specified in the order The provisions of sub section of Section A shall as far as may be apply to a notified order made under sub section as they apply to a notified order made under sub section of Section A Nothing contained in sub section and sub section shall apply to an industrial undertaking owned by a company which is being wound up by or under the supervision of the <ORG> <NAME> Where any notified order has been made under sub section the person or body of persons having for the time being charge of the management or control of the industrial undertaking whether by or under the orders of any court or any contract instrument or otherwise shall notwithstanding anything contained in such order contract instrument or other arrangement forthwith make over the charge of management or control as the case may be of the industrial undertaking to the authorised person The provisions of Section to bot inclusive shall as far as may be apply to or in relation to the industrial undertaking in respect of which a notified order has been made under sub section as they apply to an industrial undertaking in relation to which a notified order has been issued under Section A A comparison of the provisions of Section A and Section AA a would bring out two main points of distinction First action under Section A can be taken only after an investigation had been made under Section while under Section AA a or action can be taken without such investigation In contrast with it action under Section AA a can be taken only if the Central Gov <ORG> is satisfied with regard to the existence of the twin conditions specifically mentioned therein on the basis of evidence in its possession The general principle of law is that an order affecting his liberty or property cannot be made against any one without giving him an opportunity of being heard the result is that if general words used in a statute empowering the making of such an order as this it must be made on notice to the party affected There are however exceptions to this rule which arise where it can be seen on the words of the statute that it was intended that the order should be made on an ex parte application and the case in which it is easiest to see the propriety of the exception is where looking at the scope and object of the legislation it was clearly intended that the parties putting the law in force should act promptly According to the learned Solicitor General the power conferred on <ORG> is in the nature of an emergency power that the necessity for taking immediate action is writ large in Section AA a the provision being a legislative response to deal with an economically emergent situation fraught with national repercussions On the other hand <NAME> submits that <ORG> was clearly in error in holding that the satisfaction of <ORG> with regard to the necessity of taking immediate action was not open to judicial review at all It is emphasised that the very language of the provision shows that the necessity for taking immediate action is a question of fact which should be apparent from the relevant evidence in the possession of the <ORG> We find merit in this contention It cannot be laid down as a general proposition that whenever a statute confers a power on an administrative authority and makes the exercise of that power conditional on the formation of an opinion by that authority in regard to the existence of an immediacy its opinion in regard to that preliminary fact is not open to judicial scrutiny at all Section AA a in terms requires that the satisfaction of the <ORG> in regard to the existence of the circumstances or conditions precedent set out above including the necessity of taking immediate action must be based on evidence in the possession of the <ORG> If the satisfaction of the <ORG> in regard to the existence of any of the conditions i and ii is based on no evidence or on irrelevant evidence or on an extraneous consideration it will vitiate the order of take over and the <ORG> will be justified in quashing such an illegal order on judicial review in appropriate proceedings Even where the statute conferring the discretionary power does not in terms regulate or hedge around the formation of the opinion by the statutory authority in regard to the existence of preliminary jurisdictional facts with express checks the authority has to form that opinion reasonably like a reasonable person While spelling out by a construction of Section AA a the proposition that the opinion or satisfaction of the <ORG> in regard to the necessity of taking immediate action could not be the subject of judicial review <ORG> majority relied on the analogy of Section of the Land Acquisition Act under which according to them the <ORG> opinion in regard to the existence of the urgency is not justiciable It is true that the grounds on which the <ORG> opinion as to the existence of the urgency can be challenged are not unlimited and the power conferred on the <ORG> under Section of that Act has been formulated in subjective term nevertheless in cases where an issue is raised that the <ORG> opinion as to urgency has been formed in a manifestly arbitrary or perverse fashion without regard to patent actual and undeniable facts or that such opinion has been arrived at on the basis of irrelevant considerations or no material at all or on materials so tenuous flimsy slender or dubious that no reasonable man could reasonably reach that conclusion the <ORG> is entitled to examine the validity of the formation of that opinion by the <ORG> in the context and to the extent of that issue this <ORG> held that while exercising the power under Section of the Land Acquisition Act the mind of the officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section A of the Act which has to be considered this Court held that where the purported order does not recite the satisfaction of the Government with regard to the existence of urgency nor the fact of the land being waste or arable land the order was liable to be struck down and the mere direction therein to the Collector to take action on ground of urgency was not a legal and complete fulfilment of the requirement of the law Save in real urgency where public interest does not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not having regard to Articles and burke an enquiry under Section of the Act Firstly as rightly pointed out by <NAME> the expression immediate action in the said phrase is to be construed in the light of the marginal heading of the Section its context and the Objects and Reason for enacting this provision Indeed <NAME> strongly relies on this decision in support of his argument that if the application of this rule of natural justice at the pre decisional stage is not excluded even where a full investigation has been made there is stronger reason to hold that it is to be observed in a case where there has been no investigation at all After completing the inquiry <ORG> submitted its report to the Government who thereafter on November passed the impugned order under Section A authorising the <ORG> to take over the management of the <ORG> for a period of five years This contention was pressed on behalf of the <ORG> in spite of the fact that an opportunity had been given by <ORG> to the management and the employees of the <ORG> for adducing evidence and for making representation before the completion of the investigation On the contentions raised by the <ORG> and resisted by the respondent in that case the Court formulated the following questions Is it necessary to observe the rules of natural justice before enforcing a decision under Section A of the Act What are the rules of natural justice in such a case a In the present case have the rules to be observed once during the investigation under Section and then again after the investigation is completed and action on the report of <ORG> taken under Section A Was it necessary to furnish a copy of <ORG> before passing an order of take over <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> answered these questions thus The first of these questions does not present any difficulty Even so the question of natural justice does arise in this case The only essential point that has to be kept in mind in all cases is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case and that the administrative authority concerned should act fairly impartially and reasonably a For answering that question we shall keep in mind and examine the nature and scope of the inquiry that had been carried out by <ORG> set up by the <ORG> the scope and purpose of the Act and rules under which <ORG> was supposed to act the matter that was being investigated by the Committee and finally the opportunity that was afforded to the appellants for presenting their case before <ORG> After noticing the object purpose and content of the relevant provisions the judgment proceeded In fact it appears from a letter addressed by appellant No <NAME> on behalf of the Company to Shri <NAME> Deputy Secretary <ORG> on th September that the appellants had come to know that <ORG> was in fact considering the question of appointing an authorised controller under Section A of the Act in respect of the appellants undertaking There is also an account of the efforts made by the Company Directors to restore the mill There is no attempt to minimise the financial difficulties of the Company in that letter The letter specifically mentions the company application to <ORG> for financial help the <ORG> ultimately failed to come to the succour of the Company In a letter of September <ORG> informed <ORG> in clear language that if the Company failed to obtain the necessary guarantee by September <ORG> was proceeding to take action under the Act emphasis added All these circumstances leave in no manner of doubt that the Company had full opportunities to make all possible representations before the <ORG> against the proposed take over of its mill under Section A There are at least five features of the case which make it impossible for us to give any weight to the appellants complaint that the rules of natural justice have not been observed First on their own showing they were perfectly aware of the grounds on which <ORG> had passed the order under Section A of the Act Secondly they are not in a position to deny a that the Company has sustained such heavy losses that its mill had to be closed down indefinitely and that there was not only loss of production of textiles but at least persons had been thrown out of employment Fourthly the appellants were given a full hearing at the time of the investigation held by <ORG> and were also given opportunities to adduce evidence Finally even after <ORG> had submitted its report the appellants were in constant communion with the <ORG> and were in fact negotiating with <ORG> for such help as might enable them to reopen the mill and to avoid a take over of their undertaking by the <ORG> Having regard to these features it is impossible for us to accept the contention that the appellants did not get any reasonable opportunity to make out a case against the take over of their undertaking or that the <ORG> has not treated the appellants fairly There is not the slightest justification in this case for the complaint that there has been any denial of natural justice In our opinion since the appellants have received a fair treatment and also all reasonable opportunities to make out their own case before <ORG> they cannot be allowed to make any grievance of the fact that they were not given a formal notice calling upon them to show cause why their undertaking should not be taken over or that they had not been furnished with a copy of the report They had made all the representations that they could possibly have made against the proposed take over emphasis added In our opinion it is not possible to lay down any general principle on the question as to whether the report of an investigating body or an inspector appointed by an administrative authority should be made available to the persons concerned in any given case before the authority takes a decision upon that report We have no doubt that in the instant case non disclosure of the report of <ORG> has not caused any prejudice whatsoever to the appellants emphasis added It will be seen from what has been extracted above that in Keshav <ORG>s case this Court did not lay it down as an invariable rule that where a full investigation after notice to the owner of the industrial undertaking has been held under Section the owner is never entitled on grounds of natural justice to a copy of the investigation report and to an opportunity of making a representation about the action that the <ORG> proposes to take on the basis of that report On the contrary it was clearly said that this rule of natural justice will apply at that stage in cases where unless the report is given the party concerned cannot make any effective representation about the action that <ORG> takes or proposes to take on the basis of that report In the facts of that case it was found that the non disclosure of the investigation report had not caused any prejudice whatever because the Company were aware all along that as a result of the report of <ORG> the Company undertaking was going to be taken over by <ORG> and had full opportunities to make all possible representations before the <ORG> against the proposed take over of the <ORG> <NAME> submitted that the observations made by this <ORG> in <ORG> case to the effect that in certain cases even at the post investigation stage before making an order of take over under Section A it may be necessary to give another opportunity to the affected owner of the undertaking to make a representation appear to be erroneous The argument is that the <ORG> has provided in Sections and A of the Act and Rule framed thereunder its measure of this principle of natural justice and the stage at which it has to be observed There is nothing in those observations which can be said to be inconsistent with the ratio decidendi of <ORG> case The High <ORG> came to the conclusion that on a correct construction of Section A it was necessary before any order could be made thereunder that the investigation should have been initiated on the basis of the opinion mentioned in Section of the Act On appeal by special leave this Court reversed the decision of <ORG> and held that the words used by the <ORG> in Section A in respect of which an investigation has been made under Section could not be cut down by the restricting phrase based on an opinion that the industrial undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest that Section A empowers <ORG> to authorise a person to take over the management of an industrial undertaking if the one condition of an investigation made under Section had been fulfilled irrespective of on what opinion that investigation was initiated and the further condition is fulfilled that <ORG> was of opinion that such undertaking was being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest In this Court it was urged on behalf of the Company that absurd results would follow if the words investigation has been made under Section are held to include investigation based on any of the opinions mentioned in Section a It was negatived because in the facts and circumstances of that case the Company was fully aware that the quality of the management was also being inquired into and it had full opportunity to meet the allegations against it during investigation Thus in the ultimate analysis the question as to what extent and in what measure this rule of fair hearing will apply at the pre decisional stage will depend upon the degree of urgency if any evident from the facts and circumstances of the particular case As regards the other five units of the <ORG> the question whether on the basis of the evidential matter before the <ORG> at the time of making the impugned order any reasonable person could reasonably form an opinion about a likelihood of fall in production and the urgency of taking immediate action will be discussed later For the purpose of the question under consideration we shall assume that there was a likelihood of fall in production There was thus sufficient time available to the <ORG> to serve a copy of that report on the appellant <ORG> and to give them a short measure opportunity to submit their reply and representation regarding the findings and recommendations of the Group Officers and the proposed action under Section AA The third reason for our forbearance to imply the exclusion of the audi alteram partem rule from the language of Section AA a is that although the power thereunder is of a drastic nature and the consequences of a take over are far reaching and its effect on the rights and interests of the owner of the undertaking is grave and deprivatory yet the Act does not make any provision giving a full right of a remedial hearing equitable to a full right of appeal at the post decisional stage <ORG> seems to be of the view that Section gives a right of full post decisional remedial hearing to the aggrieved party In the alternative the learned counsel has committed himself on behalf of his client to the position that <ORG> will if required give the <ORG> a full and fair hearing on merits including an opportunity to show that the impugned order was not made on adequate or valid grounds The power of cancellation under Section can be exercised only on any of these grounds i that the purpose of the order made under Section A has been fulfilled or ii that for any other reason it is not necessary that the order should remain in force But their ambit has been greatly cut down and circumscribed by the contextual phrase no longer necessary that it should remain in force Before we conclude the discussion on this point we may notice one more argument that has been advanced on behalf of the respondents It is argued that this was a case where a prior hearing to the <ORG> could only be a useless formality because the impugned action has been taken on the basis of evidence consisting of the Balance sheet account books and other records of the <ORG> itself the correctness of which could not have been disputed by the <ORG> Given an opportunity the Company might have explained that as a result of this indebtedness there was no likelihood of fall in production which is one of the essential conditions in regard to which the Government must be satisfied before taking action under Section a This contention was rejected by <ORG> for the reason that if <ORG> had given the police officer a prior hearing they would not have acted wrongly or unreasonably if they had in the exercise of their discretion decided to take a more lenient course than the one they had adopted In <NAME> <ORG> <ORG> expressed in the same strain that doing what is right may still result in unfairness if it is done in the wrong way Observance of this fundamental principle is necessary if the courts and the tribunals and the administrative bodies are to command public confidence in the settlement of disputes or in taking quasi judicial or administrative decisions affecting civil rights or legitimate interests of the citizens The rationale of the majority view is that where there is a duty to act fairly just like the duty to act reasonably it has to be enforced as an implied statutory requirement so that failure to observe it means that the administrative act or decision was outside the statutory power unjustified by law and therefore ultra vires and void In India this Court has consistently taken the view that a quasi judicial or administrative decision rendered in violation of the audi alteram partem rule wherever it can be read as an implied requirement of the law is null and void The learned Solicitor has assured the <ORG> that such a hearing will be afforded to the appellant Company if it approaches <ORG> for cancellation of the impugned order In view of this commitment or concession fairly made by the learned Solicitor General we refrain from quashing the impugned order and allowing Civil Appeal of send the case back to <ORG> with the direction that it shall within a reasonable time preferably within three months from today give a full fair and effective hearing to the aggrieved owner of the undertaking i the <ORG> on all aspects of the matter including those touching the validity and or correctness of the impugned order and or action of take over and then after a review of all the relevant materials and circumstances including those obtaining on the date of the impugned order shall take such fresh decision and or such remedial action as may be necessary just proper and in accordance with law The first of the submissions of <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant company was that there was a violation of the principles of natural justice He submitted that the provisions of the Industries Development and Regulation Act did not rule out natural justice and that there were several occasions in the march of events that led to the passing of the order under Sec AA when an opportunity could have been given to the Company and the principles of natural justice observed but <ORG> refrained from doing so He drew inspiration for this argument from the marginal note to Section AA which is power to take over industrial undertakings without investigation under certain circumstances There was no reason to belittle the scope of Sec Both the learned counsel invited our attention to considerable case law Before I consider the submissions of the learned counsel as to the applicability of the principles of natural justice a few prefatory remarks however require to be made if the statute so provides or if the <ORG> so deem fit in appropriate cases a postponed hearing may be substituted for natural justice The Industries Development and Regulation Act was enacted pursuant to the power given to <ORG> by Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution provides that words and expressions not defined in the Act but defined in the Companies Act shall have the meaning assigned to them in that Act authorises the Central <ORG> to make or cause to be made a full and complete investigation into the circumstances of the case if the Central <ORG> is of the opinion that a in respect of any scheduled industry or industrial undertaking or undertakings i there has been or is likely to be a substantial fall in the volume of production for which having regard to the economic conditions prevailing there is no justification or ii there has been or is likely to be a marked deterioration in the quality of any article for which there is no justification or iv it is necessary to take any such action for the purpose of conserving any resources of national importance or any industrial undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest provides if <ORG> is satisfied that such action is desirable it may issue appropriate directions for a regulating the production of any article and fixing the standards of production requiring the industrial undertaking to take such steps as the Central Government may consider necessary to stimulate the development of the industry prohibiting resort to any act or practice which might reduce the undertaking production capacity or economic value controlling the prices or regulating the distribution of any article AA refers to Power to take over industrial undertakings without investigation under certain circumstances It enables <ORG> by a notified order to authorise any person or body of persons to take over the management of the whole or any part of an industrial undertaking or to exercise in respect of whole or any part of the undertaking such functions of control as may be specified in the order if without prejudice to any other provisions of the Act from the documentary or other evidence in its possession <ORG> is satisfied in relation to the industrial undertaking that a the persons incharge of such industrial undertakings have by reckless investments or creation of encumbrances on the assets of the industrial undertaking or by diversion of funds brought about a situation which is likely to affect the production of articles manufactured or produced in the industrial under taking and that immediate action is necessary to prevent such a situation or it has been closed for a period of not less than three months whether by reason of the voluntary winding up of the company owning the industrial undertaking or for any other reason and such closure is prejudicial to the concerned scheduled industry and that the financial condition of the company owning the industrial undertaking and the condition of the plant and machinery of such undertaking are such that it is possible to re start the undertaking and such re starting is necessary in the interests of the general public A if it appears to <ORG> that the purpose of the order has been fulfilled or that for any other reason it is not necessary that the order should remain in force The development and regulation of certain key industries was apparently considered so basic and vital to the economy of our country that <ORG> in its wisdom thought fit to enact the Industries Development Regulation Act after making the declaration required by Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the industries specified in the schedule to the Act as earlier mentioned by us Apart from making provision for the establishment of <ORG> and other <ORG> and the licensing of scheduled industries the Act empowers <ORG> to cause a full and complete investigation to be made where there is a substantial fall in the volume of production for which there is no justification having regard to the prevailing economic conditions or there is marked deterioration in the quality of the goods produced or the price of the goods produced is rising unjustifiably or where conservation of resources of national importance is necessary or the industrial undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry or to public interest Sec Whether there is an investigation or not <ORG> may also take over the management of the industry under Sec Where there is an apprehension that production is likely to be affected as a result of the wilfull acts of the management or where the production has already come to a stand still because of the closure of the undertaking for a period of not less than three months <ORG> is authorised to intervene to restore production There was some argument at the <ORG> that the expression immediate action was not to be found in Sec It is true that the marginal note refers to the power to take over without investigation but there is no sufficient reason to suppose that the word immediate is used only to contra distinguish it from the investigation contemplated by Sec In fact facts which come to light during the course of an investigation under Sec it is discovered that the management have by reckless investments or creation of encumbrances on the assets of the industrial undertaking or by diversion of funds brought about a situation which is likely to affect the production of the articles manufactured or produced in the industrial undertaking if the <ORG> is satisfied that immediate action is necessary to prevent such a situation there is no reason why <ORG> may not straight away take action under Sec <ORG> apparently contemplated a situation where immediate action was necessary and having contemplated such a situation there is no reason to assume that <ORG> did not contemplate situations which brooked not a moments delay According to him the scope and extent of the opportunity to be given to the party against whom action is taken may depend upon the situation but nothing would justify a negation of a natural justice AA give a notice to the person incharge to show cause why the order under Sec Such a procedure may be possible practicable and desirable in situations where there is no statutory provision enabling the decision making authority to review or reconsider its decision Where there is a provision in the statute itself for revocation of the order by the very authority making the decision it appears to us to be unnecessary to insist upon a pre decisional observance of natural justice <ORG> has taken so serious a view of the matter that it has authorised <ORG> to take over the management of the industrial undertaking if immediate action may prevent jeopardy to production or restore production where it has already stopped It was submitted by the learned counsel that Sec could be said to impliedly exclude natural justice there is then no reason not to hold that Sec In view of the order proposed by my learned brothers <NAME> and <NAME>
