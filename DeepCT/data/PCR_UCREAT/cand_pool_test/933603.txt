The plaintiff brought this suit for the recovery of possession of a turn of worship in a certain temple for eight days in the month from the th to the th by virtue of a usufructuary mortgage from the mother and guardian of defendants Nos and on the allegation that he had been dispossessed of the same by the manager of the defendant No the Raja of Puri who is supporting the claim of defendant No The <ORG> of first instance decreed the suit for recovery of possess <NAME> but the learned Subordinate Judge has dismissed the same It is contended in second appeal that the learned Subordinate Judge is wrong Section of the Transfer of Property Act which is applicable to mortgages of immovable property only has therefore no application Then again the document in question was executed in three years before the Transfer of Property Act came into force and under Section Clause the Act had no application There is no other law which required that a document like the one in question should have been attested by witnesses The plaintiff claims as the mortgagee of a shebak and not as a shebak if he had possession as such mortgagee that would be quite sufficient to make out a primd facie title as such mortgagee it was held that the plaintiff who had acted as shebait for years had acquired a complete title against the defendants who had not sued to oust him within six years under Article of the second Schedule to the Limitation Act Then the learned Subordinate Judge says It does not lie in the mouth of the defendant No to set up the right and possession of No defendant father <NAME> since the <NAME> predecessor admitted plaintiff possession by Exhibit and in the next sentence Exhibit does not show that plaintiff possession or his over right was ever admitted since it distinctly mentioned that plaintiff was in possession on behalf of defendants Nos and The plaintiff is himself one of the recognised shebaks on other days and if in the case of such a shebak on the acquisition of an additional turn of worship the ceremony of shariti be at all necessary it is difficult to see how after undisputed possession for years and express recognition by or on behalf of defendant No the question can be raised in the present case The judgment of the learned Subordinate Judge is a curious combination of bad Law and worse reasoning and we have no hesitation in setting aside the same As the judgment is full of contradictions it is difficult to make out what has been found for and what found against the plaintiff Costs to abide the result
