<NAME> appeal by special leave came up for hearing before a Bench of this <ORG> consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> The only question for consideration in the appeal was whether the facts found by the courts below would be special reasons for awarding the death sentence as required under Section of the CrPC <NAME> appearing as amicus curiae on behalf of the appellant <NAME> in Criminal Appeal No SCR the courts below were not competent to impose the extreme penalty of death on the appellant It was submitted that neither the circumstance that the appellant was previously convicted for murder and committed these murders after he had served out the life sentence in the earlier case nor the fact that these three murders were extremely heinous and inhuman constitutes a special reason for imposing the death sentence within the meaning of Section of the CrPC Reliance for this argument was placed on <NAME> ibid which according to the counsel was on facts very similar if not identical to that case According to <NAME> the challenge to the award of the death sentence as violative of Articles and was repelled by <ORG> in <NAME> case ii In <NAME> case <ORG> held The impossibility of laying down standard in the matter of sentencing is at the very core of criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment and that this discretion in the matter of sentence is liable to be corrected by superior courts The exercise of judicial discretion on well recognised principles is in the final analysis the safest possible safeguard for the accused This view again according to <NAME> is inconsistent with the law laid down by <ORG> in Jagmohan wherein it was held that deprivation of life is constitutionally permissible if that is done according to procedure established by law If without the restriction of stating sufficient reasons death sentence could be constitutionally awarded under the I and Criminal as it stood before the amendment it is difficult to perceive how by requiring special reasons to be given the amended section would be unconstitutional unless the sentencing sector is made restrictive and least vagarious Without expressing his own opinion on the various questions raised in that case including the one With regard to the scope amplification and application of Section of the CrPC <NAME> in agreement with <NAME> directed the records of the case to be submitted to the Hon ble the Chief Justice for constituting a large Bench to resolve the doubts difficulties and inconsistencies pointed out by <NAME> That is how the matter has now come up before this larger Bench of five Judges Thirdly it is submitted that India has since acceded to the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights adopted by <ORG> which came into force on December The learned Solicitor General <NAME> opposed the request of <NAME> for referring the matter to a larger Bench because such a course would only mean avoidable delay in disposal of the matter We have heard the arguments of <NAME> appearing for the writ petitioners in Writ Petition No for more than three weeks and also those of Dr <NAME> Dr <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> appearing for intervenes or for the other writ petitioners We have also heard the arguments of <NAME> Solicitor General appearing for <ORG> and <NAME> appearing for the State of Maharashtra and the other counsel appearing for the respondents The principal questions that fall to be considered in this case are i Whether death penalty provided for the offence of murder in Section Penal Code is unconstitutional Regarding death as a punishment the authors of the Code say We are convinced that it ought to be very sparingly inflicted and we propose to employ it only in cases where either murder or the highest offence against the <ORG> has been committed In the instant cases the impugned provision of the Indian Penal Code is Section which says Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and also be liable to fine The related provisions are contained in Sections and Its material part runs as follows Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death of Secondly If it is done with me intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death of the person to whom the harm is caused or Thirdly If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or Fourthly If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Nothing in Sub clause a of Clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence Nothing in Sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause Nothing in Sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause Nothing fan Sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe Nothing in Sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect me operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the State from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or sex vice whether to the exclusion complete on partial of citizens or otherwise Broadly speaking Article is intended to protect the rights to the freedoms specifically enumerated in the six Sub clauses of Clause against <ORG> action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regulate these rights in the public interest relating to heads specified in Clauses to The six fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article are not absolute rights to these rights have been expressly made subject to the power of the <ORG> to impose reasonable restrictions which may even extend to prohibition on the exercise of those rights The conferment of this power is founded on the fundamental truth mat uncontrolled liberty entirely freed from restraint degenerates into a license leading to anarchy and chaos that libertine pursuit of liberty absolutely free and free for all may mean liberticide for all It is important to note that whereas Article expressly deals with the right to life and personal liberty Article does not The right to life is not one of the rights mentioned in Article Thus considered can any one say that he has a legal right of fundamental freedom under Article to practise the profession of a hired assassin or to form associations or unions or engage in a conspiracy with the object of committing murders or dacoities The argument that the provisions of the Penal Code prescribing death sentence as an alternative penalty for murder have to be tested on the ground of Article appears to proceed on the fallacy that the freedoms guaranteed by Article are absolute freedoms and they cannot be curtailed by law imposing reasonable restrictions which may amount to total prohibition In that case the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Bombay Lotteries and Prim Competition Control Act as amended by Bombay Act No XXX of was challenged on the ground inter alia that it infringes the fundamental rights of the promoters of such competitions under Article to carry on their trade of business and that the restrictions imposed by the said Act cannot possibly be supported at reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public permissible under Article It was contended that the words trade of business or commerce in Sub clause of Article a should be read in their widest amplitude as any activity which is undertaken or carried on with a view to earning profit since there is nothing in Article which may qualify or cut down the meaning of the critical words that there is no justification for excluding from the meaning of those words activities which may be looked upon with disfavour by the <ORG> or the <ORG> as injurious to public morality or public interest Thus there will be a guaranteed right to carry on a business of hiring out goondas to commit assault or even murder or house breaking or selling obscene pictures or trafficking in women and so on until the law curbs or stops such activities We have no doubt that there are certain activities which can under no circumstance be regarded as trade or business or commerce although the usual forms and instruments are employed therein It was contended on behalf of <NAME> that since the preventive detention order results in the detention of the detenu in a cell his rights specified in Clauses a to and of Article have been infringed Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided ii Judged by the test of direct and indirect effect on the rights referred to in Article the Penal Code is not a law imposing restrictions on these rights The test is that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the sub clauses If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression of his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of Article will arise Article not apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty Article does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty of personal liberty Personal liberty would primarily mean liberty of the physical body The rights given under Article do not directly come under that description Page In my opinion therefore Article should be read as a separate complete Article In tune with <NAME> the learned Judge observed A construction which would bring within Article imprisonment in punishment of a crime committed or in prevention of a crime threatened would as it seems to me make a reductio ad absurdum of that provision If imprisonment were to be regarded as a restriction of the right mentioned in Article it would equally be a restriction on the rights mentioned by the other Sub clauses of Clause with the result that all penal laws providing for imprisonment as a mode of punishment would have to run the gauntlet of Cls For instance the law which imprisons for theft would on that view fall to be justified under Clause as a law sanctioning restriction of freedom of speech and expression Page Article confers the rights therein specified only on the citizen of India while Article extends the protection of life and personal liberty to all persons citizens and non citizens alike Thus the two Articles do not operate in a conterminous field Personal liberty was used in Article as a sense which excludes the freedoms dealt in Article In his judgment an examination of the provisions of Article clearly suggests that the intention was to make it self contained as regards the law of preventive detention and that the validity of a law on the subject to preventive detention cannot be examined or controlled either by the provisions of Article or by the provisions of Article <NAME> explained the relative scope of the Articles in this group thus To me it seems that Article of the Constitution gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in the various clauses the restraints that may be placed upon them by law so that they may not conflict with public welfare or general morality On the other hand Articles and are primarily concerned with penal enactments or other laws under which personal safety or liberty of persons could be taken away in the interests of the society and they set down the limits within which the <ORG> control should be exercised In my opinion the group of Articles to embody the entire protection guaranteed by the Constitution in relation to deprivation of life and personal liberty both with regard to substantive as Well as to procedural law The only proper way of avoiding these anomalies is to interpret the two provisions Articles and as applying to different subjects <NAME> also rejected the argument that the whole of the Indian Penal Code is a law imposing reasonable restriction on the rights conferred by Article with these observations at page To say that every crime undermines the security of the <ORG> and therefore every section of the Indian Penal Code irrespective of whether it has any reference to speech or expression is a law within the meaning of this clause is wholly unconvincing and betrays only a vain and forlorn attempt to find an explanation for meeting the argument that any conviction by a Court of law must necessarily infringe Article a There can be no getting away from the fact that a detention as a result of a conviction impairs the freedom of speech far beyond what is permissible under Clause of Article Likewise a detention on lawful conviction impairs each of the other personal rights mentioned in Sub clauses to The argument that every section of the Indian Penal Code irrespective of whether it has any reference to any of the rights referred to in Sub clauses to and is a law imposing reasonable restriction on those several rights has not even the merit of plausibility There can be no doubt that a detention as a result of lawful conviction must necessarily impair the fundamental personal rights guaranteed by Article far beyond what is permissible under Clauses to of that article and yet nobody can think of questioning the validity of the detention or of the section of the Indian Penal Code under which the sentence was passed ii <NAME> then gave an additional reason as to why validity of punitive detention or of the sections of the Penal Code under which the sentence was passed cannot be challenged on the ground of Article thus Because the freedom of his person having been lawfully taken away the convict ceases to be entitled to exercise any of the rights protected by Clause of Article iii The learned Judge also held that Article protects some of the important attributes of personal liberty as independent rights and the expression personal liberty has been used in Article as a compendious term including within its meaning all the varieties of rights which go to make op the personal liberties of men The case of a person who is convicted of an offence will come under Articles and and also under Article so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned Preventive detention which is dealt with in Article also amounts to be privation of personal liberty which is referred to in Article <NAME> held that since preventive detention unlike punitive detention directly infringes the right under Article it must pass the test of Clause According to the learned Judge only those laws are required to be tested on the anvil of Article which directly restrict any of the rights guaranteed in Article Applying this test of direct and indirect effect to the provisions of the Indian Penal Code the learned Judge pointed out mat the Code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely Its primary object is to punish crime and not to restrict movement The punishment may consist in imprisonment OF a pecuniary penalty If it consists in a pecuniary penalty it obviously involves no restriction on movement but if it consists in imprisonment mere is a restriction on movement This restraint is imposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining crime and making it punishable The punishment is correlated with the violation of some other person right and not with the right of movement possessed by the offender himself In my opinion therefore the Indian Penal Code does not come within the ambit of the words law imposing restriction on the right to move freely A person is punitively detained only after trial for committing a crime and after his guilt has been established in a competent court of justice A person so convicted can take his case to <ORG> and sometimes bring it to this Court also and he can in the course of the proceedings connected with his trial take all pleas available to him to eluding the plea of want of jurisdiction of the Court of trial and the invalidity of the law under which he has been prosecuted The final judgment in the criminal trial will thus constitute a serious obstacle in his way if he chooses to assert even after his conviction that his right under Article has been violated But a person who is preventively detained has not to face such an obstacle whatever other obstacle may be in his way We have copiously extracted from the judgments in <NAME> case to show that all the propositions propounded arguments and reasons employed or approaches adopted by the learned Judges in that case in reaching the conclusion that the Indian Penal Code particularly those of its provisions which do not have a direct impact on the rights conferred by Article is not a law imposing restrictions on those rights have not been overruled or rendered bad by the subsequent pronouncements of this Court in Bank Nationalization case or in <NAME> case that the Indian Penal Code particularly those of its provisions which cannot be justified on the ground of reasonableness with reference to any of the specified heads such as public order in Clauses and is not a law imposing restrictions on any of the rights conferred by Article still holds the field Indeed the reasoning explicit or implicit in the judgments of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> that such a construction which treats every section of the Indian Penal Code as a law imposing restriction on the rights in Article will lead to absurdity is unassailable There are several offences under the Penal Code such as theft cheating ordinary assault which do not violate or affect public order but only law and order It may be noted that genera public interest is not specified as a head in Clauses to on which restriction on the rights mentioned in Clause of the Article may be justified Suppose a person is convicted of an offence of cheating and prosecuted and imprisoned after trial it is not open to say that the imprisonment should be tested with reference to Article for its reasonableness The last sentence which has been underlined by us appears to lend implicit approval to the rule of construction adopted by the majority of the learned Judge in <NAME> case whereby they excluded from the purview of Article certain provisions of the Indian Penal Code providing punishment for certain offences which could not be tested on the specific grounds embodied in Clauses to of that Article This proposition enunciated in <NAME> case is only a product of the application of the basic canon that a construction which would lead to absurdity should be eschewed it is the effect of the law and of the action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to grant relief The question is whether <NAME> and <NAME> have given a complete go by to the test of direct and indirect effect sometimes described as form and object test or pith and substance rule which was adopted by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case In the first place there is nothing much in the name It was contended by the learned Attorney General in that case that since the impugned legislation was not a direct legislation on the subject of freedom of speech and expression Article a would have no application the test being not the effect or result of legislation but its subject matter emphasis added The learned Judge further observed that the impugned Act could be legitimately characterised as a measure which affects the press but its intention or the proximate effect and operation was not such as would take away or abridge the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed in Article a therefore it could not be held invalid on that ground held that the direct and immediate effect of the impugned Order would be to restrain a newspaper from publishing any number of pages for carrying its news and views which it has a fundamental right under Article a and therefore the Order was violative of the right of the newspapers guaranteed by Article a and as such invalid an order prohibiting the publication of the evidence of a witness in a defamation case passed by a learned Judge <NAME> of <ORG> was impugned on the ground that it violated the petitioners right to free speech and expression guaranteed by Article a Whether the findings of fact recorded by the Judge are right or wrong and whether the conclusion of law drawn by him suffers from any infirmity can be considered and decided if the party aggrieved by the decision of the Judge takes the matter up before the appellate Court But it is singularly inappropriate to assume that a judicial decision pronounced by a Judge of competent jurisdiction in or in relation to matter brought before him for adjudication can affect the fundamental rights of the citizens under Article If the test of direct effect and object which is sometimes described as the pith and substance test is thus applied in considering the validity of legislation at would not be inappropriate to apply the same test to judicial decisions like the one with which we are concerned in the present proceedings Indeed there is no dispute that the test of pith and substance of the subject matter and of direct and of incidental effect of legislation is a very useful test to determine the question of legislative competence i in ascertaining whether an Act falls under one Entry while incidentally encroaching upon another Entry For instance if the subject matter of the legislation directly covers any of the fundamental freedoms mentioned in Article it must pass the test of reasonableness under the relevant head in Clauses to of that Article It will have to be ascertained further whether by its direct and immediate operation the impugned legislation abridges any of the rights enumerated in Article From a survey of the cases noticed above a comprehensive test which can be formulated may be restated as under Does the impugned law in its pith and substance whatever may be its form and object deal with any of the fundamental rights conferred by Article If it does does it abridge or abrogate any of those rights And even if it does not in its pith and substance deal with any of the fundamental rights conferred by Article is the direct and inevitable effect of the impugned law such as to abridge or abrogate any of those rights The mere fact that impugned law incidentally remotely or collaterally has the effect of abridging or abrogating those rights will not satisfy the test If the answer to the above queries be in the affirmative the impugned law in order to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness under Article Now let us apply this test to the provisions of the Penal Code in question Section prescribes death or imprisonment for life as penalty for murder We cannot of course say that the object of penal laws is generally such as not to involve any viola Bon of the rights conferred by Article because after the decision of this Court in he Bank Nationalisation case the theory that the object and form of the State action alone determine the extent of protection that may be claimed by an individual and that the effect of the State action on the fundamental right of the individual is irrelevant stands discredited But the point of the matter is that in pith and substance penal laws do not deal with the subject matter of rights enshrined in Article its provision defining the offence will directly and inevitably impinge upon the right guaranteed under clause a of Article Therefore to be valid it must pass the test of reasonableness embodied in Clause of the Article A contrary trend however is discernible in the recent decisions of this Court which start with the initial presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the statute and throw the burden of rebutting that presumption oh the party who challenges its constitutionality on the ground of Article SCR Propositions and that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles and that it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds It was emphasised that Judges act not by hunch but on hard facts properly brought on record and sufficiently strong to rebuff the initial presumption of constitutionality of legislation it was recalled Some courts have gone to the extent of holding that there is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and a law will not be declared unconstitutional unless the case is so clear as to be free from doubt and to doubt the constitutionality of a law is to resolve it in favour of its validity Behind the view that there is a presumption of constitutionality of a statute and the onus to rebut the same lies on those who challenge the legislation is the rationale of judicial restraint a recognition of the limits of judicial review a respect for the boundaries of legislative and judicial functions and the judicial responsibility to guard the trespass from one side or the other In that context the nature of the burden which rests on those who attack the constitutionality of the statute was explained by <NAME> thus We may not require the legislature to select the least severe penalty possible so long as the penalty selected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved Even where the burden is on the <ORG> to show that the restriction imposed by the impugned statute is reasonable and in public interest the extent and the manner of discharge of the burden necessarily depends on the subject matter of the legislation the nature of the inquiry and the scope and limits of Judicial review There is no convincing evidence to show that death penalty serves any penological purpose i Its deterrent effect remains unproven It is proposed to deal with these arguments as far as possible in their serial order In the first place we will notice a few decisions of Courts wherein the deterrent value of death penalty has been judicially recognised He filed a petition for grant of special leave to appeal to this Court under Article of the Constitution It was contended on behalf of <NAME> that the very monstrosity of the crime provided proof of his insanity sufficient to exculpate the offender under Section Indian Penal Code or material for mitigation of the sentence of death In <NAME> also this Court took due note of the fact that for certain types of murders death penalty alone is considered an adequate deterrent A large number of murders is undoubtedly of the common type It was further observed that horrendous features of the crime and the hapless and helpless state of the victim steel the heart of law for the sterner sentence The threat of instant death is the one to which resort has always been made when there was an absolute necessity for producing some result No one goes to certain inevitable death except by compulsion In his book Capital Punishment he has made an attempt to assemble the arguments for and against the death penalty To quote their words There is an additional point worth stressing We have already discussed in detail several aspects of this topic Prima facie the penalty of death is likely to have a stronger effect as a deterrent to normal human beings than any other form of punishment and there is some evidence though no convincing statistical evidence that this is in fact so If there is any element of retribution in the law as administered now it is not the instinct of the man of jungle but rather a refined evolution of that instinct the feeling prevails in the public is a fact of which notice is to be taken <NAME> the Canadian Parliamentarian justifies from another angle the right of the <ORG> to award capital punishment for murder If the <ORG> has the right and the duty to defend the community against outside aggression such as in time of war and within the country for instance in case of treason crimes against the <ORG> etc and that to the extent of taking the life of the aggressors and guilty parties if the citizen wants to protect his own life by killing whoever attacks him without any reason the <ORG> can do the same when a criminal attacks and endangers the life of the community by deciding to eliminate summarily another human being Capital punishment must be retained to prove the sanctity of that most precious thing which is the gift of life it embodies the revulsion and horror that we feel for the greatest of crimes For most people life is priceless and they will do anything and suffer the worst privations to preserve it even when life itself does not bold many consolations or bright prospects for the future As a deterrent the death penalty is playing its part for which there is no substitute I suggest that statistics do not prove much either on one side or the other There are too many variations too many changes as regards circumstances conditions between one period and the other to enable us to make worthy comparisons There is always a danger in adhering too rigidly to concepts We must therefore view the problem against the perspective of the hard realities of the time and the conditions prevailing in the world particularly in our own country Another statement has been furnished showing the number of persons convicted of murder and other capital offences and sentenced to death in some of the States of India during the period to For the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the impugned provision as to death penalty in Section Penal Code on the ground of reasonableness in the light Of Articles and of the Constitution it is not necessary for us to express any categorical opinion one way or the other as to which of these two antithetical views held by the Abolitionists and Retentionists is correct We will now consider the issue whether the impugned limb of the provision in Section Penal Code contravenes Article of the Constitution In <NAME> case which was a decision by a Bench of seven learned Judges it was held by <NAME> in his concurring judgment that the expression personal liberty in Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights under Article it was further observed that Articles and are not to be interpreted in water tight compartments and consequently a law depriving a person of personal liberty and prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the meaning of Article has to stand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article which may be applicable in a given situation exhypothesi it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article The principle of reasonableness pervades all the three Articles with the result that the procedure contemplated by Article must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary fanciful or oppressive otherwise it should be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article would not be satisfied Article reads as under No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law If this Article is expanded in accordance with the interpretative principle indicated in <NAME> it will read as follows No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to fair just and reasonable procedure established by Valid law In the converse positive form the expanded Article will read as below A person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair just and reasonable procedure established by Valid law Thus expanded and read for interpretative purposes Article clearly brings out the implication that the Founding Fathers recognised the right of the <ORG> to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law There are several other indications also in the Constitution which show that the Constitution makers were fully cognizant of the existence of death penalty for murder and certain other offences in the Indian Penal Code Article specifically invests the President with power to suspend remit as commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence and also in all cases where the sentence is a sentence of death Article in terms gives a right of appeal to <ORG> to a person who on appeal is sentenced to death by <ORG> after reversal of his acquittal by the trial Court Under the successive Criminal Procedure Code which have been in force for about years a sentence of death is to be carried out by hanging It is pointed out that India as a member of <ORG> was a participating delegate at the international conference that made the Stockholm Declaration on December that India has also accepted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by <ORG> which came into force on March and to which some countries including India are a party No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life India penal laws including the impugned provisions and their application are thus entirely in accord with its international commitment For all the foregoing reasons we would answer the first main question in the negative This takes us to Question No II Reliance for this argument has been placed on <NAME> case Ibid As against this the learned Solicitor General submits that the policy of the law in the matter of imposition of death sentence is writ large and dear in Section namely that life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception that the correct approach should be to apply this policy to the relevant facts of the particular case bearing on the question of sentence and to find out if there are any exceptional reasons justifying imposition of the death penalty as a departure from the normal rule Before embarking upon a discussion of the arguments advanced on both sides it is necessary to have a peep into the history and legislative background of the procedural provisions relating to sentencing in the CrPC Under the CrPC as it stood before its amendment by Act No of even for the seven offences mentioned earlier which are punishable in the alternative with death the normal sentence was the death sentence and if the <ORG> wanted to depart from this rule it had to give reasons for doing so I made the following comments on this provision a considerable body of opinion is in favour of a provision requiring the <ORG> to state its reasons for imposing the punishment either of death or of imprisonment for life Further this would be good safeguard to ensure that the lower courts examine the case as elaborately from the point of view of sentence as from the point of view of guilt It would increase the confidence of the people in the courts by showing that the discretion is judicially exercised It would also facilitate the task of the High <ORG> in appeal or in proceedings for confirmation in respect of the sentence where the sentence awarded is that of death or in proceedings in revision for enhancement of the sentence where the sentence awarded is one of imprisonment for life In deference to this recommendation Section of the CrPC Amendment Act XXVI of deleted old Sub section of Section with effect from January and thereafter for such capital offences it was left to the <ORG> on the facts of each case to pass in its discretion for reasons to be recorded the sentence of death or the lesser sentence As against this <ORG> of the Madras High <ORG> in <ORG> Mad at held that death was the normal punishment where there were no extenuating circumstances In that case there was a clear finding by <ORG> which had been upheld by <ORG> that each of the two appellants therein committed a cold blooded murder by shooting two inmates of the house simply with the object of facilitating commission of dacoity by them It was held by this Court speaking through <NAME> I that in these circumstances where the murders were committed in cold blood with the sole object of committing dacoity the Sessions Judge had not exercised his discretion judicially in not imposing the death sentence and <ORG> was justified in enhancing the sentence of the appellants from life imprisonment to death Section of the CrPC marks a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the Code of as in force immediately before April according to which both the alternative sentences of death or imprisonment for life provided for murder and for certain other capital offences under the Penal Code were normal sentences <ORG> in its Report stated the object and reason of making this change as follows A sentence of death is the extreme penalty of law and it is but fair that when a <ORG> awards that sentence in a case where the alternative sentence of imprisonment for life is also available it should give special reasons in support of the sentence It requires that If the accused is convicted the Judge shall unless he proceeds in accordance with the provision of Section hear the accused on the question of sentence and then pass sentence on him according to law Sections and of the Code of continue Sections and of the Code of with necessary modifications which bring them in tune with Articles and of the Constitution Section confers on the appropriate <ORG> power to commute sentence without the consent of the person sentenced We may next notice other provisions of the extant Code corresponding to Sections and of the repealed Code bearing on capital punishment Section gives power to <ORG> to direct further inquiry to be made or additional evidence to be taken These provisions seek to ensure mat where in a capital case the life of tide convicted person if at stake the entire evidential material bearing on the innocence as guilt of the accused and the question of sentence must be scrutinised with utmost caution and care by a superior Court <ORG> has been given very wide powers under these provisions to prevent any possible miscarriage of justice Similarly where on appeal <ORG> reverses an acquittal and convicts the accused person and sentences him to death Section of the Code of gives him a right of appeal to <ORG> Finally there is Article of the Constitution under which <ORG> is empowered in its discretion to entertain an appeal on behalf of a person whose sentence of death awarded by the Sessions Judge is confirmed by <ORG> In the light of the above conspectus we will now consider the effect of the aforesaid legislative changes on the authority and efficacy of the propositions laid down by this <ORG> in <NAME> case These propositions may be summed up as under i The general legislative policy that underlies the structure of our criminal law principally contained in the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code is to define an offence with sufficient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment therefor and to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment iii The view taken by the plurality in <NAME> Georgia decided by <ORG> of the United States to the effect that a law which gives uncontrolled and un guided discretion to the Jury or the Judge to choose arbitrarily between a sentence of death and imprisonment for a capital offence violates the Eighth Amendment is not applicable in India We do not have in out Constitution any provision like the Eighth Amendment nor are we at liberty to apply the test of reasonableness with the freedom with which the Judges of <ORG> of America are accustomed to apply the due process clause There are grave doubts about the expediency of transplanting western experience in our country In view of the above it will be impossible to say that there would be at all any discrimination since crime as crime may appear to be superficially the same but the facts and circumstances of a crime are widely different Thus considered the provision in Section Penal Code is not violative of Article of the Constitution on the ground that it confers on the Judges an un guided and uncontrolled discretion in the matter of awarding capital punishment or imprisonment for life When counsel addresses the <ORG> with regard to the character and standing of the accused they are duly considered by the <ORG> unless there is something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public Prosecutor challenges the facts It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to choose either of the two alternative sentences provided in Section Penal Code the <ORG> is principally concerned with the facts and circumstances Whether aggravating or mitigating which are connected with the particular crime under inquiry These provisions are part of the procedure established by law and unless it is shown that they are invalid for any other reasons they must be regarded as valid No reasons are offered to show that they are constitutionally invalid and hence the death sentence imposed after trial in accordance with the procedure established by law is not tin constitutional under Article This postulate has now been modified by Section which mandates the <ORG> convicting a person for an offence punishable with death or in the alternative with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years not to ins pose the sentence of death on that person unless there are special reasons to be recorded for such sentence It would thus be noticed that awarding of the sentence other than the sentence of death is the general rule now and only special reasons that is to say special facts and circumstances in a given case will warrant the passing of the death sentence Now Section provides for a bifurcated trial and specifically gives the accused person a right of pre sentence hearing at which stage he can bring on record material or evidence which may not be strictly relevant to or connected with the particular crime under inquiry but nevertheless have consistently with the policy underlined in Section a bearing on the choice of sentence The present legislative policy discernible from Section read with Section is that in fixing the degree of punishment or making the choice of sentence for various offences including one under Section Penal Code the <ORG> should not confine its consideration principally or merely to the circumstances connected with particular crime but also give due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal The court can depart from that rule and impose the sentence of death only if there are special reasons for doing so Such reasons must be recorded in writing before imposing the death sentence While considering the question of sentence to be imposed for the offence of murder under Section Penal Code the court must have regard to every relevant circumstance relating to the crime as well as the criminal <ORG> could not but be aware that since the Amending Act of death penalty has been imposed by courts on an extremely small percentage of persons convicted of murder a fact which demonstrates that courts have generally exercised their discretion in inflicting this extreme penalty with great circumspection caution and restraint If by laying down standards it is meant that murder should be categorised beforehand according to the degree of its culpability and all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances should be exhaustively and rigidly enumerated so as to exclude all free play of discretion the argument merits rejection Firstly there is little agreement among penologists and jurists as to what information about the crime and criminal is relevant and what is not relevant for fixing the dose of punishment for person convicted of a particular offence Even within a single category offence there are Infinite unpredictable and unforeseeable variations Indeed there Is a real danger of such mechanical standardisation degenerating into a bed of Procrustean cruelty When Judges acting individually or collectively in their benign anxiety to do what they think is morally good for the people take upon themselves the responsibility of setting down social norms of conduct there is every danger despite their effort to make a rational guess of the notions of right and wrong prevailing in the community at large and despite their intention to abide by the dictates of mere reason that they might write their own peculiar view or personal predilection into the law sincerely mistaking that changeling for what they perceive to be the Community ethic In this sensitive highly controversial area of death penalty with all its complexity vast implications and manifold ramifications even all the Judges sitting cloistered in this Court and acting unanimously cannot assume the role which properly belongs to the chosen representatives of the people in <ORG> particularly when Judges have no divining rod to divine accurately the will of the people There Is no risk involved in entrusting a wide discretion to <ORG> and <ORG> in granting anticipatory bail because firstly these are higher courts manned by experienced persons secondly their orders are not final but are open to appellate or revisional scrutiny and above all because discretion has always to be exercised by courts judicially and not according to whim caprice or fancy On the other hand there is a risk in foreclosing categories of cases in which anticipatory bail may be allowed because life throws up unforeseen possibilities and offers new challenges <NAME> said in <NAME> <NAME> AC I desire in the first instance to point out that the discretion given by the section is very wide Now it seems to me that when the Act is so express to provide a wide discretion it is not advisable to lay down any rigid rules for guiding that discretion The offence of murder rape armed robbery or kidnapping was committed by a person with a prior record of conviction for a capital felony or the offence of murder was committed by a person who has a substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions The offence of murder rape armed robbery or kidnapping was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony or aggravated battery or the offense of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of burglary or arson in the first degree The offence of murder was committed by a person in or who has escaped from the lawful confinement It also provides for an automatic appeal of death sentence to <ORG> which may or may not affirm the death sentence The constitutional validity of the amended statutory scheme of Georgia was challenged before <ORG> on the ground that the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of murder under the Georgia statute violated the prohibition against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments Before <ORG> the constitutional validity of the imposition of death penalty for the crime of murder under the Florida statutes was challenged on the same ground as in <NAME> Georgia This was if we may say so with respect an admission of the fact that a considerable range of sentencing discretion has perforce to be left with the sentencing body to be exercised by it according to its own good sense and reason and that no standards howsoever meticulously drafted can totally exclude scope for arbitrary and capricious action It was observed As a general proposition these concerns expressed in Furman are best met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information But this language need not be construed in this way and there is no reason to assume that <ORG> will adopt such an open ended construction This takes us to the question of indicating the broad criteria which should guide the <ORG> in the matter of sentencing a person convicted of murder under Section Penal Code The only effect is that the application of those principles is now to be guided by the paramount beacons of legislative policy discernible from Sections and namely The extreme penalty can be inflicted only in gravest cases of extreme culpability In making choice of the sentence in addition to the circumstances of the offence due regard must be paid to the circumstances of the offender also We will first notice some of the aggravating circumstances which The same principle was substantially reiterated by <NAME> speaking for the Bench in Ediga Anamma in these terms The weapons used and the manner of their use the horrendous features of the crime and hapless helpless state of the victim and the like steel the heart of the law for a sterner sentence It may be noted that this indicator for imposing the death sentence was crystallised in that case after paying due regard to the shift in legislative policy embodied in Section of the CrPC although on the date of that decision February this provision had not come into force What is the relative weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case the murder is of a member of any of the armed forces of the Union or of a member of any police force or of any public servant and was committed i while such member or public servant was on duty or ii in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such member or public servant in the lawful discharge of his duty as such member or public servant whether at the time of murder he was such member or public servant as the case may be or had ceased to be such member or public servant or if the murder is of a person who had acted in the lawful discharge of his duty under Section of the CrPC or who had rendered assistance to a Magistrate or a police officer demanding his aid or requiring his assistance under Section and Section of the said Code But this much can be said that in order to qualify for inclusion in the category of aggravating circumstances which may form the basis of special reasons in Section circumstance found on the facts of a particular case must evidence aggravation of an abnormal or special degree Dr <NAME> has suggested these mitigating factors Mitigating circumstances In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases the <ORG> shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance It the accused is young or old he shall not be sentenced to death The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated The <ORG> shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions and above That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect unpaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct In several States of India there are in force special enactments according to which a child that is a person who at the date of murder was less than years of age cannot be tried convicted and sentenced to death or imprisonment for life for murder nor dealt with according to the same criminal procedure as an adult But those decisions can no longer be held to be good law in view of the current penological trends and the sentencing policy outlined in Sections and There are numerous other circumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence as there are countervailing circumstances of aggravation We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality For all the foregoing reasons we reject the challenge to the constitutionality of the impugned provisions contained in Sections Penal Code and of the CrPC I have had the advantage of reading the careful judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> I am of the view that Section of the Indian Penal Code in so far as it provides for imposition of death penalty as an alternative to life sentence is ultra vires and void as being violative of Articles and of the Constitution since it does not provide any legislative guidelines as to when life should be permitted to be extinguished by imposition of death sentence I would therefore strike down Section as unconstitutional and void in so far as it provides for imposition of death penalty as an alternative to imprisonment for life I shall give my reasons for this view on the day on which the <ORG> reopens after the summer vacation The Writ Petitions and other connected matters may now be placed for hearing in the usual course before <ORG> for consideration of the individual cases on merits in the light of the principles enunciated in the majority judgment
