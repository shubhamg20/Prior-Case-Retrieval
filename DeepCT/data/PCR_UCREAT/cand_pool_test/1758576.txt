The question we are asked to answer is When an Income tax Officer takes action under Section of the Income tax Act for the purpose of raising the rate of tax on the ground that the rate originally fixed was too low is not the Income tax Section refers to income escaping assessment and it provides that in such cases it may either be that the income has escaped assessment or has been assessed at too low a rate the Income tax Officer may serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income profits or gains or in the case of a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included under Sub section of Section and may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains and that the provisions of this Act shall as far as possible apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Then there is a proviso that the tax shall be charged at the rate at which it would have been charged had the income profits or gains not escaped assessment or full assessment as the case may be It is argued for the petitioner that under Section where the rate at which the tax is levied is sought to be raised the Income tax Officer is bound to begin proceedings again as regards assessment and in fact proceed as if there is an inquiry in respect not only of the portion which has escaped assessment but of all the other items also and reference is made to Sections and It is argued that when there are various heads under which a person returns his income if in respect of one of those heads owing to an omission or underestimation he has been taxed at a certain rate which is subsequently found to be incorrect and notice is given to him under Section the Income tax Officer is not to confine himself to that portion which has escaped assessment but he is to begin again as if the notice sent was a first notice sent to the assessee to return his income Section refers to a specific case namely the case where an income chargeable to income tax has escaped assessment or has been assessed at too low a rate When the assessee is given notice to show cause why the tax should not be raised because of an item having escaped assessment he is entitled to show that as a matter of fact there has been no omission and that the original rate is correct
