treated the demand as one under because there was no question of any evasion by the appellant and confined the demand to clearances effected after December appellant contended that The clause excise duty for the time being leviable under the Act on pig iron or steel ingots is attracted only when any pig iron or steel ingot dutiable under the Act is Used in the manufacture of any article dutiable under item AA and as the steel bars used in the manufacture of wire were imported and were not made out of steel ingots dutiable under the Act that loan of the levy was not attracted to the wires and The demand by <ORG> was barred by limitation under excise duty on like articles produced and manufactured The expression the excise duty for the time being leviable by necessary implication refers to an article dutiable under the Act That must necessarily be the article which is one of the components of the article on which duty is sought to be levied that is in the instant case the steel ingot used in the production of wires If the clause in item AA refers to a rate and not to the duty leviable on the material used in the manufacture of the dutiable article then the question would be whether the rate is that at which duty is leviable on steel ingot or that leviable on pig iron the item refers to the material from which the article on which duty is sought to be levied is made the proximate raw material and not the material from which that raw material is made then there is definiteness for the purpose of finding out the amount They were introduced in pursuance of a common purpose namely that the articles listed in item AA whether produced out of indigenous pig iron or steel ingot or made of imported pig iron or steel ingot must bear the same amount of duty to the extent any excise duty or countervailing custom duty has been paid on any of the material used in the manufacture of the article the same is exempt In the present case a common form is prescribed for issuing notices under rr <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgement prepared by <NAME> <NAME> but while I agree with him that there is no force in the plea of limitation advanced on behalf of the assessee in my opinion the appeal should fail on the ground that the excise duty was levied correctly as determined by <ORG> in its order dated November The facts are fully set out in the judgment of <NAME> The short point that arises is this What is the duty leviable on the wires manufactured by the assessee out of steel rods which had already been imported For the time being I will ignore notifications issued under of the rules made under the Excise Act and the amendments made by the Finance Act No It seems to me that the context indicates that the words as the case may be denote that the excise duty leviable on pig iron is to be charged of the product is an iron product if it is a steel product then the excise duty leviable on Although was not enlightened on the point by counsel during the course of the hearing I have no doubt that <ORG> and the trade know how to distinguish a steel product from an iron product If there is a dispute on the point it will have to be resolved in the future But this does not make any difference Not only that it does not exist any longer but duty on it has already been paid and further no duty would be leviable under for it was removed from the factory long time ago in May It seems to me that what it is concerned with is the duty leviable on a hypothetical steel ingot if it had been manufactured or removed at the same time as the steel rods were manufactured or removed It seems to me that this is the true interpretation of column of items AA i I believe I am not stretching the language of the entry against the subject but it appears to me that in the context of scheme of the Excise Act this is the only reasonable construction to give to the entry The effect of this entry is to levy an additional customs duty equivalent to the prevalent excise duty on like articles produced and manufactured It is directed against the order of <ORG> in No of dated November rejecting the appellant application for refund of the excise duty paid by him under protest By Notification No dated April issued in exercise of the powers conferred by rule of the rules framed under the Act to be hereinafter referred to as the rules <ORG> exempted Iron and Steel Products falling under Item AA if made from Pig Iron or Steel Ingots on which the appropriate amount of excise duty has already been paid from so much of the duty of the excise leviable thereon as is equivalent to the duty leviable under Item or as the case may be On December the Government issued yet another Notification under rule amending the Notification No of issued on May The customs duty referred to in sub section i shall be in addition to any duty imposed under this Act or under any other law for the time being in force The appellants paid the same under protest and thereafter took up the matter in appeal to the Collector of <ORG> who dismissed their appeal as per his order of March with these observations The crucial point of this appeal is whether counter vailing import duty was paid by the appellants on the imported steel rods from which steel wires were manufactured The questions that arise for decision in this appeal are What is the true scope of entry No AA of the First Schedule to the Act In considering the scope of the said entry can the Notifications issued by the Government on or after April be taken into consideration Is the demand barred by limitation under rule of the rules One other question had been raised in the grounds of appeal namely that the order of <ORG> is vitiated as it had contravened the principles of natural justice I shall now proceed to consider the questions earlier formulated for decision The contention for the <ORG> is that the expression the excise duty for the time being leviable on Pig Iron or Steel Ingot as the case may be sets out only a measure the rate at which the duty is leviable it has no reference to any particular material it is merely a yardstick If he comes to the conclusion that it is a steel product then he should assess the duty payable firstly by determining the ad valorem duty payable on it thereafter he must find out its weight in metric tons and add to the ad valorem duty the amount payable as excise duty under entry of the First Schedule on steel ingot of that weight It was urged on behalf of the <ORG> that to accept the contention of the assessee and to hold that the second part of the No such difficulty arises if we accept the interpretation placed by the assessee on that clause About a century ago Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> observed As I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation it is tiffs If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be On the other hand if the <ORG> seeking to recover the tax cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law the subject is There is yet another difficulty in accepting the interpretation tried to be placed by the <ORG> on entry AA a rate and not the duty leviable on the material used in the manufacture of the dutiable article under that entry then the question arises whether the rate in question is that at which duty is leviable on steel ingot or that leviable on pig iron to the material from which the article on which duty is sought to be levied is made the proximate raw material and not the material from which that raw material is made then there is no difficulty in finding out the amount It is not his case that there is any recognised basis for doing so It is also not his case that there is any prescribed procedure for deciding that question It is proper to assume from the surrounding circumstances that these two entries were introduced in pursuance of a common purpose that purpose being that the articles listed in entry AA whether produced out of indigenous Pig Iron or Steel Ingot or made out of imported Pig Iron or Steel Ingot must bear the same amount of duty It was conceded by the learned Counsel for the <ORG> that the duty levied under entry of the First Schedule of the Tariff Act is only a countervailing duty It may be that the legislature intended it to be so or there is a lacuna in the provision I now come to the question whether in interpreting a taxing entry I can take any aid from the various steps taken by the <ORG> in implementing that levy I have earlier referred to a large number of Notifications issued under rule of the rules So far as the instructions issued by the <ORG> are concerned there is hardly any doubt that the same are wholly irrelevant At pages of that report it is observed He learned Counsel for the assessee however drew our attention to the directions contained in the Income tax Manual in force for a number of years and contended that the department itself placed on sub sections and of section the same construction as was placed on them by the senior Judge in <ORG> and that was the true construction of these two sub sections The interpretation placed by the department on these sub sections cannot be considered to be a proper guide in a matter like this when the construction of a statute is involved This takes me to the Notifications issued by the Government under rule of the rules All such rules and notifications shall thereupon have effect as if enacted in the Act They are notifications issued under rule of the rules at page it is observed Where a statute provides that subordinate legislation made under it is to have effect as if enacted in the statute such legislation may be referred to for the purpose of construing a provision in the statute itself statute cannot alter or vary the meaning of the statute itself where it is unambiguous and it is doubtful whether such legislation can be referred to for the purpose of construing an expression in the statute even if the meaning of the expression is ambiguous No decision of this <ORG> or of any of the High <ORG>s in this country dealing with tiffs aspect has been brought to my notice That question came up for consideration as early as in in Ex Parte Wier In re Wier and if the question had depended upon the Act alone we should have had great doubt what the proper construction was but we are of opinion that where the construction of the Act is ambiguous and doubtful on any point recourse may be had to the rules which have been made by the Lord Chancellor under the authority of the Act and if we find that in the rules any particular construction has been put on the Act that it is our duty to adopt and follow that construction In Re <ORG> Lord Esher Observed It was urged that we ought to hold the Act to be retrospective by reason of the rules and forms which have been made under it and which have a statutory force and it is said that shew that that the trustee must go back in his accounts to matters which happened before the Act came into operation But when we look at the forms we see that they are in express terms headed so as to relate to transactions taking place after the coming into operation of the Act and therefore they supply no reason why we should depart from the ordinary rule that an Act is not retrospective From these observations it is clear that Lord <NAME> did take into consideration the subordinate legislation in considering the principal Act He took the view that these regulations could not affect the construction of the Act Lord Normand one of the other Judges who heard the appeal observed The National Insurance Industrial Injuries Prescribed Diseases Regulations were made under This is what observed I agree with your Lordships in thinking that the regulations themselves National Insurance industrial Injuries Prescribed Diseases Regulations cannot alter the meaning of the words of the statute but they may I think be looked at as being an interpretation placed by the appropriate <ORG> department on the words of the statute Lastly we come to the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> From the above decisions it is clear that several judges in England have referred to the subordinate legislation made under a statute for the purpose of interpreting that statute though for the limited purpose of know how the department which was entrusted with the task of implementing that statute had understood that statute For finding out the true scheme of a taxing measure we have to take into consideration not merely the levy but also Ch This is what this Court stated therein This notification having been made in accordance with the power conferred by the statute has statutory force and validity and therefore the exemption is as if it is contained in the parent Act itself If that is so the exemption granted under those notifications provide a clue as to the scope of the levy made under Item AA We have earlier seen that on the very day the levy came into force the Government had issued two notifications i Notifications Nos and of These Notifications clearly indicate that under Item AA there was no intention to levy double excise duty on the same material Notifications Nos and exempted payment of excise duty on an article to the extent duty had been paid on the raw material used in the manufacture of the article dutiable under entry AA any excise duty or countervailing custom duty had been paid on any of the material used in the manufacture of any of that article the same is exempt At one Stage it was contended on behalf of the assessee that the levy under sub item of Item AA comes into effect only when an article is made directly from out of Pig Iron or Steel Ingot as the case may be and not otherwise It is not necessary to examine the correctness of this contention because at no stage the assessee had challenged his liability to pay ad valorem duty I shall now take up the question of limitation Hence there is no question of any There is no dispute that the officer who made the demand was competent to make demands both under rule as well as under rule
