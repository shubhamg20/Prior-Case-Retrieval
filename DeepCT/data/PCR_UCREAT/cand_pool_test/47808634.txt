In both the appellants filed two separate but identical writ petitions being No and of challenging the reservation and allotment of of sal seeds in favour of <ORG> which was also selected under Industrial Policy Thereafter the writ petitions were again filed by both the appellants challenging the renewal of lease in favour of the respondents <ORG> and <ORG> by treating such renewals as new leases and also challenging the determination of royalty to be paid for the sal seeds to be supplied to the respondents Such writ petitions have also been dismissed by <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh <ORG> and the present appeals are directed against the decision of <ORG> passed in the said writ petitions Mr <NAME> has further contended that there is no earthly reason to be completely oblivious of the needs of other industrial units operating in the State which also require sal seeds for their units The need of old units was recognised by <ORG> when it directed <ORG> to allot MT to both the appellants by interim order dated Unfortunately such agreements were cancelled by <ORG> on a finding that there was no justification for any concessions to the old units In the new agreements of there is also clause for renewal Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant <ORG> has supported Mr <NAME> in his submissions Mr <NAME> has contended that by the impugned agreements <ORG> has given largesse to the said respondents without inviting any tender and excluding the appellant from obtaining any allotment of sal seeds from the government even though the appellant badly requires sal seeds for its productive activity and it had set up extraction plant long back after examining economic viability with reference to availability of sal seeds in the State of Madhya Pradesh as assured by <ORG> The contention of the appellant that no sal seeds would be left for allotment to the other existing plants was repelled on the ground that the estimated production of sal seeds in the <ORG> was to the tune of one lac according to the report of the committee on <ORG> Mr <NAME> has contended that the executive action in in entering into fresh agreements after being fully aware of the supply position of sal seeds in favour of the respondents with a further renewal clause is patently unjust and has resulted in monopoly without any just cause and reasonable basis Mr <NAME> has contended that the appellant and other existing units in the <ORG> have a right to be considered fairly and reasonably for the distribution of sal seeds by the <ORG> Government in a reasonable and unbiased manner Dr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent <ORG> has disputed the contentions of the appellants Dr <NAME> has contended that there is a fundamental difference between the two categories of industries operating in the State of Madhya Pradesh using sal seeds for production i those which have a specific agreement with the State of Madhya Pradesh entered into under the mandate of the specific policy inviting new entrepreneurs to the State and execution of special agreement with them after selection as opposed to the second category which consists of together units existing prior to the policy not selected by the government of Madhya Pradesh and having no privity of agreement or contract with the State of Such specific dual classification of users of sal seed for productive activity has been repeatedly recognised and judicially upheld as valid in a number of decisions rendered between the same parties Dr <NAME> has also contended that since such agreements in question in the present case were also the subject matter of challenge in the earlier proceedings and fell for scrutiny and adjudication by the <ORG> in the earlier proceedings which ultimately upheld the entire contract including the renewal clauses there is no occasion for the appellants to challenge the said contract and the renewal clauses collaterally In support of such contention reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court in Smt The legitimate expectations of the respondents as persons having agreement with specific renewal clauses which constitute both a representation and established past practice by the State of cannot be denied or thwarted unless overwhelming and specific higher public interest is shown to override those legitimate expectations Dr <NAME> has submitted that the renewal clause in the instant case confers a contrac tual administrative power coupled with a duty upon the authority con cerned whose exercise must necessarily be fair reasonable and non arbitrary Dr <NAME> has contended that the appellants are making attempts to mislead this <ORG> by suggesting and arguing as if the weighted average price formula is a magical formula which is different in nature or content from the market price There is no substance in such contention The weighted average formula is a known method and modality of arriving at and determining the market price itself A dispute was raised on the question of validity of such termination of the agreement and the matter was referred to arbitration initially before a retired Judge of this Court and later on to the District Judge Dr <NAME> has therefore submitted that there is no substance in the contention sought to be raised by the appellants and the appeals should therefore be dismissed with exemplary costs It has been held by <ORG> and by this Court in the earlier proceedings that the respondent namely the <ORG> had been rightly treated on a separate footing on the basis of industrial policy of the government and there was nothing illegal in such industrial policy Mr <NAME> has therefore sub mitted that the appeal should be dismissed with cost The learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh has also disputed the contentions made by the learned counsel for the appellants and it has been submitted by the learned counsel for the <ORG> that the industrial policy was framed by the <ORG> Government after taking into consideration the relevant facts and there was no arbitrariness in such policy It has also been contended by the learned counsel for the <ORG> that production of sal seeds varies from year to year The learned counsel for the <ORG> has submitted that even after meeting such obligation some amount of sal seeds will be placed for auction and the appellants can participate in such auction The learned counsel for the <ORG> has therefore submitted that there is no merit in these appeals and the same should be dismissed with costs After giving our careful consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties it appears to us that the industrial policy of which was subsequently revised from time to time cannot be held arbitrary and based on no reason whatsoever but founded on mere ipsi dixit of the <ORG> Government of The executive authority of the <ORG> must be held to be within its competence to frame policy for the administration of the <ORG> There is no material on record from which it can be reasonably found that the same was not informed by any reason whatsoever The special treatment given to Bastar Oil <ORG>ill by assuring supply of <ORG> It may also be noted that the agreement of <ORG> <NA<ORG>E> was terminated by the <ORG> Government for which reference to arbitration was made in terms of the agreement between the parties Initially the dispute was referred to the arbitration of a retired Judge of this Court but since the same could not be completed within the time frame the arbitration was later on referred to a District Judge It has been rightly contended by Dr <NAME> that the respondents legitimately expect that the renewal clause should be given effect to in usual manner and according to past practice unless there is any special reason not to adhere to such practice In the instant case as a policy decision protective measure by entering into agreements with selected industrial units for assured supply of sal seeds at concessional rate has been taken by the government The rate of royalty has also been fixed on some accepted principle of pricing formula as will be indicated hereafter Hence distribution or allotment of sal seed at the determined royalty to the respondents and other units covered by the agreements cannot be assailed It is to be appreciated that in this case distribution by public auction or by open tender may not achieve the purpose of the policy of protective measure by way of supply of sal seeds at concessional rate of royalty to the industrial units covered by the agreements on being selected on valid and objective considerations If there is an objective and rational foundation for the fixation of royalty the <ORG> will not interfere with the exercise of governmental decision by itself undertaking an exercise to find out as to whether better fixation was possible or not The anxiety of the appellants to also get allotments of reasonable quantity of sal seeds from <ORG> can be appreciated but the policy decision of <ORG> and consequential <ORG> action in entering into agreements with the respondents cannot be struck down on the vice of irrationality and arbitrariness It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the <ORG> that <ORG> is not oblivious of such need and also not averse to old industrial units which also use sal seeds for their plants We reasonably expect that the government will be alive to the need of sal seeds by the industrial units operating in the <ORG> of and in future when the policy will be reviewed by <ORG> it will take into consideration the felt need of proper distribution of sal seeds to different classes of industrial units with appropriate pragmatism We therefore find no reason to interfere with the impugned decision of <ORG>
