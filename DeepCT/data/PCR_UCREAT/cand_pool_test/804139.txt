The suit was dismissed for default as the petitioner did not or as he says was unable to appear on the th August On the th October another application was filed by the petitioner under Order Rule for the setting aside of the aforesaid order of dismissal and for restoration of the aforesaid application under Order Rule Civil This application was dismissed by the Subordinate Judge on the th December he having held that such an application did not lie The material portion of his order runs as follows He meaning the petitioner now applies for an order to act aside the order dismissing his application under Order Rule for default which when contested partake of the nature of suits and not miscellaneous cases of this description The contention of the petitioner is that by virtue of the provision contained in Section Civil Order is applicable to all miscellaneous proceedings including a proceeding under Order and when his application under Order Rule far restoration of the suit was dismissed for default under Rule of that order an application lay under Order Rule for setting aside that order of dismissal and for restoration and re hearing of the former application under Order Rule The learned Judges who decided that case relied upon the reason of the Rule in <NAME> <NAME> in which an application for setting aside a sale under Order Rule Civil had been dismissed for default and it was held that Order was applicable for setting aside that order of dismissal The proceeding in initiated by an application which has to be numbered as a separate miscellaneous case and decided upon evidence I think the true meaning of the passage is that in the opinion of the learned Judges a proceeding which originates in a new application which has to be numbered as a separate miscellaneous case and decided upon evidence satisfies the requirements laid down in the decision of <ORG> therefore is in my opinion wrong and after the shock it has received in numerous authoritative decisions of several Courts can no longer be relied upon The Code has made no express provision for case like this and it is natural to suppose that there should be some way open to the petitioner to get rid of the order which was passed on the th September if he can show that his default was not due to his laches To meet cases such as this Section of the Code was enacted and where there is no provision in the Code expressly providing for a remedy and none which prohibits a remedy being administered and such remedy is called for in order to do that real and substantial justice for the administration of which it exists the provision of Section may and should be resorted to The Rule therefore will be made absolute in these terms but in view of the facts of the case no order will be made as to the costs in the Rule
