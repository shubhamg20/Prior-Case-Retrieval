A which was executed by the first defendant on th September comprised properties which it appears from several statements on record stood in the first defendant name but as the title deeds themselves have not been produced it is not possible to make a mere positive statement on the point In their dealings with outsiders the family seem to have found it convenient whether it be for bookkeeping purposes or for other purposes as well to keep two sets of accounts one for <ORG> and another for <ORG> though there was some amount of mixture even in respect of the transactions relating to one shop and the other It is also stated that he was related to the family and presumably he was well acquainted with its position and affairs It is clear that between and the date of the suit no member of the family ever questioned either the binding character of this debt or the binding character of the mortgage on the other hand we have the fact that in a partition suit instituted by the third defendant against the other members of the family in the properties comprised by the suit mortgage were not brought into the partition suit at all by any of the parties thereto nor was any suggestion made that this mortgage was not binding on the family It is true that the mere fact of the sale having been held subject to the mortgage would not preclude purchasers from questioning the truth or the validity of the mortgage If the plaintiff was related to the family of the mortgagor defendants and had known their affairs there was nothing particular for him to enquire about The real question therefore is whether there is sufficient proof on record as to the existence of the debt the payment of which was secured by this mortgage Assuming for the sake of argument that all the members of the mortgagor family are sympathising with the plaintiff there is nothing whatever to show that the Official Receiver if he had been summoned on the defendant side would not have produced the accounts of the business or would not have given useful information bearing on the question of the truth of the debt and he would have been in the best position to explain why neither he nor any of the other creditors in the insolvency of the fourth defendant thought fit to impeach the suit mortgage but on the other hand to sell the properties subject to the suit mortgage In these circumstances we have no hesitation in concurring in the finding of the lower Court that Ex On a view of the law which seems to vis untenable the learned Subordinate Judge held against the plaintiff on this point Lastly it was contended that as the first defendant was only a junior member of the family he had no authority to mortgage the interests of the other members in the family property As to the first of these questions it must be admitted that though in paragraph of the plaint there is a reference to some of the mortgaged items standing in the name of the first defendant the plaint proceed mainly on the footing that the mortgage was made for purposes of the joint family business and is therefore binding upon whatever interest the other members of the family possessed in the mortgaged items If the matter rested upon presumptions alone Mr <NAME> is probably justified in the contention that the presumption arising in favour of the joint character at the time of the mortgage may well be set against the presumption arising from the non inclusion of these properties in the partition suit of and the presumption of the completeness of a partition when one takes place so that at the time when the question arises in this suit there is no scope for the application of any presumption in favour of the joint family character of the properties It must also be remembered that in this case cloth Shop No was undoubtedly a concern of the joint family and there is no reason why the first defendant should mortgage what he considered his self acquired properties for the liabilities of that shop Even if the question stood as an abstract proposition of law there is much to be said in favour of the view that if the first defendant was the accredited agent of the family for the purpose of managing Shop No to the extent of being empowered to bind the members of the family for debts incurred in connexion with that shop he would also be entitled to pledge the credit of the family and its properties for such debts It seems to us meaningless to say in a case like the present as the learned Subordinate Judge has held that the creditor could bring the family property to sale for the realisation of the debt under Ex It may be that the learned Judges in that case took the view that the security was not created in circumstances making the creation of a mortgage necessary but their observations do not read as if they intended to exclude the possibility of the first defendant ever being able to create a valid mortgage even for binding debts There again the learned Judges based their conclusion on the circumstances of the particular case namely that for some reason the parties made the transaction a personal one of the junior member and the plaint sought to enforce it on that basis and not on the footing that it was entered to by him as the accredited agent of the family The respondents no doubt wanted to use that circumstance as an argument in favour of the nominal character of the mortgage but as we have found on the other evidence in the case that the transaction was genuine and fully supported by consideration that circumstance really seems to us to further the clue for the other people not joining in it though by their later conduct they have clearly shown that this transaction had their full approval This is another circumstance indicating that the family regarded the transaction as binding on them for otherwise there was no reason for them to appropriate that amount in part satisfaction of this claim and this endorsement is attested by the fourth defendant Having regard therefore to the conduct of the family in not attempting to impeach the suit transaction at any time and particularly to the conduct of the fourth defendant in admitting it in the insolvency proceedings and of the Official Receiver in accepting the mortgage and selling the property subject to it and the attitude taken by defendants to and in this litigation in remaining ex parte we think the proper inference is that the suit mortgage was executed by the first defendant with the knowledge and approval of all the other members of the family in the circumstances above stated and as it has been found to be for a debt binding on the family we think that the lower Court erred in holding that the mortgage was not binding on the interests of the other members
