In the latter books corresponding to there is an entry of the sum of Rs As against the finding of the income tax officer dated the petitioner has preferred an appeal which is pending This rule was issued by <NAME> on the th July calling upon the respondents to show cause why a writ in the nature of mandamus prohibition or certiorari should not be issued preventing the implementation of the order of assessment dated the th March and the certificate issued thereon Dr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the petitioner has taken the following points That there was no proper notice under Section Income tax Act Dr <NAME> concedes that this is binding upon me but he points out that the decision itself is subject to an appeal pending before <ORG> and he does not wish the point to be taken as abandoned The grounds upon which action can be taken under this section are where income profits or gains chargeable to income tax Have escaped assessment or Have been under assessed or Assessed at too low a rate or Have been made the subject of excessive relief or Excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed Dr <NAME> argues that where such income gain or profits have escaped assessment it is a case of assessment of the amount which has escaped but where there is under assessment there is no question of assessment but it is a case of reassessment He says that the section grants jurisdiction to the I Officer to re assess an existing assessment where it is found to be under assessed but once it is re assessed there is no further power given to re assess a re assessment It is somewhat surprising that although this situation must have frequently arisen there is no authoritative decision so that it is a matter of first impression The income from the <ORG> shop has escaped assessment but the assessee has also been underassessed Suppose he is proceeded against under Section and his income from the <ORG> shop taken into consideration Within this time limit there is no restriction imposed as to the number of proceedings that can be taken to re open the assessment whether by way of assessment or re assessment computation or re computation If of course the process is repeated mala fide if there is any dishonest motive or if it can be shown that it is being done for a collateral purpose this <ORG> can and will always interfere I must therefore hold that the only point urged on behalf of the petitioner has failed
