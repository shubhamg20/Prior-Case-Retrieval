a and What is Object of Trafficking in trade mark What is Ascertainment of bonafide intention to use trade mark Whether dependant on the facts and circumstances of each case Whether continuous chain of events even subsequent to the application for registration to be considered Intention to use trade mark sought to be registered Must be genuine and real at the date of application for registration Whether the words proposed to be used by him in mean proposed to be used by the proprietor his agents and servants Effect of sub of on sub of What is On August the appellant filed an application under of the Trade Marks Act in Form TM I for registration of the trade mark Dristan in class claiming to be its proprietor and that the same was proposed to be used by it On January the appellant filed a notice of opposition to the registration of the mark Tristine on the ground that it was deceptively similar to its trade mark Dristan The appellant thereupon filed an appeal in <ORG> which was allowed by a Single Judge on Feb On October another agreement was entered into between the appellant ant <ORG> for granting to the latter the non exclusive right to use the trade mark Dristan upon or in relation to the goods in respect of which the said trade mark was registered during the unexpired residue of the term of the registration of the said trade mark Under this agreement <ORG> agreed to become the registered user of the trade mark Dristan ant further agreed that the rights granted to it under the agreement would not be deemed to entitle it to use the trade mark otherwise than as the registered user thereof The first respondent on April filed with <ORG> an application under and of the Act for rectifying the register of Trade Marks by removing therefrom the appellant trade mark Dristan on the grounds i That the trade mark Dristan is deceptively ant confusingly similar to the trade mark Bistan already registered in class ant which has been used and is being used The appeal filed by the first respondent was allowed by the Single Judge holding that at the date of the making Of the application for registration the appellant did not have a bona fide intention to use the trade mark Dristan by itself that the appellant had not at any time used the said trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which it was registered that the legal fiction created by of the Act came into play only after a trade mark was registered and that an intention to use the trade mark through someone who would subsequently get himself registered as a registered user did not amount to an intention on the part of the applicant for registration to use the trade mark himself and that to accept the appellant contention would amount to permitting trafficking in trade marks In the appeal filed by the appellant <ORG> held that trade mark Dristan was not deceptively and confusingly similar to the trade mark Bistan Dismissing the appeal it however agreed with the view taken by the Single Judge in respect of the construction which he had placed upon ss and of the Act to come to the conclusion that the appellant had no bona fide intention to use itself the trade mark Dristan and that the appellant had not at any time made use of the said trade mark In the appeal to this <ORG> on behalf of the appellant it was contended the legal fiction created by sub of as expressly stated in that sub section for the purposes of or for any other purpose for which such use is material under the Act or any other law The facts and circumstances of the case show that the appellant had at the date of the making of the application for registration a bona fide intention to use the trade mark Dristan through a registered user The appellant had fradulently obtained registration of the trade mark Dristan by stating in the application for registration that it proposed to use the said trade mark itself and by not disclosing the fact that it proposed to use it through a proposed registered user Before a person can make an application under to take off a trade mark from the <ORG> he has to be a person aggrieved The distinction between cl a and cl is that if the period specified in cl has elapsed and during that period there has been no bona fide use of the trade mark the fact that the registered proprietor had a bona fide intention to use the trade mark at the date of the application for registration becomes immaterial and the trade mark is liable to be removed from the <ORG> unless his case falls under while under cl a where there had been a bona fide intention to use the trade mark in respect of which registration was sought merely because the trade mark had not been used for a period shorter than five years from the date of its registration will not entitle any person to have that trade mark taken off the <ORG> Thus where there has been a non User of the trade mark for a continuous period of five years and the application for taking Off the trade mark from the <ORG> has been filed one month after the expire of such period the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the <ORG> has only to prove such continuous non user and has not to prove the lack of a bona fide intention on the part of the registered proprietor to use the trade mark at the date of the application for registration Where however the non user is for a period of less than five years the person seeking to remove the trade mark from the <ORG> has not only to prove non user for the requisite period but has also to prove that the applicant for registration of the trade mark had no bona fide intention to use the trade mark when the application for registration was made The definition of trade mark contained in cl of shows that a trade mark is a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark Its object to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark either with or without any indication of the identity of that person when a person gets his trade mark registered he acquires valuable rights by reason of such registration To get a trade mark registered without any intention to use <ORG> in relation to any goods but merely to make money out of it by selling to others the right to use it would be trafficking in that trade mark The intention to use a trade mark sought to be registered must be genuine and real and the fact that the mark was thought to be something which some day might be useful would not amount to any definite ant precise intention at the time of registration to use that trade mark A In the instant case in order to ascertain the intention of the appellant at the date of filing of application for registration the facts could be summarised with reference to three periods events which took place upto the date of the application for registration namely August events which happened between that date and the date of Application for Rectification namely April and events which happened subsequently to April On August the appellant filed an application for regls tratlon of the trade mark Drlstan and the said trade mark was tuly registered on June Further <ORG> applied to <ORG> under of the Industrials Development and regulation Act for a licence to manufacture Dristan tablets which was granted to <ORG> On March the appellant and <ORG> jointly made an application to register <ORG> as a registered user of the trade mark Dristan The Act however also made provisions with respect to registered users and created a similar legal fiction in of that Act Under on application for registration of a trade mark can only be made by a person who claims to be the proprietor of that trade mark Therefore the words applicant for registration in cl a of would mean the person claiming to be the proprietor of the trade mark who is the applicant for registration of that trade mark can also be applied to in the light of the legal fiction would read as any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or proposed to be used by him or by a registered user the English Act of however introduced a system of official approval for licences to use a trade mark particularly by providing for registering a person other than the proprietor of the trade mark as the registered user of the trade mark In the absence of any binding authority of an Indian <ORG> on a particular point of law English decisions in which judgments were delivered by judges held in high repute can be referred to as they are decisions of courts of a country from which Indian Jurisprudence and a large part of Indian Law derived for they are authorities of high persuasive value to which the court may legitimately turn for assistance but whether the rule Laid down in any of these case can be applied by Indian courts lust however be judged in the context of Indian laws and legal procedure and the practical realities of litigation in India That fiction is for the purpose of Which correspond to section of the Act and for any other purpose for which such use is material under the English Act at common law The effect of therefore is that an application for registering a person as a registered user can be made simu<ORG>aneously with the application for registering the trade mark and if both are found to be satisfactory the application for registration would be granted and immediately thereafter the registration of the registered user would be allowed In such a case the intention on the part of the applicant for registration that the trade mark should be used by the registered user thereof is to be deiced to be an intention to use that trade mark by the applicant for registration So far as the application for registering a person as a registered user is concerned he has to forward <ORG> together with his report to <ORG> and it for <ORG> to decide whether to permit such application to be granted or Lot in order to decide this <ORG> or to take into account the matters set out in subs After <ORG> has taken its decision the Registrar is to dispose of the application in accordance with the directions issued by <ORG> Thus while under the English Act the authority to decide an application for registering a registered user is the same as the authority for registering a trade mark under the Act they are different and are the considerations which are to be taken into account It is not necessary that the appellant should have got the trade mark registered with the intention that it will itself use the trade mark and in order to effectuate that intention the appellant should have set up a factory and manufactured and marketed the tablets DRISTAN and then either assigned the trade mark to <ORG> or to get <ORG> registered as the registered user of that trade mark Even if a foreign proprietor of a trade mark were to establish an industry of his own in India it would be absurd to imagine that it would thereafter cease manufacturing the goods and allow someone else to do It is equally illogical that the appellant and <ORG> should have jointly applied for registration of the trade mark DRISTAN There was no need for it to seek other collaborators to establish a new company A It is a well known principle of interpretation of statutes that a construction should not be put upon a statutory provision which would lead to manifest absurdity of futility palpable injustice ox absurd inconvenience or anomaly The <ORG> did not accept the recommendation made in Shavakasha Committee Report and Ayyanagar Report In the instant case the facts on the record show that only when it was decided to introduce DRISTAN tablets in the Indian market through <ORG> that the appellant made its application to register the trade mark DRISTAN There was a close connection in the course of trade between the appellant and <ORG> There was here therefore no question of any trafficking in a trade mark In these circumstances the intention of the appellant to use the trade mark DRISTAN through <ORG> which was subsequently to get itself registered as the registered user of the said trade mark cannot but be characterised as bona fide Lr A The two conditions of cl of are cumulative and since the first condition has not been satisfied in this case it la unnecessary to consider the question whether the appellant had in addition to having a bona fide intention to use the trade mark Dristan had also used it within a period of one mouth before the date of Application for Rectification The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This Appeal has been filed pursuant to a certificate granted by <ORG> against its judgment and order dated December in Appeal The grounds on which the certificate has been given are i that the value of the subjectmatter in dispute in the court of the first instance and still in dispute on appeal was and is not less than Rs and that as the judgment in appeal was one of affirmance the appeal involves a substantial question of law and ii that the case was a fit one for appeal to <ORG> <ORG> obserbed The appeal raises a question of great importance in Trade Marks Law that is to say whether a proprietor of a trade mark who intends to use it solely by a registered user is entitled to registration of his trade mark under Sec mean proposed to be used by the proprietor his agents and servant only The case also involves the question of construction of sub section of Sec The questions so posed by <ORG> resolve themselves into the following two questions Whether a proprietor of a trade mark who intends to use it solely by a registered user is entitled to registration of high trade mark under section of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act Whether by reason of the provisions of sub section of section of the Trade and Merchandise marks Act the words proposed to be used by him in sub section of section of the said Act mean proposed to be used by the proprietor his agents and servants only or do they also include a proposed user by someone who will get himself registered under section of the said Act as a registered user <ORG> further observed The matter is of considerable importance to foreign proprietors of trade marks to registered users of trade marks in general and to the Industry and Commerce at large Before embarking on a discussion of the above questions it will be convenient to relate first the facts which have given rise to this Appeal On January the Appellant filed a notice of opposition to the registration of the said mark TRISTINE on re ground that it was deceptively similar to its trade mark DRISTAN The Appellant thereupon filed an appeal in <ORG> which was allowed by a learned Single Judge of that <ORG> on February The licence under the Industries Development and Regulation Act was granted to <ORG> on January for the manufacture of DRISTAN tablets to the extent of five lakh tablets per month On October an agreement was entered into between the Appellant and <ORG> for granting to <ORG> the non exclusive right to use the trade mark DRISTAN upon or in relation to the goods in respect of which the said trade mark was registered during the unexpired residue of the term of the registration of the said trade mark and during all extensions of the same subject to the determination of the said agreement as provided therein By the said agreement <ORG> agreed to become the registered user of the said trade mark DRISTaN and further agreed that the rights granted to it under the said agreement would not be deemed to entitle it to use the said trade mark otherwise than as the registered user thereof The said agreement provided that in the event of any breach or default by <ORG> of any of the conditions contained in the said agreement the appellant would have the right to prohibit forthwith further use by <ORG> of the trade mark DRISTAN On March a joint application in Form TM was made by the Appellant and the <ORG> for registering the <ORG> as a registered user of the trade mark DRISTAN in respect of the goods for which it was registered subject to the following conditions or restrictions set out in the said application The Trade Mark is to be used by the registered user in relation to the goods only so long as the goods are manufactured in accordance with the formulae and specifications prescribed and supplied by the registered proprietor only so long as the registered user conforms to the technical advice tendered and uses the quality control methods prescribed by or on behalf of the registered proprietor in the course of manufacture of the goods and only so long as the registered proprietor has a right to inspect on the premises of the registered user the goods the installations manufacturing processes and control methods used in the manufacture of the goods and is supplied on request with samples of the goods Thereupon the Appellant filed a further appeal being Appeal No of Fleet Street Reports dismissed the said appeal with no order as to costs In order to appreciate what was held by the Registrar of Trade Marks and the learned Single Judge and <ORG> of the Calcutta high Court and to test the correctness of the rival submissions advanced before us it is now necessary to refer to the relevant statutory provisions Clause of section defines the expression trade mark inter alia as meaning a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right either as proprietor or as registered user to use the mark whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person The Appellant trade mark DISTAN leaving been registered under the Act it became part of Part A of the Register of Trade Marks under the Act Sub section of section of the Act which corresponds to sub section of section of the Act sets out the requisites for registration cf a trade mark The Appellant application for registration of the trade mark DRISTAN was made under section of the Act which provided a follows Admittedly in this case the trade mark DRISTAN was not at any time used by the Appellant in India at the date when it made its application for registration on August nor did it claim in its application that the said trade mark had been used by it These provisions made in sections and of the Act correspond to section of the Act under section of the Act which corresponds to section of the Act the registration of a trade mark is to be for a period of seven years but can be renewed from time to time on application made by the registered proprietor of the trade mark in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period and subject to the payment of the prescribed fee Where in a case to which sub section applies a trade mark in respect of any goods is registered in the name of an applicant who relies on intention to assign the trade mark to a company then unless within such period as may be prescribed or within such further period not exceeding six months as the Registrar may on application being made to him in the prescribed manner allow the company has been registered as the proprietor of the trade marks in respect of those goods the registration shall ceased to have effect in respect thereof at the expiration of that period and the Registrar shall amend the register accordingly Subject to the provisions of section a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a that the trade mark was registered without any bonafide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or in a case to which the provisions of section apply by the company concerned and that there ha in fact been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of the application or that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being Provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub section of section to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application under clause a or clause in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevant date or during the relevant period at the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered The First Respondent said application for rectification was made both under section and of the Act Under section this power can also be exercised by <ORG> or the Registrar of its own motion after giving notice to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard This power includes the power to cancel or vary the registration of a trade mark Against such an order made by the Registrar rectifying cancelling or removing a trade mark from the Register of Trade Marks an appeal lies under section to a Single Judge of <ORG> and against an order made by the Single Judge of <ORG> a further appeal lies to a Bench of <ORG> What is now required to be set out is section of the Act the interpretation of which is crucial for the purpose of deciding this Appeal for that section provides for registration of a registered user and the effect of such registration Subject to the provisions of section a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but <ORG> may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be entertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks Section prescribes the procedure for registration of a registered user and is in the following terms The Registrar shall dispose of the application in accordance with the directions issued by the <ORG> sub section section confers upon <ORG> by notification published in THE Official Gazette and subject to the condition of previous publication the power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the At Consideration by <ORG> <ORG> on receipt of an application for registration as registered user forwarded to it by the Registrar under sub section of section shall if satisfied that the application and the accompanying documents comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules consider whether the APPLIED cation should be allowed having regard to the matters specified in sub section of that section and in doing so may take into account all or any of the following matters whether the permitted use if allowed would contravene the policy of the Act which is to prevent trafficking in trade marks whether the registered proprietor has registered the trade mark without any bona fide intention to use it in relation to his goods in the course of trade or solely or mainly for the purpose of permitting others to use it under agreements for registered user and whether the registered proprietor has acquired title to the trade mark by assignment without any bona fide intention to use it in relation to his goods in the course of trade or solely or mainly for the purpose of permitting others to use it under agreements for registered user The second ground mentioned above was taken in order make out that the First Respondent was a person aggrieved for the purposes of section and of the Act ii That the said trade mark was registered in contravention of Section of the Trade Marks Act corresponding to Section of the present Act of In coming to the conclusion that the Appellant had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark DRISTAN the Registrar relied upon the decision of Lloyd Jacob in the case of BOSTITCH Trade Mark In the appeal filed by the First Respondent against the order of the Registrar the learned single Judge held that at the date of the making of the application for registration the Appellant did not have a bona fide intention to use the trade mark DRISTAN by itself According to the learned Single Judge the legal fiction created by section of the Act came into play only after a trade mark was registered and that an intention to use a trade mark through someone who would subsequently get himself registered as a registered user did not amount to an intention on the part of the applicant for registration to use the trade mark himself It however confirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge in respect of the construction which he had placed upon section and of the Act in order to come to the conclusion that the Appellant had no bona fide intention to use itself the trade mark DRISTAN and that the Appellant had not at any time made use of the said trade mark The main judgment of the division each was delivered by <NAME> with whom <NAME> agreed and at the conclusion of his judgment <NAME> pointed out the hardship which the construction placed by <ORG> upon section and of the Act would lead to A legal situation which permits use of a registered trade mark by a registered user but disqualifies the proprietor from registering his mark if he intends to use it only through a registered user even when a user is available who is ready and willing to be registered on terms which are unexceptionable is a situation fraught with three quarters irony and the rest unconscious humour proper construction of the relevant sections of the Act shows that there is neither any cause for sardonic merriment nor any need to shed tears The submissions made at the hearing of this Appeal by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the Appellant may be thus summarized To confine this fiction to a case of an actual use of a trade mark by a registered user is to confine it only to use for the purposes of clause of section which is contrary to the purpose for which the said fiction Was created and therefore when section of the Act corresponding to section of the Act uses the words proposed to be used these words must be read as proposed to be used by a proposed registered user The reliance placed by <ORG> both by the learned single Judge and <ORG> upon the PUSSY GALORE Trade Mark Case was unjustified and unwarranted inasmuch as the provisions of the English Act namely the Trade Marks Act are radically different from those of the Act as also the Act an therefore that case has no relevance so far as the construction of section read with section of the Act is concerned The reliance placed by <ORG> both by the learned single Judge and <ORG> upon the Shavaksha Committee Report and the Ayyangar Report was equally misplaced as <ORG> did not accept the recommendations with respect to registered users made in either of these reports The facts and circumstances of the case show that the appellant had at the date of the making of the application for registration a bona fide intention to use the trade mark DRISTAN through a registered user The words proposed to be used in section of the Act and section of the Act mean proposed to be used by the applicant for registration his servants and agents and not by any person who is proposed to be got registered as a registered user and therefore the legal fiction enacted in section cannot be imported into section The Appellant had fradulently obtained registration of the trade mark DRISTAN by stating in the application for registration that it proposed to use the said trade mark itself and by not disclosing the fact that it proposed to use it through a proposed registered user An entry relating to a mark the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion would be an entry wrongly remaining on the Register and therefore liable to be expunged therefrom Before a person can made an application under section to take off a trade mark from the <ORG> he has to be a person aggrieved Section provides for two cases in which a registered trade mark may be taken off the <ORG> in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered There are two conditions to be satisfied before clause a can become applicable The distinction between clause a and clause is that if the period specified in clause has elapsed and during that A period there has been no bona fide use of the trade mark the fact that the registered proprietor had a bona fide intention to use the trade mark at the date of the application for registration becomes immaterial and the trade mark is liable be removed from the Register unless his case falls under section while under clause a where there had been a bona fide intention to use the trade mark in respect of which registration was sought merely because the trade mark had not been used for a period shorter than five years from the date of its registration will not entitle any person to have that trade mark taken off the Register Under both these clauses the burden of proving that the facts which bring into play clause a or clause as the case may be exists is on the person who seeks to have the trade mark removed from the <ORG> the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the <ORG> has only to prove such continuous non user and has not to prove the lack of a bona fide intention on the part of the registered proprietor to use the trade mark at the date of the application for registration Where however the non user is for a period of less than five years the person seeking to remove the trade mark from the <ORG> has not only to prove non user for the requisite period but has also to prove that the applicant for registration of the trade mark had no bona fide intention to use the trade mark when the application for registration was made As the definition of trade mark contained in clause of section shows a trade mark is a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark There are innumerable preparatory steps required to be taken and formalities to be complied with before the manufacture of goods can start and the manufactured goods marketed The processes must of necessity take time Its object is to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark either with or without any indication of the identity of that person Trade marks became important after the Industrial Revolution a distinguish goods made by one person from those made by another and soon the need was felt to protect traders against those who were unauthorizedly using their marks and accordingly registration of trade marks was introduced in England by the Trade Marks Registration Act which was soon replaced by more detailed and advanced legislation When a person gets his trade mark registered he acquires valuable rights by reason of such registration Registration of his trade mark gives him the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in respect of which it is registered and if there is any invasion of this right by any other person using a mark which is the same or deceptively similar to his trade mark he can protect his trade mark by an action for infringement in which he can obtain injunction damages or an account of profits made by the other person To get a trade nark registered Without any intention to use it in relation to any Gods but merely to make money out of it by selling to others the right to use it would be trafficking in that trade mar but there is no statutory definition of trafficking and one may suspect that as with usury in the middle Ages though it is known to be a deadly sin it has become less and less clear as economic circumstances have developed what the sin actually comprehends In the same case Lord <NAME> in the house of Lords All summed up the position in law thus My Lords although as a matter of ordinary English trafficking in trade marks might mean the buying and selling of trade marks it seems obvious that it is to have a more specialised meaning in a trade mark context if tiler is no real trade connection between the proprietor of the mark and the licensee or his goods there is room for the conclusion that the grant of the licence is a trafficking in the ark We have no hesitation in accepting the meaning given to the expression trafficking in a trade Dillon LJ The intention to use a trade mark sought to be registered must be therefore genuine and real and as pointed out by <NAME> in In re ducker Trade mark Ch the fact that the mark was as thought to be something which some day might be useful would not amount to any definite and precise intention at the time of registration to use that mark In fact section a expressly speaks of bona fide intention on the part of the application for registration which would mean at the date when such applicant makes his application for registration We will now address ourselves to the question whether the facts which bring into play clause a of section exist in the present case Assuming the Appellant had such an intention the next question which will fall to be determined is whether this intention was an intention on the part of the Appellant to use the said trade mark itself or to use it through a registered user and if he intention was to use it through a registered user whether clause a of section would be attracted the Court can only look at events previous to the relevant date namely the date of the application for registration made by the Appellant that is August and not to any events subsequent thereto Whether subsequent events are relevant or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the question at issue therein Emperor A I Appellant No a Salt Agent for the District Magistrate was inter alia charged with having abetted Appellant No who had been appointed by him in selling salt to licensed retail dealers to whom allocations of specific quantities of salt had been made by the Central Government on three specified dates at a price exceeding the maximum price which had been fixed by the District Magistrate In addition to the evidence of the three dealers to whom the salt was sold nine other dealers who had bought salt from appellant No and had to deal with Appellant No and had obtained salt from him at a price exceeding the fixed maximum price were also called in evidence as prosecution witnesses At that time learned Counsel for the first Respondent got up and requested Us that the Appellant should also be asked to produce copies of the said two agreements and accordingly we directed the Appellant to file copies of those two agreements also which it did We will now summarize these facts with reference to three periods events which took place up to the date of the application for registration namely August events which happened between that date an the date of he Application for Rectification namely April and events which happened subsequent to April lt is true that Schedule A to the said agreement does not mention DRlSTAN tablets but the products set out in schedule A are not exhaustive of the Licensed Products to which the said collaboration agreement related and this is made clear by the rule of the word include with reference to the products identified in Schedule A There is no dispute that DRISTAN tablets are <ORG> Further it applied to <ORG> under section of the Industries Development and Regulation Act for a licence to manufacture DRISTAN tablets which was granted to it On March the <ORG> and <ORG> jointly made an application to register <ORG> as a registered user of the trade mark DRISTAN This brings us to the question whether the intention of the Appellant to market and manufacture DRISTAN tablets in India was to do so itself or to do so through a registered user The facts of this case clearly establish that the Appellant intention in applying for registration of the trade mark DRISTAN was to use it in relation to goods to be manufactured and marketed by <ORG> and that for this purpose <ORG> would get itself registered as the registered user of the said trade mark The Appellant application for registration of the trade mark DRISTAN was made under section of the Act and was registered under that Act Under the said section only a person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark use or proposed to be used by him could apply for registration of that trade mark This brings us to the crucial question whether the words proposed to be used by him would include proposed to be used through a registered proprietor On behalf of the Appellant it was submitted by Mr <NAME> that the two phrases proposed to be used by him ant proposed to be used by a registered user must be equated by reason of the statutory legal fiction created by section of the Act which corresponds to section of the Act He also submitted that the legal fiction enacted in section of the Act and section of the Act cannot for this reason apply to the provisions of section or to the first condition of clause a of section of the Act and therefore the Appellant was not entitled to seek the protection of the said legal fiction According to Dr <NAME> if the proprietor of a trade mark intended to use it through another he could only do it by having resort to section of the Act which corresponds to section of the Act by getting it registered for the purpose of assigning it to a company to be formed and registered under the Companies Act The Act however also made provisions with respect to registered users and created a similar legal fiction in section of the Act Under section an application for registration of a trade mark can only be made by a person who claims to be the proprietor of that trade mark Therefore the words applicant for registration in clause a Of section would mean the person claiming to be the proprietor of the trade mark who is the applicant for registration of that trade mark Similarly we see no difficulty in applying the legal fiction in section to section In order to understand what was held in that case it is necessary first to refer to some of the provisions of the English Trade Marks Act Geo The English Act of however introduced a system of official approval for licences to use a trade mark Particularly by providing for registering a Person other than the proprietor of the trade mark as the registered user of the trade mark Where it is proposed that a person should be registered as a registered user of a trade mark the proprietor and the proposed registered user must apply in writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner and must furnish him with a statutory declaration made by the proprietor or by some person authorised to act on his behalf and approved by the Registrar a giving particulars of the relationship existing or proposed between the proprietor and the proposed registered user including particulars showing the degree of control by the proprietor over the permitted use which their relationship will confer and whether it is a term of their relationship that the proposed registered user shall be the sole registered user or that there shall be any other restriction as to persons for whose registration as registered users application may be made stating the goods in respect of which registration is proposed stating any conditions or restrictions proposed with respect to the characteristics of the goods to the mode or place of permitted use or to any other matter and stating whether the permitted use is to be for a period or without limit of period and if for a period the duration thereof and with such further documents information or evidence as may be required under the rules or by the Registrar When the requirements of the last foregoing subsection have been compled with if the Registrar after considering the information furnished to him under that sub section is satisfied that in all the circumstances the use of the trade mark in relation to the proposed goods or any of them by the proposed registered user subject to any conditions or restrictions which the Registrar thinks proper would not be contrary to the public interest the Registrar may register the proposed registered user as a registered user in respect of the goods as to which he is so satisfied subject as aforesaid The provisions of section twenty six of this Act shall have effect in relation to a trade mark registered under the power conferred by the foregoing sub section as if for the reference in paragraph a of sub section of that section to intention on the part of an applicant for registration that a trade mark should be used by him there were substituted a reference to intention on his part that it should be used by the corporation or registered user concerned The applicant appealed to <ORG> and the appeal was heard by <ORG> who dismissed the appeal There is no difficulty about the case of servants and agents because although various executive acts may be performed by them on behalf of their principal who is the applicant for the Dark the use of the mark vis a vis the public is by the applicant and no one else It would be obvious from the provisions of section and also from the definition of trade mark in section that actual use of a trade mark might be exclusively by a registered user and not by the proprietor at all I agree with the Registrar that section is dealing with matters which arise after registration and has no such bearing upon the interpretation of section and as the applicants have contended for assistance but whether the rule laid down in any of these cases can be applied by our courts must however be judged in the context of our own laws and legal procedure and the practical realities of litigation in our country That fiction for the purpose of section which corresponds to section of the Act and for any other purpose for which such use material under the English Act or at common law The second fiction is for the purposes of paragraph a of section which corresponds to clause a of section of the Act In our opinion the omission from the Act of a provision similar to that contained in section of the English Act toes not make any difference if one were to see the said section in its proper setting and context The effect of section therefore is that an application for registering a person as a registered user can be made simultaneously with the application for registering the trade mark and if both are found to be satisfactory the application for registration would be granted and immediately thereafter the registration of the registered user would be allowed In such a case the intention on the part of the applicant for registration that the trade mark should be used by the registered user thereof is to be deemed to be an intention to use that trade mark by the application for registration It appears to us that the purpose for wh ch fiction was created by section with respect to a registered user was to eliminate all possibility of trafficking in a trade mark by a person getting himself registered as the proprietor of a trade mark and thereafter going in search of some person who will use it as the registered user thereof At this stage it is pertinent to note that form No TM which is the form prescribed for an application for registration of a trade mark prescribed by the English Trade Marks Rules was substituted in and under the substituted Form a new column is provided which requires details of an application under section to be given There is another vital point of distinction between the provisions of the English So far as the application for registering a person as a registered user is concerned he has to forward it together with his report to <ORG> and it is for <ORG> to decide whether to permit such application to be granted or not After <ORG> has taken its decision the Registrar is to dispose of the application in accordance With the directions issued by <ORG> Thus while under the English Act the authority to decide an application for registering a registered user is the same as the authority for registering a trade mark under the Act they are different and so are the considerations which are to be taken into account Under the Act an application for registering a registered user can only be made after a trade mark is registered The argument of Dr <NAME> that the Appellant should have got the trade mark registered with the intention that it will itself use the trade mark and in order to effectuate that intention the Appellant should have set up a factory and manufactured and marketed the tablets DRISTAN and then either assigned the trade mark to <ORG> or to get <ORG> registered as the registered user of that trade mark is illogical Even assuming that a foreign proprietor of a trade mark were to be established an industry of his own in India it would be absurd to imagine that it would thereafter cease manufacturing the goods and allow someone else to do There was no need for it to seek other collaborators to establish a new company It is well known principle of interpretation of statutes that a construction should not be put upon a statutory provision which would lead to manifest absurdity or futility palpable injustice or absurd inconvenience or anomaly It turned upon its own facts and what was held in that case was that the provisions of section of the English Act are not mandatory but permissive Both the learned Single Judge and <ORG> were of the opinion that the recommendation made in the <NAME> Report were accepted by the <ORG> <ORG> had recommended the insertion of a provision similar to clause of section of the English Act in section of the Act which corresponds to section of the Act <ORG> did not accept the recommendation made in either of these Reports From what we have said above we must not be understood to mean that a person who does not intend to use a trade mark himself can get it registered and when faced with an application under clause a of section to have that trade mark removed turn round and say that he intended to use it through some person who was proposed to be got registered as a registered user If an applicant for registration did not have at the date of his application for registration a particular registered user in view he cannot be said to have had a bona fide intention to use the trade mark and in such an event he cannot resist ar application made under clause a of section of the Act There was a close connection in the course of trade between the <ORG> and <ORG> There was here therefore no question of any trafficking in a trade mark In these circumstances the intention of the <ORG> to use the trade mark DRISTAN through <ORG> which was subsequently to get itself registered as the registered user of the said trade mark cannot but be characterized as bona fide Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the Appellant also urged that in addition to having a bona fide intention to use the trade mark DRISTAN the Appellant had also used it within a period of one month before the date of the Application for Rectification Apart from that there is no substance in this point It is not fair to produce copies of any circular or notification along with written submissions after oral arguments have closed because the other side has no opportunity to meet this case The application for registering <ORG> as the registered user of the said trade mark is still pending and when <ORG> comes to consider that application it will decide the matter for itself
