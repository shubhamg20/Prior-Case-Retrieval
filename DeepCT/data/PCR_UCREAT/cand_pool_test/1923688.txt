The <ORG> failed to comply with <ORG> direction and the appellants filed petitions in <ORG> of Patna for quashing the advertisement dated and for a direction to appoint and absorb them in the vacant substantive posts of Junior Electrical Engineers <ORG> dismissed the petitions holding that i the power under Section A is to be exercised by <ORG> Government only when some questions of policy are involved and it cannot be exercised for directing that a particular individual or a group of persons be appointed as officers of the <ORG> and the board has power to make appointments under Section and it was not bound to follow the directions of <ORG> because it would amount to encroachment on its power under Section ii the appellants were appointed as Operators on their undertaking and at a later stage they could not claim appointment against the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers iii in view of the amended rule of the <ORG> Junior Electrical Engineer General Cadre Rules the appellants could not be absorbed without consideration of inter se merit by Selection Committee In appeal to this <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the appellants that i the direction issued by <ORG> under Section A of the Act was no question of policy and was binding on the <ORG> ii the undertaking given by the appellants cannot deprive them from being appointed on future vacancies and the undertaking was violative of Article of the Constitution iii the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers were vacant even before the expiry of panel and the <ORG> should have absorbed the appellants against the aforesaid posts On behalf on the <ORG> it was contended that i under section A of the Act the <ORG> can issue directions only on questions of policy and it cannot direct the <ORG> to make appointments dehors the Rules ii the panel for Junior Electrical Engineers was valid for one year and the appellants had no legal right to be appointed on the basis of their inclusion in the expired panel Section of the Electricity Supply Act clearly lays down that the <ORG> shall be guided by such directions on questions of policy as may be given to it by <ORG> Therefore the view taken by <ORG> that the direction given by <ORG> to the <ORG> to appoint the appellants as Junior Engineers does not involve any matter of policy and was an encroachment on the powers of the <ORG> under Section of the Act is correct Therefore the <ORG> cannot deny the right of the appellants for appointment on the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers sought to be filled on the ground that they had given any undertaking at the time of their appointment as Operators As contemplated in Rule of the <ORG> Junior Electrical Engineer General Cadre Rules read with modification made by Notification dated issued under Section of the Act the <ORG> has to make appointments for the posts of Junior Electrical Engineering and by adsorption of the <ORG> employees serving on lower posts in the ratio of and the appellants would also have a right to be considered for such appointments The Judgment of this Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> Special leave granted The successful candidates were called for an interview which was held on different dates in the year On the basis of the above written and oral test a panel of candidates was prepared The petitioners subsequently made claim before the Board and <ORG> that they should be absorbed against the vacant posts of Junior Electrical Engineers on the basis of the merit list and panel prepared in the year It was mentioned in the above communication that the said direction was being issued in exercise of the power under Section A of the Electricity Supply Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The board did not comply with the aforesaid direction of <ORG> as such the petitioners filed a Writ Petition in <ORG> with the prayer to quash the advertisement dated and to appoint absorb the petitioners to the vacant substantive posts of Junior Electrical Engineers Thereafter on the recommendation of a committee the petitioners were appointed against the posts of Operators in Thermal Power Stations with a specific condition that they shall not later make any claim for appointment as Junior Electrical Engineer It was further stated by the <ORG> that <ORG> had no power to give such direction under Section A of the Act The <ORG> itself has power to make appointments of officers and employees under Section of the Act Section of the Act in clear and unambiguous words vests power in the <ORG> to appoint its officers and employees as may be required to enable the <ORG> to carry out the functions under the Act The <ORG> being an autonomous authority clothed with the power to make appointments of its officers and employees under Section of the Act is not bound to follow the directions given by <ORG> which amounted to an encroachment on the power of the <ORG> vested under Section of the Act <ORG> also held that whenever vacancies exist in public offices an opportunity should be given to all persons eligible on the date such posts are to be filled up for being considered for appointed as Operators on undertaking being given by them individually that at later stage they shall not claim for being appointed against the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers In view of this amended Rule which had come into force on now there was no question of absorption of the petitioners outright without consideration of inter se merit by <ORG> <ORG> in the view taken above passed the following order For the reasons mentioned above it is not possible to hold that the two communications dated and shall be deemed to be a direction on question of policy by <ORG> so that this Court may issue a writ of mandamus directing the <ORG> to comply with those Directions We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have perused the record Dr <NAME> Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants contended that the direction issued by <ORG> vide letters dated and under Section A of the Act was binding on the <ORG> It was contended that the directions given in the aforesaid letters was on questions of policy and <ORG> was fully authorised to give such directions to the <ORG> in exercise of its power conferred under Section A of the Act It was submitted that some of the appellants have become over age and it would not be possible for the appellants to compete with the fresh incumbents in case the posts are filled by direct recruitment It was contended that all the appellants are Diploma holders and have additional advantage of experience on the post of Operators and in these circumstances the appellants should be absorbed against the vacant posts of Junior Electrical Engineers without competing with the direct recruits On the other hand Learned Counsel appearing for the <ORG> supported the judgment of <ORG> and contended that the panel of exhausted after one year and thereafter the appellants had no right or claim whatsoever on the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers to be filled now through advertisement issued on It was further submitted that the <ORG> had shown a gesture of goodwill by giving appointment to the appellants on the post of Operators and now the appellants cannot put forth a legal right for being appointed as Junior Electrical Engineers after a period of more than years on the basis of inclusion in the panel of They have to compete with other fresh competitors who have become eligible for such posts to be filled by direct recruitment according to the Rules It has been submitted that Section A of the Act empowers <ORG> to issue directions of policy and no direction under such power can be given to the <ORG> to make appointment of the appellants dehors the Rules In the discharge of its functions the Board shall be guided by such directions on questions of policy as may be given to it by <ORG> The above provision clearly lays down that the <ORG> shall be guided by such directions on questions of policy as may be given to it by <ORG> So far as the appointment of staff is concerned Section empowers the <ORG> to appoint such officers and employees as may be required to enable the <ORG> to carry out its functions under the Act Thus we agree with the view taken by <ORG> in this regard that the direction given by <ORG> to appoint the appellants as Junior Engineers by the <ORG> does not involve any matter of policy and it would be an encroachment on the powers of the <ORG> given under Section of the Act The post of Junior Electrical Engineer is now governed by the Bihar State Electricity Junior Electrical Engineer General Cadre Rules and specially Rule read with modification made by Notification dated issued under Section of the Act which reads as follows Appointments to the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers from amongst the employees of the <ORG> having Diploma in Electrical Engineering will be made on the basis of the recommendations of <ORG> which will be constituted by the Chairman for the purpose <ORG> will examine the records and interview the candidates who obtain diploma in Electrical Engineering while in the service of the <ORG> along with those employees who had obtained diploma in Electrical Engineering before joining the service of the <ORG> Appointment by direct recruitment and by absorption shall be made against vacancies in a calendar year in the ratio of So far as appointment to be made by direct recruitment the candidates have to be selected on the basis of merit after going through the process of written and oral examination and the appellants shall have to compete with all the Diploma holders who would compete for such posts of Junior Electrical Engineers to be filled by direct recruitment The <ORG> in this regard has clearly stated in the counter affidavit filed before this Court that the appellants who apply for the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers as and when advertisement is issued and appear at the competitive examination to be held again by the <ORG> for appointment on the posts of Junior Engineers and in case they Compete they would be appointed against the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers The <ORG> of course cannot deny the right of the appellants for appointment on the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers now sought to be filled on the ground that the appellants had given any undertaking at the time of their appointment as Operators The <ORG> has to make appointments for the posts of Junior Electrical Engineers both by way of direct recruitment from Diploma holders in Electrical Engineering and by absorption of the <ORG> employees serving on lower posts in the ratio of as contemplated in Rule and the appellants would also have a right to be considered for such appointments These persons are also those persons who were included in the panel of person prepared in and who did not qualify in merit for being appointed on posts of Junior Electrical Engineers Thus they are also falling in the same category as that of appellants of appeal arising out of SLP No of There is no allegation that the posts were not released for appointment with any mala fide intention or in order to give benefit to any person by virtue of postponement of filling such vacancies
