This is an appeal from a judgment of the full bench of <ORG> dated November in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No of which on a reference by a division bench of the same <ORG> held that the orders of <NAME> a single Judge of the <ORG> on an application for writ of habeas corpus and relative applications and dated October and made in Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions Nos and of respectively were null and void a judgment and order of the said division bench dated November made in petition No in implement of the above judgment and a judgment and order of the said division bench dated November made in petition No dismissing the application for a writ of habeas corpus The appellants challenge the validity of certain warrants issued by the Resident for the Madras States under Section of the Indian Extradition Act XV of to the Chief Presidency Magistrate of Madras under which they were arrested and they ask to be discharged The course of procedure which has been followed has raised important questions as to the jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue a writ of habeas corpus in the present case and as to the competency of a single Judge of <ORG> to issue such a writ or the analogous writ under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of Whereas Mr <NAME> Director of <ORG> which is now under liquidation who is now reported to be residing at Marble Hall Sterling Road Nungumbakam Madras stands charged with offences punishable under sections and also sections and of the Travancore Penal Code corresponding to sections A and of the Indian Penal Code committed in the Travancore State you are hereby directed to apprehend the said Mr <NAME> and surrender him to the frontier police station of the Travancore State for production before the District Magistrate Trivandrurn to the effect that <ORG> had jurisdiction at common law to issue a writ of habeas corpus and he held that such jurisdiction was vested in each of the Judges of <ORG> and could not be taken away by Rules This petition No came on for hearing on October before <NAME> and <NAME> who as the hearing could not be completed on that day made an order suspending the operation of the writ nisi issued under the order of <NAME> dated October and staying further proceedings on petition No until the further orders of the <ORG> should be known with a direction to the second respondent to keep the prisoners in his custody till further orders After the further hearing on petition No <ORG> on November referred the following questions of law to a full bench Can <ORG> or any Judge of it issue the common law writ of habeas corpus in any of the cases covered by Section of the Criminal Procedure Code Can an application for a common law writ of habeas corpus or for directions under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code be heard and disposed of by a single Judge of this Court In other words Are Rules and a of the Appellate Side Rules intra or ultra vires If a single Judge has power to issue the common law writ of habeas corpus is the writ issued by our learned brother <NAME> on October liable to be quashed by this Court for the reason that it has been issued in contravention of the rules in force in <ORG> in England In the second place the petitioner maintained that even if <ORG> had still power to issue the common law writ of habeas corpus nevertheless Rule was intra vires and binding on all Judges of the <ORG> and that accordingly a single Judge had no power to deal with such proceedings the learned Judges held this to be well founded In the third place the petitioner maintained that even if a single Judge has jurisdiction to issue the common law writ of habeas corpus the procedure in this case had not been proper in that <NAME> had made the writ returnable to himself and not to the <ORG> during term time which was in contravention of the rules in force in <ORG> in England which would apply in the case of a common law writ in <ORG> of Madras the learned Judges agreed with this contention The respondents the present appellants maintained two arguments first that in a criminal matter such as this one there was no right of appeal but the learned Judges held that the <ORG> was entitled to entertain the petition by virtue of Section A of the Criminal Procedure Code Assuming that the <ORG> formerly had the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus in a case like this that power has been taken away and the powers conferred by Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure substituted The position therefore is that the application filed by the respondents under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure must be dealt with in accordance with the rules of the <ORG> which means that it must be dealt with by the Criminal Bench The reasons of the full bench for their judgment were subsequently given on November in a judgment delivered by the Chief Justice The proceedings in petition No were resumed by <ORG> on November when they made an order in accordance with the answer of the full bench setting aside the order of <ORG> in petition No dated October which directed the issue of the writ nisi already referred to After hearing arguments and considering the affidavits the learned Judges delivered judgment and made an order dismissing the petition This appeal is taken against the judgment of the full bench dated November on the questions referred to them in petition No the judgment of the division bench dated November in petition No and the judgment of the division bench dated November dismissing petition No Counsel for the appellants submitted four contentions viz That the warrants were illegal and invalid for the following reasons a that there is definite jurisdiction in <ORG> to examine on evidence whether the conditions laid down by the Extradition Act and the rules made thereunder for issue of the warrants have been complied with that when thus examined it would be found that such conditions had not been complied with that in any event the warrants were ex facie invalid in respect that i they did not show that the conditions had been complied with ii that they did not show sufficiently with what offences the appellants were charged or when they were committed iii that they did not sufficiently show where and to whom the appellants were to be delivered up and iv that they were undated Counsel for the appellants referred to the rules made by the Governor General in <ORG> under Section of the Indian Extradition Act as to the Procedure of Political Agents for Surrender of Accused Persons to Native States No The Political Agent shall not issue a warrant under Section of the said Act except on a request preferred to him in writing either by or by the authority of the person for the time being administering <ORG> of the State for which he is a Political Agent or by any Court within such State which has been specified in this behalf by the Governor General in <ORG> or by the Governor of Madras or Bombay in <ORG> as the case may be by notification in the official <ORG> On this point their Lordships agree with the conclusions of the full bench in the present case which are stated in the judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice as follows The High <ORG>s Act of authorised the <ORG> if it thought fit to take away the powers which this <ORG> obtained as the successor of the Supreme <ORG> and Acts of the <ORG> lawfully passed in and subsequent years leave no doubt in my mind that the <ORG> has taken away the power to issue the prerogative writ of habeas corpus in matters contemplated by Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Court may whenever it thinks fit direct that a person illegally or improperly detained in public or private custody within such limits i the limits of its appellate criminal jurisdiction be set at liberty <ORG> may from time to time frame rules to regulate the procedure in cases under this Section Their Lordships are unable to accept this contention and their view is confirmed by the terms of the statutory notifications in <ORG> as to Rule A which first appeared in a somewhat different form in the <ORG> Part II under date January in which it is expressly described as an amendment to the rules regulating proceedings under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure and it was as follows All applications for writ of habeas corpus shall go before a Bench of three Judges of which the Chief Justice unless otherwise ordered shall be one It only remains to deal with the appellants contentions as to the warrants In the first place they maintained that the <ORG> is entitled to examine on evidence whether the conditions laid down by the Extradition Act and the rules made under Section of the Act have been complied with and that the appellants were entitled to an opportunity to satisfy the <ORG> a that the offences must have been committed in Madras and that in reality the Travancore authorities desired to get the appellants into their jurisdiction in order to charge them with political offences which would not be extraditable offences It must be remembered that the warrants are issued by the agent of <ORG> and not by an agent of the Travan core State and this executive act is safeguarded in various ways by the Act and by the rules For instance Rule provides that the Political Agent shall in all cases before issuing a warrant under Section of the Act satisfy himself by preliminary inquiry or otherwise that there is prima facie a case against the accused person Their Lordships see no reason why the offences charged cannot have been committed in Travancore and what they have stated above directly applies to the suggestion that the true object of the extradition is to enable the appellants to be charged with political offences Lastly the appellants contend that the warrants are illegal ex facie in respect a that they do not sufficiently show with what offences the appellants were charged or when they were committed that they do not sufficiently identify the place where and the person to whom the appellants were to be delivered up and that they are undated As regards a no form of warrant is prescribed by the Extradition Act or the rules and the warrants clearly describe the offences with which the appellants are charged which is all that is required by the ordinary form of warrant of arrest prescribed by Section and form II of Schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure It is clear that the second respondent has no difficulty in this regard and if there were any doubt on the warrants taken by themselves which their Lordships are not prepared to assume the matter is placed beyond doubt by <ORG> Home Department Order No March under which the Government direct that in future all persons extradited should be handed over at the nearest frontier police station in the Travancore State
