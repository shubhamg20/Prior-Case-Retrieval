Dr <NAME> learned Senior Counsel appearing for the <ORG> clarified that he has instructions to make a statement on the amended circular that now there is no reservation for ladies in the general category It is also clarified that if any candidate belonging to Schedule Caste Schedule Tribe Other Backward Class categories is selected in open competition on the basis of merit then he will not be adjusted in the seats reserved for concerned categories Though this contention has not been specifically raised in these writ petitions we must yet take notice of this circumstance while making the appropriate directions in these matters The <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh shall keep this in mind for future selections as also in respect of those which may be now under way and make necessary corrections We may now turn to the contentions raised in the writ petition Accordingly a corrigendum was issued by <ORG> calling upon the candidates belonging to these special categories to specify to which social reservation category they belong According to the counter affidavit now filed on behalf of the respondents it appears that out of candidates who had applied against the five special reservation categories only nine stated that they belong to Other Backward Classes In the Counter affidavit filed by the respondent sworn to by Sri <NAME> it is stated that the total number of seats available in course in the government colleges in Uttar Pradesh is The question is which of the above interpretations is the correct one having regard to the language employed in the concerned notifications On a careful consideration of the revised notification of December and the aforementioned corrigendum issued by <ORG> we are of the opinion that in view of the ambiguous language employed therein it is not possible to give a definite answer to the question whether the horizontal reservations are overall reservations or compartmentalised reservations As a matter of fact it may not be totally correct to presume that <ORG> was not aware of this distinction between overall horizontal reservation since it appears from the judgment in <NAME> that in the first notification issued by <ORG> on May the thirty percent reservation for ladies was split up into each of the other reservations <ORG> and If this is not done there is always a possibility of one or the other vertical reservation category suffering prejudice as has happened in this case If reservations are made both under clause as well as under the vacancies available for free competition as well as reserved categories would be correspondingly whittled down and that is not a reasonable thing to do Though the said observations were made with reference to clauses and of Article the same apply with equal force to clauses and of Article as well When a writ petition was filed in this court probably some writ petitions in <ORG> also the Government realised its mistake and issued the revised notification on December Accordingly we direct that in the matter of admissions made pursuant to while the admissions already finalised shall not be disturbed <ORG> shall create thirty four additional seats in the couse and admit thirty four students from the category against those seats It is made clear that category means the merit list and no distinction shall be made among the candidates in the list on the basis of their social status because it is well settled that even a candidate is entitled to obtain a seat in the category on the basis of his merit
