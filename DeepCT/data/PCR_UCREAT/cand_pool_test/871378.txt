This appeal raises a single question of fact upon which the <ORG> in India have differed The only controversy left is as to whether the suit was barred by limitation There are a few facts and some dates about which there is no doubt In support of that case there were also three witnesses called of whom it is enough to say that their evidence is as unsatisfactory as that of the plaintiffs witnesses The Subordinate Judge who tried the case came to the conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove her story as to the date of her birth He further thought that it was shown that the birth took place at the end of and he dismissed the suit This point is purely one of fact and there is no evidence to support it It appears to their Lordships very dangerous to adopt such a conclusion in a Court of appeal merely on the suggestion of the legal gentlemen representing one of the parties <ORG> further considered that some of the witnesses for the defence tended to support the plaintiff case but it appears to their Lordships that that evidence is too vague and unsatisfactory to lend material support to either case Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that the decree of <ORG> should be discharged with costs The first respondent will pay the costs of the appeal
