He alleged that the defendants to have been threatening to dispossess him Appellant plaintiff filed the suit on for a decree of permanent injunction restraining defendant Nos to from dispossessing him Along with the institution of the suit he moved an application under Order Rule and of the Code of Civil Procedure for short the Code to pass an ad interim injunction restraining respondents to or their men or agents or their representatives or any person claiming through them or under them from evicting the petitioner from the suit property other than by due process of law and to pass such further or other order or orders The first respondent on behalf of himself and respondent Nos to filed a revision petition invoking Article of the Constitution before <ORG> alleging that they purchased the property from the owners thereof as per different sale documents executed on and they were in possession and enjoyment of the property Learned Single Judge of <ORG> who disposed of the revision made the observation that the trial court ought not have granted an order of injunction at the first stage itself which could operate beyond thirty days as the court had then no occasion to know of what the affected party has to say about it He therefore set aside the injunction order for the clear transgression of the provisions of law and noted that this is the third suit filed in reference to the suit property and hence deprecated the grant of ex parte injunction without notice Though learned single judge further declined to go into the other allegations he has chosen to make the following observations also However prima facie I am satisfied that these materials are relevant for consideration before granting ad interim injunction But there is no document to show that the first respondent is actually in possession and running such a business except the lease deed <NAME> learned Senior Counsel contended that <ORG> should not have entertained a petition under Article of the Constitution when the respondent had two remedies statutorily available to him First is that the respondent could have approached the trial court for vacating if not for any modification of the interim ex parte order passed Second is that an appeal could have been preferred by him against the said order Section of the Code says that an appeal shall lie from the following orders and save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any law for the time being in force from no other orders i any order made under rules from which an appeal is expressly allowed by rules Order Rule says that An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of Section namely An order under Rule Rule Rule A Rule or Rule of Order Where in any suit it is proved by affidavit or otherwise a that any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted damaged or alienated by any party to the suit or wrongfully sold in execution of a decree or that the defendant threatens or intends to remove or dispose of his property with a view to defrauding his creditors that the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiff or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit the <ORG> may by order grant a temporary injunction to restrain such act or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing the wasting damaging alienation sale removal or disposition of the property or disposition of the plaintiff or otherwise causing injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit as the <ORG> thinks fit until the disposal of the suit or until further orders It cannot be contended that the power to pass interim ex parte orders of injunction does not emanate from the said Rule The choice is for the party affected by the order either to move the appellate court or to approach the same court which passed the ex parte order for any relief Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents then contended that an order granting injunction without complying with the requisites envisaged in Rule of Order be void Rule reads thus The <ORG> shall in cases except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay before granting an injunction direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party Provided that where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party the Court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay and require the applicant a to deliver to the opposite party or to send to him by registered post immediately after the order granting the injunction has been made a copy of the application for injunction together with i a copy of the affidavit filed in support of the application ii a copy of the plaint and iii copies of documents on which the applicant relies and to file on the day on which such injunction is granted or on the day immediately following that day an affidavit stating that the copies aforesaid have been so delivered or sent What would be the position if a court which passed the order granting interim ex parte injunction did not record reasons thereof or did not require the applicant to perform the duties enumerated in clauses a of Rule of Order In our view such an Order can be deemed to contain such requirements at least by implication even if they are not stated in so many words But if a party in whose favour an order was passed ex parte fails to comply with the duties which he has to perform as required by the proviso quoted above he must take the risk Non compliance with such requisites on his part cannot be allowed to go without any consequence and to enable him to have only the advantage of it The consequence of the party who secured the order for not complying with the duties he is required to perform is that he cannot be allowed to take advantage of such order if the order is not obeyed by the other party A disobedient beneficiary of an order cannot be heard to complain against any disobedience alleged against another party The said observation is based on the language contained in Order Rule A of the Code which reads thus Where an injunction has been granted without giving notice to the opposite party the <ORG> shall make an endeavour to finally dispose of the application within thirty days from the date on which the injunction was granted and where it is unable so to do it shall record its reasons for such inability The Rule does not say that the period of the injunction order should be restricted by the <ORG> to thirty days at the first instance but the <ORG> should pass final order on it within thirty days from the day on which the injunction was granted Hence the order does not ipso facto become illegal merely because it was not restricted to a period of thirty days or less Nonetheless we have to consider the consequence if any on account of the <ORG> failing to pass the final orders within thirty days as enjoined by Rule A First is the legal obligation that the <ORG> shall make an endeavour to finally dispose of the application of injunction within the period of thirty days Second is the legal obligation that if for any valid reasons the <ORG> could not finally dispose of the application within the aforesaid time the <ORG> has to record the reasons thereof in writing What would happen if a <ORG> does not do either of the courses We have to bear in mind that in such a case the <ORG> would have by passed the three protective humps which the legislature has provided for the safety of the person against whom the order was passed without affording him an opportunity to have a say in the matter If that hump is also bypassed by the <ORG> it is difficult to hold that the party affected by the order should necessarily be the sole sufferer It is the acknowledged position of law that no party can be forced to suffer for the inaction of the court or its omissions to act according to the procedure established by law Under the normal circumstances the aggrieved party can prefer an appeal only against an order passed under Rules A or of Order of the Code in terms of Order Rule of the Code He cannot approach the appellate or revisional court during the pendency of the application for grant or vacation of temporary injunction In such circumstances the party who does not get justice due to the inaction of the court in following the mandate of law must have a remedy So we are of the view that in a case where the mandate of Order Rule A of the Code is flouted the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the right of appeal notwithstanding the pendency of the application for grant or vacation of a temporary injunction against the order remaining in force In such appeal if preferred the appellate court shall be obliged to entertain the appeal and further to take note of the omission of the subordinate court in complying with the provisions of Rule A In appropriate cases the appellate court apart from granting or vacating or modifying the order of such injunction may suggest suitable action against the erring judicial officer including recommendation to take steps for making adverse entry in his ACRs Failure to decide the application or vacate the ex parte temporary injunction shall for the purposes of the appeal be deemed to be the final order passed on the application for temporary injunction on the date of expiry of thirty days mentioned in the Rule Now what remains is the question whether <ORG> should have entertained the petition under Article of the Constitution when the party had two other alternative remedies Learned single judge need not have entertained the revision petition at all and the party affected by the interim ex parte order should have been directed to resort to one of the other remedies In the light of the direction issued by <ORG> that the trial court should pass final orders on the interlocutory application filed by the plaintiff on merits and in accordance with law we may further add that till such orders are passed by the trial court status quo as it prevailed immediately preceding the institution of the suit would be maintained by the parties
