There is also provision in the scheme for conversion of the Certificate into a paid up Certificate the paid up amount to be paid at the end of the period but without bonus Section of <ORG> of India Act empowers <ORG> to collect information from <ORG> as to deposits and to give directions in the public interest in particular in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits including the rates of interest payable on such deposits and the periods for which deposits may be received Paragraph enabled <ORG> to exempt any company or class of companies from all or any of the provisions of the directions either generally or for a specified period if it considered necessary for avoiding any hardship or for any other just and sufficient reason Paragraph also vasted in <ORG> the power to grant exemption in suitable cases Thereafter in the Prize Chits and Money Circula tion Schemes Banning Act was enacted to ban the promotion or conduct of prize chits and money circulations schemes and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto There is no general provision which empowers <ORG> or <ORG> of India to exempt any other prize chit or money circulation scheme from the applicabili ty of the Act On March <ORG> informed the <ORG> <ORG> that under the Miscellaneous Non Banking Companies Directions which applied to the <ORG> the <ORG> was prohibited from accepting deposits for more than months and since the deposits accepted by the <ORG> were for periods exceeding months <ORG> wanted to know what action the <ORG> proposed to take to comply with the requirement stipulating the maximum period for which depos its might be accepted In reply the <ORG> by its letter dated st March pointed out the special features of the <ORG> which persuaded <ORG> to grant exemp tion to the <ORG> from the directions By its letter dated July <ORG> pointed out to the company that the schemes conducted by the <ORG> were covered by the provisions of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act which had come into force with effect from December As the <ORG> was banned from doing fresh business and was required to wind up its existing business under the Act there was no question of granting any exemption to the company The company has filed another writ petition in <ORG> against the said refusal by the <ORG> to grant exemption A Interpretation must depend on the text and the context One may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual With this knowledge the statute must be read first as a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place There is no need to introduce the word or either There is nothing in the text which makes it imperative that it be read otherwise It may be true that <ORG> is paying higher bonus year after year but the bonus comes out of the amounts of the forfeited policies and it means that it is really the poor class of policy holders whose policies are forfeited that are paying bonus to the class of policy holders who are better off which requires the <ORG> to secure that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment The Judgments of the Court were delivered following <NAME> <NAME> I agree with my learned brother in his con clusion When I say this I feel concerned of those situated far and wide in the remote villages of the country uninitiated into the mysteries of financial schemes who are lured by the prom ises of easy money and decide to pay the first instalment by the encouraging words of the agents who forget them there after because of the disincentive commission they get after the first instalment is paid who therefore do not pursue these depositors to make subsequent deposits promptly But its activities in certain spheres were brought to our notice by the learned counsel for the appellants I fully agree with the observations made by my learned brother regarding some of the aspects of the <ORG> schemes There is no element of uncertainty in the matter the terms and conditions of the Certificate are simple liberal and attractive No trouble of Medical Examination Unique advantage of saving as well as earning decent profit etc This gives us an indication as to the class of depositors who are principally contacted and are perhaps intended to be so contacted At this point we may refer to one of the schemes market ed by <ORG> which appears to be familiarly known in circles connected with deposit schemes as Table No Policy For a better appreciation of the submissions which we will consider at a later stage we desire to set out the details of the Policy at this juncture itself in order to compare it with the Endowment Scheme of the Peerless Compa ny Now under this Policy if payment of the annual premium ceases after at least three years premiums have been paid a free paid up Policy for an amount bearing the same proportion to the sum assured as the number of premiums actually paid bears to the total number stipulated in the Policy will be automati cally secured Since it is the poorer class of Policy holders that may ordinarily be expected to commit default in payment of premiums the forfeiture clause in practice operates harshly specially against that class the very class which requires greater security and protection We are now told daily that <ORG> is paying higher bonus year after year But the learned counsel for <ORG> charges that the bonus comes out of the amounts of the ferfeited policies and that it is really the poorer class of defaulting policy holders whose policies are forfeited that are paying bonus to the class of Policy holders who are better of which requires the <ORG> to secure that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of produc tion to the common detriment Section I defines Financial Institution as follows Financial Institution means any non

instalments over a definite period and that every one of such subscriber shall in his turn as determined by lot or by auction or by tender or in such other manner as may be provided for in the agreement be entitled to the prize amount Explanation For the purposes of this sub para graph the expression prize amount shall mean the amount by whatever name it be called arrived at by deduction from out of the total amount subscribed at each instalment by all subscribers a the commission charged by the company as service charges as a promot er or a foreman or an agent and any sum which a subscriber agrees to forego from out of the total subscriptions of each instalment in consideration of the balance being paid to him Paragraph enabled <ORG> to exempt any company or class of companies from all or any of the provisions of the directions either generally or for a specified period if it considered neces sary for avoiding any hardship or for any other just and sufficient reason <ORG> issued a circular letter bringing the directions to the notice of companies like <ORG> This is apparent from the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> in <ORG> in Civil Rule No a writ petition filed by <ORG> challenging the refusal of <ORG> to grant them exemption from the Miscellaneous Non <ORG>ing Companies Directions and complaining of discrimination in that such an exemption had been granted to <ORG> Comparing the schemes of the two companies it was pointed out in the affidavit that the Endowment Certificates issued by <ORG> Company were for periods ranging from ten to thirty years while the Endowment Certificates granted by <ORG> ranged from five to thirty years It was granted exemption from the provisions of paragraph of the Directions subject to its compliance with the following conditions What is of impor tance and what requires to be noted here is that <ORG> which had investigated the business of various types of <ORG> was of the view and their view must be taken to have been expressed with reference to those who were well acquainted with the nature of business of <ORG> and those who were incharge of the enforcement of the Directions that the Directions covered companies conducting prize chit schemes benefit or saving schemes or lucky draws as well as companies conduct ing conventional type of chits and other kinds of chits kuris may be allowed a period of three years which may be extended by one more year to wind up their business in respect of such schemes and or switch over to any other type of business permissible under the law If paragraph is read along with paragraph of the Report we must take it that the recommendation of the <ORG> was that prize chits of the kind described by them in paragraph should be banned respective of the name under which they were conducted Paragraph also vested in <ORG> the power to grant exemption in suitable cases The Non Banking Financial Companies Reserve Bank Directions were issued simultaneously with the Miscel laneous NonBanking Companies Reserve Bank Directions and Section i respectively defined the expressions hirepurchase finance company housing finance company insurance company investment company loan company mutual benefit financial company and non banking financial company It was suggested by the learned Counsel for <ORG> that whether <ORG> was a miscellaneous <ORG> within the meaning of the expression as defined in the Miscellaneous Non Banking Companies Reserve Bank Directions or a financial institution which was not such a miscellaneous banking company undoubtedly there was a ceiling or the maximum period for which the company could accept deposits and that was thirty six months Thereafter in the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act was enacted to ban the promotion or conduct of prize chits and money circulation schemes and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Section defines Money Circula tion Scheme and is as follows money circulation scheme means any scheme by whatever name called for the making of quick or easy money or for the receipt of any money or valuable thing as the consideration for a promise to pay money on any event or contingency relative or applica ble to the enrolment of members into the scheme whether or not such money or thing is derived from the entrance money of the members of such scheme or periodical subscriptions Section defines prize chit and is as follows prize chit includes any transaction or arrangement by whatever name called under which a person collects whether as a promoter foreman agent or in any other capacity monies in one lumpsum or in instalments by way of contributions or subscriptions or by sale of units certificates or other instruments or in any other manner or as membership fees or admission fees or service charges to or in respect of any savings mutual benefit thrift or any other scheme or arrangement by whatever name called and utilises the monies so collected or any part thereof or the income accruing from investment or other use of such monies for all or any of the following pur poses namely i giving or awarding periodically or other wise to a specified number of subscribers as determined by lot draw or in any other man ner prizes or gifts in cash or in kind whether or not the recipient of the prize or gift is under a liability to make any further payment in respect of such scheme or arrange ment ii refunding to the subscribers or such of them as have not won any prize or gift the whole or part of the subscriptions contribu tions or other monies collected with or without any bonus premium interest or other advantage by whatever name called on the termination of the scheme or arrangement or on or after the expiry of the period stipulated therein but does not include a conventional chit The primary question in the present case is whether <ORG> piloted by the <ORG> falls within the definition of prize chit Section bans prize chit and money circulation schemes and is in the following terms No person shall promote or conduct any prize chit or money circulation scheme or enrol as a member to any such chit or scheme or par ticipate in it otherwise or receive or remit any money in pursuance of such chit or scheme Section makes a contravention of the provisions of Section punish able with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or with both Section deals with offences by companies Section deals with the powers of entry search and seizure There is no general provision which empowers <ORG> or <ORG> to exempt any other prize chit or money circulation scheme from the applicability of the Act Section contains transitional provisions relating to the winding up of the business relat ing to a prize chit or money circulation scheme which is being conducted at the commencement of the Act Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act <ORG> has made the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning West Bengal Rules in exercise of its powers under Section of the Act On March <ORG> informed <ORG> that under the Miscellaneous Non Banking Companies Directions which applied to the <ORG> the <ORG> was prohibited from accepting deposits for more than months and since the deposits accepted by the <ORG> were for periods exceeding months <ORG> wanted to know what action the <ORG> proposed to take to comply with the requirement stipulating the maximum period for which depos its might be accepted In reply the <ORG> by its letter dated st March pointed out the special features of the <ORG> which persuade <ORG> to grant exemp tion to the <ORG> from the directions It is not clear what precisely took place subsequently but there was an inspection of <ORG> books by an inspection team appointed by <ORG> of India Thereafter on July <ORG> pur ported to send a reply to the Company letter dated March to which we have made a reference above By this letter <ORG> pointed out to the Company that the schemes conducted by the Company were covered by the provisions of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act which had come into force with effect from December As the Company was banned from doing fresh business and was required to wind up its existing business under the Act there was no question of granting any exemption to the company In the meanwhile on September the <ORG> filed a writ petition in <ORG> for a declaration that the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act did not apply to the business carried on by the company It appears that the <ORG> has filed another writ petition in <ORG> against the refusal of <ORG> to grant exemption We leave that question open as we consider that the appeals preferred by <ORG> <ORG> and the State of West Bengal may be decided without express ing any opinion on the question If there are any vicious features of the business <ORG> he says is ready to remove the vices and cure the defects On the one hand there is a demand for the retributive pound of flesh unmindful of the future of thousands of employees and the fate of the small savings of millions of depositors all in the name of the interest of the depositors In the ultimate analysis the question turns on the interpretation of the definition of Prize Chit in of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act Since there are a large number of prize chits all over the country which have almost become a Pan Indian opidemic and since the total number of people victimised by these projects are considerable the injury to the community is substantial so that a welfare state dedicated to the Directive Principles of Part IV has to awake and protect the vulnerable sector Another weighty factor which has alerted the state into action is that the flood of funds flowing through prize chits benefit the organisers of such schemes who have no social responsibility for national productivity and in their hands is easy money with little developmental benefits or attractive returns for the poor investors We must notice here that in a Conventional Chit as defined in the Act though every subscriber is entitled to the prize amount some get it sooner than the others depending on the result of the auction or the draw and to the extent and it depends on a draw there is a slight element of chance Both sides read out the well known passage in that case where it was stated The word include is very generally used in interpreta tion clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute and when it is so used these words or phrases must be construed as com prehending not only such things as they signify according to their natural import but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include Interpretation must depend on the text and the context One may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour That interpreta tion is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual With this knowledge the statute must be read first as a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statutemaker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place It is by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting of the entire Act and by reference to what preceded the enactment and the reasons for it that the <ORG> con strued the expression Prize Chit in Srinivasa and we find no reason to depart from the <ORG> construction There is no need to introduce the word or either There is nothing in the text which makes it imperative that it be read otherwise We do not agree with this submission However we look at it we arrive at the conclusion that does not contemplate a scheme without a prize and therefore the Endowment Certificate Scheme of <ORG> is outside the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act The appeals filed by <ORG> <ORG> and the State of West Bangal are accordingly dismissed We have explained this earlier and we do wonder whether the weaker sections of the people are not being made to pay the more affluent sections Robbing Peter to pay Paul We would also like to query what action <ORG> and <ORG> are taking or proposing to take against the mushroom growth of finance and investment companies offering staggeringly high rates of interest to depositors leading us to suspect whether these companies are not specu lative ventures floated to attract unwary and credulous investors and capture their savings
