was due as on that date to the plaintiff from the defendant and as such it is submitted that in view of the said admission a decree for this amount be passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties It has further been submitted by the defendants that the said letter has not been signed or written by all the defendants and the balance sheet referred to therein is wrong vague ambiguous and denied and in these circumstances it has been submitted that the application should be dismissed There is nothing to suggest in this letter that any of the defendant has made any admission of the claim of the plaintiff When we consider the defenses raised by the defendant it would be difficult to say that a case has been made out by the plaintiff for passing of a decree for the sum of Rs which lays down as under Where admissions of fact have been made either in the pleading or otherwise whether orally or in writing the court may at any stage of the suit either on the application of any party or of its own motion and without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties make such order or give such judgment as it may think fit having regard to such admissions There is no doubt that Rule of Order has been couched in a very wide language If a case involves questions which cannot be conveniently disposed of or a motion under this rule the court is free to refuse exercising discretion in favor of the party invoking it Where the defendants have raised objections which go to the very root of the case it would not be proper to exercise this discretion and pass a decree in favor of the plaintiff The purpose of Order rule Civil Procedure Code is to avoid waiting by the plaintiff for part of the decree when there is a clear unequivocal unambiguous and unconditional admission of the defendant in respect of the claim of the defendant The rule only secures that if there is no dispute between the parties and if there is on the pleadings or otherwise such an admission as to make it plain that the plaintiff is entitled to a particular order or judgment he should be able to obtain it at once to the extent of admission But the rule is not intended to apply where there are serious questions of law to be asked and determined Air that A judgment on admission under Order rule is a matter of discretion and not a matter of right and the court would not entertain an application for such judgment when the case involves questions which cannot be conveniently dealt with in a motion under the rule In the case in hand not only admission is not unequivocal but further also the defendants have raised certain preliminary pleas which must be decided before the plaintiff can be held to be entitled to a decree The preliminary objections raised by the defendants in this case go to the very root of the suit and are likely to non suit the plaintiff if these were found against the plaintiff and as such I find no merit in this application and this application is liable to be dismissed and is dismissed
