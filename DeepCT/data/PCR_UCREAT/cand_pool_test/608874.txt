It was registered as a dealer under the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act Its products having extensive sales throughout India and abroad were despatched from Calcutta against orders accepted by the appellant company in Calcutta The appellant company denied its liability on the grounds inter alia that it was not resident in Bihar it carried on no business there and none of its sales took place in Bihar There are various provisions in the Act laying down certain conditions which dealers must comply with or submit to They constituted restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed to every citizen of India by Art and further the remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and was indeed useless if the Act providing for such remedy was itself ultra vires and void ii that there is nothing in the Constitution which prevents the <ORG> from departing from a previous decision of its own if the court is satisfied of its error and its baneful effect on the general interests of the public The sales or purchases made by the appellant company which were sought to be taxed by the <ORG> of Bihar actually took place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce the charging section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act read with the relevant definitions cannot operate to tax inter <ORG> sales or purchases and as <ORG> has not otherwise provided the Act in so far as it purports to tax sales or purchases that take place in the course of inter<ORG> trade or commerce is unconstitutional illegal and void The Act imposes tax on subjects divisible in their nature but does not exclude in express terms subjects exempted by the Constitution When in the same context the Explanation declares that a sale in the course of inter <ORG> trade must be deemed to have taken place in the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption its purpose is clearly to take it out of inter <ORG> trade and stamp it with the character of an intrastate sale Each has operation within its own sphere and there is no conflict between them These are simple and familiar expressions used by the legislature when it intends that a particular provision in the Statute should be subject to or override another <ORG> was wrong in holding that there was no warrant for issuing a writ under article of the Constitution on the facts of the case That Article puts an embargo on the power of <ORG> to levy any tax with respect to interState trade or commerce Article puts a fetter on <ORG>s and the Explanation to article a does not confer any power on <ORG> to levy any tax Consequently the appellant which has no office or agent within the State could not be taxed <ORG> has no power to authorise imposition of tax on outside dealers The legislative competence of <ORG> is derived from Article read with the Lists Under article <ORG> is given power to enact legislation with respect to extra territorial operation Bihar cannot tax the sale because it takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce and the State is barred from taxing such sales by reason of clause of article Article read with Entry in List gives the Legislative power whereas article imposes restrictions on such Legislative power of a State There are four restrictions placed by that article the first by clause a the second by clause the third by clause Article gives authority to the <ORG> to watch over the principles underlying article and to see what restrictions are necessary The word sale in Entry means passing of property in the sense of the Sale of Goods Act extra territorial power under the Government of India Act <ORG> did not have such power Article read with Entry of List II is by itself enough to grant legislative competence to the making of laws imposing tax on sales of inter State character having a real and sufficient territorial connection with the taxing State It does not apply to a case where goods are delivered in the purchasing State for purposes other than consumption Article a has no application to cases where the Explanation itself does not apply If article applies to cases covered by article a and the Explanation then it will result in discrimination against local trade in favour of inter state trade and this will be inconsistent with the pro visions of Part XIII of the Constitution If power of taxation is given all ancillary powers are included in that very power The word extra territoriality is used in the sense of legislation with respect to conduct of citizens when they are outside the country Article a like article deals with only sales or purchases which take place during the course of inter State trade or commerce i trade or commerce in which more than one State have interest The words inter State trade or commerce have to be given the widest possible meaning Assuming that <ORG> has jurisdiction to overrule its own decision there is no reason for doing so This appeal filed under a certificate of fitness granted by <ORG> is directed against the judgment of that High Court pronounced on the th December whereby it dismissed the application made by the appellant company under article of the Constitution praying for an appropriate writ or order quashing the proceedings issued by the opposite parties for the purpose of levying and realising a tax which is not lawfully leviable on the petitioners and for other ancillary reliefs The relevant facts appearing from the petition filed in support of the appellant company aforesaid application are as follows The appellant company is an incorporated company carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling various sera vaccines biological Products and medicines Its products have extensive sales throughout <ORG> and abroad This notice was issued under section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act hereinafter called the Act read with rule The reason for issuing this notice as recited therein was that on information which had come to his possession the Superintendent was satisfied that the appellant company was liable to pay tax but had nevertheless wilfully failed to apply for registration under the Act Suffice it to say that while the appellant company denied its liability on the ground inter alia that it was not resident in Bihar it carried on no business there none of its sales took place in Bihar and that it did not collect any sales tax from any person of that State the Bihar Sales Tax authorities maintained that under section which was substantially based on article of the Constitution and was inserted in the Act by the President Adaptation Order promulgated on the th April all sales in West Bengal or any other State under which the goods had been delivered in the State of Bihar as a direct result of the sale for the purpose of consumption in that State were liable to Bihar Sales Tax <ORG> dismissed the petition on the th December but on the next day issued a certificate under article of the Constitution that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution petition was raised by the respondents as a preliminary objection and it was answered in their favour by <ORG> It pointed out that it was not a case for the Sales Tax Officer usurping a jurisdiction not vested in him by law or acting in excess of his jurisdiction or acting mala fide <ORG> took the view that the Act undoubtedly conferred jurisdiction on the Sales Tax Officer to investigate the question of liability of a dealer to Sales Tax under the Act and accordingly he was acting well within his jurisdiction in issuing the impugned notice In reaching that conclusion <ORG> appears to have overlooked the fact that the main contention of the appellant company as set forth in its petition is that the Act in so far as it purports to tax a nonresident dealer in respect of an inter State sale or purchase of goods is ultra vires the Constitution and wholly illegal In the impugned Act there are various provisions laying down conditions which dealers must comply with or submit to namely to give only a few instances compulsory registration of dealers Section filing of returns Section attendance and production of evidence in support of the return Section production inspection and seizure of books of account or documents and search of premises Section Section prescribes penalties for contravention of the provisions of the Act These and other like provisions in the Act undoubtedly constitute restrictions on the fundamental right to carry on business which is guaranteed to every citizen of India by article of the Constitution It is urged that the appellant being a company is not a citizen and cannot therefore claim any fundamental right under article which is available only to citizens and therefore the decisions of this Court referred to above have no application It has been argued that the application was premature for there has so far been no investigation or finding on facts and no assessment under section of the Act In the first place it ignores the plain fact that this notice calling upon the appellant company to forthwith get itself registered as a dealer and to submit a return and to deposit the tax in a treasury in Bihar places upon it considerable hardship harassment and liability which if the Act is void under article read with article constitute in present an encroachment on and an infringement of its right which entitles it to immediately appeal to the appropriate Court for redress It is therefore not reasonable to expect the person served with such an order or notice to ignore it on the ground that it is illegal for he can only do so at his own risk and peril This Court has said in the last mentioned case that a person placed in such a situation has the right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly where he stands and what he may or may not do Another plea advanced by the respondent <ORG> is that the appellant company is not entitled to take proceedings praying for the issue of prerogative writs under article as it has adequate alternative remedy under the impugned Act by way of appeal or revision The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is indeed nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can therefore have no application where a party comes to Court with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article We are therefore Of the opinion for reasons stated above that <ORG> as not right in holding that the petition under article was misconceived or was not maintainable Coming then to the merits of the petition the principal question is whether the tax threatened to be levied on the sales made by the appellant company and implemented by delivery in the circumstances and manner mentioned in its petition is leviable by the State of Bihar The legal capacity of the State of Bihar to tax these sales is questioned on the following grounds namely A that the sales sought to be taxed having taken place in the course of inter State trade or commerce and <ORG> not having by law provided otherwise all States are debarred from imposing tax on such sales by reason of article that even if the ban under article did not apply the State of Bihar is not competent to impose tax on such sales on a correct reading of article read with Entry of List II in the Seventh Schedule and article that the Bihar Sales Tax Act can have no extra territorial operation and cannot therefore impose tax on such sales by a non resident seller that on a true construction of the Act itself it does not apply to the sales sought to be taxed It raises a question of construction of article of the Constitution In the judgment under appeal <ORG> took the view that sales or purchases in the course of inter State trade or commerce referred to in article must be construed so as to exclude the particular Class of sales or purchases described in the Explanation to clause a of article and that therefore the provisions of the Bihar Sales Tax Act in so far as they purported to impose tax on such sales were not in conflict with article as so construed the majority of that Bench held that article a read with the Explanation thereto and construed in the light of articles and prohibited the taxation of sales or purchases involving inter State elements by all States except the State in which the goods were actually delivered for the purpose of consumption therein and that clause of article did not affect the power of the State in which delivery of the goods was so made to tax the sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in the Explanation the effect of which was to convert such inter State transactions into intrastate transactions and to take them out of the operation of clause of that article The only exceptions to this rule are the <ORG> is entitled and bound to decide which of the two conflicting decisions of its own it will follow the <ORG> is bound to refuse to follow a decision of its own which though not expressly overruled cannot in its opinion stand with a decision of <ORG> and the <ORG> is not bound to follow a decision of its own if it is satisfied that the decision was given per incuriam where a Statute or a rule having statutory effect which would have affected the decision was not brought to the attention of the earlier <ORG> Changes in the number of appointed Justices can I take it never of themselves furnish a reason for review In State of Washington <ORG> <ORG> in his dissenting judgment said The doctrine Of stare decision should not deter us from overruling that case and those which follow it In considering the applicability of the principles laid down in the decisions here in before mentioned it should be borne in mind that the English decisions may well have been influenced by considerations which can no longer apply to the circumstances prevailing in India There is nothing in our Constitution which prevents us from departing from a previous decision if we are convinced of its error and its baneful effect on the general interests of the public <NAME> has now in the judgment he has written in the present appeal which we have had the advantage of reading reconsidered the matter and on further reflection he thinks that the majority decision on the present issue was erroneous and he now agrees substantially with the view of article a read with the Explanation and article which was expressed in the two minority judgments referred to above and which is adopted in the judgment now being delivered in the present appeal Its effect is far reaching as it affects the rights of all consuming public It involves an adjudication on the taxing power of the <ORG>s as against the consuming public generally Reference is made to the doctrine of finality of judicial decisions and it is pressed upon us that we should not reverse our previous decision except in cases where a material provision of law has been overlooked or where the decision has proceeded upon the mistaken assumption of the continuance of a repealed or expired statute and that we should not differ from a previous decision merely because a contrary view appears to us to be preferable Our power of review which undoubtedly exists must be exercised with due care and caution and only for advancing the public well being in the light of the surrounding circumstances of each case brought to our notice but we do not consider it right to confine our power within rigidly fixed limits as suggested before us If on a re examination of the question we come to the conclusion as indeed we have that the previous majority decision was plainly erroneous then it will be our duty to say so and not to perpetuate our mistake even when one learned Judge who was party to the previous decision considers it incorrect on further reflection Further the doctrine of stare decisis has hardly any application to an isolated and stray decision of the <ORG> very recently made and not followed by a series of decisions based thereon In any case the doctrine of stare decisis is not an inflexible rule of law and cannot be permitted to perpetuate our errors to the detriment to the general welfare of the public or a considerable section thereof It is pointed out that all the States are realising sales tax in respect of sales or purchases of goods where the goods are actually delivered for consumption within their respective boundaries on the faith of our previous decision and a reversal of that decision will upset the economy of the States and will indeed render them liable to refund moneys already collected by them as taxes Finally if the State economy is upset the appeal must be to <ORG> which under article itself has ample power to make suitable legislation One of the four Judges who formed the majority has revised his opinion as stated above It has given rise to considerable inconvenience and hardship to business people who have not acquiesced in it by any means supra is in the circumstances alluded to open to review and we are entitled to re examine article in order to ascertain its true meaning scope and effect so far as it is necessary for the purposes of this appeal and we proceed on this basis The true reason of the remedy and then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief and pro privato commodo and to add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act pro bono publico In <ORG> Comptroller General of Patents Designs and Trade Marks Earl of Halsbury re affirmed the rule as follows My Lords it appears to me that to construe the Statute in question it is not only legitimate but highly convenient to refer both to the former Act and to the ascertained evils to which the former Act had given rise and to the later Act which provided the remedy These three being compared I cannot doubt the conclusion In order to properly interpret the provisions of that article it is therefore necessary to consider how the matter stood immediately before the Constitution came into force what the mischief was for which the old law did not provide and the remedy which has been provided by the Constitution to cure that mischief After expressing the view based on the authority of the Walk Brothers Case that in the case of sales tax it was not necessary that the sale should take place within the territorial limits of the <ORG> in the sense that all the ingredients of a sale like the agree Ch should have a territorial connection with the State and that broadly speaking local activities of buying and selling carried on in the State in relation to local goods would be a sufficient basis to sustain the taxing power of the State provided of course that such activities ultimately resulted in a concluded sale to be taxed the learned Chief Justice proceeded to say In exercise of the legislative power conferred upon them in substantially similar terms by the Government of India Act the Provincial Legislatures enacted Sales Tax laws for their respective Provinces acting on the principle of territorial nexus referred to above that is to say they picked out one or more of the ingredients constituting a sale and made them the basis of their sales tax legislation No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the State or in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India For the purposes of sub clause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State Except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce Provided that the President may by order direct that any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any St ate immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause continue to be levied until the thirty first day of March No law made by the Legislature of a State imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent it is one of the several articles which are grouped under the heading Miscellaneous Financial Provisions in Chapter I of that Part It is to be noted that it has not found a place in Part XI Chapter I whereof deals with Legislative Relations including Distribution of Legislative Powers between <ORG> and the <ORG>s of <ORG>s It will be recalled that section of the Government of India Act read with Entry of List of the Seventh Schedule to that Act gave power to the Provincial <ORG>s to make laws with respect to Taxes on sale of goods and on advertisements Therefore while the Constitution makers by article read with Entry in List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution conferred power on the <ORG>s of Part A and Part <ORG>s to make law with respect to Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers they at the same time by article clamped on that legislative power several fetters Broadly speaking the fetters thus placed on the taxing power of the <ORG>s are that no law of a <ORG> shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the <ORG> or in the course of import or export or except in so far as <ORG> otherwise provides in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce and lastly that no law made by the <ORG> of a <ORG> imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent In order to make the ban effective and to leave no loophole the Constitution makers have considered the different aspects of sales or purchases of goods and placed checks on the legislative power of the <ORG>s at different angles Thus in clause a of article the question of the situs of a sale or purchase engaged their attention and they forged a fetter on the basis of such situs to cure the mischief of multiple taxation by the <ORG>s on the basis of the nexus theory A law made by West Bengal without the assent of the president taxing this sale will be unconstitutional because it will offend article a as the sale has taken place outside the territory by virtue of the Explanation to clause a it will also offend article as the sale has taken place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce Although the <ORG>s of the <ORG>s were empowered by article read with Entry of List II to make a law with respect to taxes on sales or purchases of goods the different <ORG> <ORG>s as already mentioned considered themselves free to make a law imposing tax on sales or purchases of goods provided they bad some territorial nexus with such sales or purchases that one or other of the ingredients or events which go to make up a sale or purchase was found to exist or had happened within their respective territories The first thing that they did was to take away the <ORG>s taxing power with respect to sales or purchases which took place outside their respective territories If the matter had been left there the solution would have been imperfect for then the question as to which sale or purchase takes place outside a <ORG> would yet have remained open The language employed in framing the Explanation how ever has given scope for argument to counsel and presented considerable difficulties to the <ORG> in ascertaining its purpose and intendment If the Explanation simply said For the purposes of subclause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place outside a <ORG> when the goods have actually been delivered for the purpose of consumption in another <ORG> notwithstanding the fact etc In the view we have taken it is not necessary for us to express any final opinion in the matter We propose accordingly to note the possible views and record very briefly the criticisms relating to each of those views and the suggested answers to such criticisms In clause a the Constitution makers have placed a ban on the taxing power of the <ORG>s with respect to sales or purchases which take place outside the <ORG> If the matter had been left there the ban would have been imperfect for the argument would have still remained as to where a particular sale or purchase took place Does a sale or purchase take place at the place where the contract of sale is made or where the property in the goods passes or where the goods are delivered These questions are answered by the Explanation By saying that a particular sale or purchase is to be deemed to take place in a particular <ORG> the Explanation only indicates that such sale or purchase has taken place outside all other <ORG>s The Explanation is neither an Exception nor a Proviso but only explains what is an outside sale referred to in sub clause a Further it is utterly illogical and untenable to say that article which was introduced in the Constitution to place restrictions on the legislative powers of the <ORG>s by aside wind as it were gave enlarged legislative powers to the <ORG> of delivery by an explanation sandwiched between two restrictions Its only purpose is to explain what an outside sale is so that by one stroke as it were it takes away the taxing power in respect of sales or purchases of the kind referred to in the Explanation of all <ORG>s other than the <ORG> where such sales or purchases are by the Explanation to be deemed to have taken place Suppose it is said <ORG> lifts the ban placed on inter State trade or commerce by clause all States will in that situation claim the right to tax sales or purchases if any one of the ingredients or events making up the sale is to be found to exist or to have happened in that State The ban under clause being lifted the delivery State will become free to tax such sales or purchases in exercise of the taxing power conferred on it by article read with Entry in List II Then it is asked what will happen to those sales or purchases which do not fall within the Explanation After <ORG> lifts the ban under clause which State will tax sales or purchases in which goods are actually delivered in a particular State not for consumption in that State but say for re export to another State for consump tion One of the suggested answers was that those sales or purchases were not likely to be numerous for ordinarily a dealer would not actually get the goods imported into a State only for re exporting the same to another State for consumption in the last mentioned State but would find it more convenient and economical to arrange for the delivery of the goods straight to the last mentioned State This suggested answer in its turn raises a question as to the scope and ambit of the legislative power conferred on <ORG> by clause The opening words of clause namely Except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide clearly indicate that the lifting of the ban may be total or partial that is to say <ORG> may lift the ban wholly and unconditionally or it may lift it to such extent as it may think fit to do and on such terms as it pleases It is therefore conceded that in exercise of its legislative powers under that entry read with article <ORG> may make a law permitting the States to tax interState sales or purchases of certain commodities only It is also not questioned that <ORG> may by way of regulating inter State trade or commerce fix a ceiling rate of tax on sales or purchases of goods which the law made by the States under Entry of List II may not exceed The majority decision quite clearly concedes that the Explanation does not by itself confer any legislative power on any <ORG> not even the delivery <ORG> with respect to sales or purchases of the kind mentioned therein but as it fixes the situs of such sales or purchases in the delivery <ORG> that <ORG> is left free to tax them in exercise of its legislative powers under article read with Entry of List In the next place this view ignores the existence of clause which imposes a different ban on the legislative power of all <ORG>s including the delivery <ORG> also so that as long as <ORG> does not lift the ban no <ORG> not even the delivery <ORG> may tax sales or purchases which take place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce even though they may fall within the Explanation That as we have said will call for decision if and when <ORG> exercises its legislative powers under clause supra is that the Explanation concerns itself with notionally fixing the situs of sales or purchases in the delivery State only but in no way affects the taxing power of the State in which under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods has passed The result of this view is said to be that the State in which the sales or purchases are to be deemed to have taken place may tax them but the State in which under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods has passed may also tax them if and when <ORG> lifts the ban of clause that if clause a and the Explanation are limited in their operation only to the two <ORG>s men tioned above then the other States which also claimed to tax on the strength of the nexus theory the State where the contract was made or the State where the goods were produced or manufactured or were found will be outside the ban and the mischief of multiple taxation which the Constitution makers were out to curb will continue to be rampant and unabated This view is also subjected to some of the other criticisms mentioned in connection with the other views of the Explanation Legal fictions are created only for some definite purpose If therefore the Explanation cannot be read into clause because of the express language of the Explanation and also because of the difference in the subject matter of the operative provisions of the two clauses then it must follow that except in so far as <ORG> may by law provide otherwise no State law can impose or authorise the imposition of any tax on sales or purchases when such sales or purchases take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce and irrespective of whether such sales or purchases do or do not fall within the Explanation It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to enter upon a discussion as to what is exactly meant by inter State trade or commerce or by the phrase in the course of for it is common ground that the sales or purchases made by the appellant company which are sought to be taxed by the State of Bihar actually took place in the course of inter State trade or commerce They nevertheless came to the conclu sion that when once it was determined with the aid of the fictional test that a particular sale or purchase had taken place within the taxing <ORG> it followed as a corollary that the transaction lost its inter <ORG> character and fell outside the purview of clause not because the fiction created by the Explanation was used for the purpose of clause but because such sale or purchase became in the eye of the law a purely local transaction The argument which leads to this astounding conclusion has only to be stated to be rejected We find no cogent reason in support of the argument that a fiction created for certain definitely expressed purposes namely the purposes of clause a can legitimately be used for the entirely foreign and collateral purpose of destroying the inter <ORG> character of the transaction and converting it into an intra<ORG> sale or purchase Now even when the <ORG> of a sale or purchase is in fact inside a <ORG> with no essential ingredient taking place outside nevertheless if it takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce it will be hit by clause If the sales or purchases are in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce the stream of inter <ORG> trade or commerce will catch up in its vortex all such sales or purchases which take place in its course wherever the <ORG> of the sales or purchases may be It does not lift the sales or purchases out of the stream in those cases where they form part of the stream It has yet to be ascertained whether that sale or purchase which by virtue of the Explanation has taken place in the delivery <ORG> was made in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce Nothing that we have heard on the present occasion induces us to depart from the views expressed on this subject in those dissenting judgments It appears to us that this argument overlooks the basic fact that clause a to which is appended the Explanation and clause deal with different topics altogether It is true that the Explanation may apply to fix the Situs Of many inter State transactions but that is only for ascertaining for the purposes of clause a whether it has taken place in side or outside a particular State It is said that we must construe article as a whole and give meaning to every part of it Apart from that there are obvious fallacies which render the argument utterly unacceptable It has no present application and its usefulness will ensue only when <ORG> by law declares certain goods to be essential for the life of the community The buyer and the seller enter into a contract at Gurgaon for the sale of certain goods and a term of the contract is that the goods contracted to be sold will be actually delivered from the seller godown to the buyer retail shop both in the State of Delhi for consumption in the State of Delhi It may well be argued that there was scope for the operation of clause a and the Explanation as and when the President exercised the powers vested in him by the Proviso to clause Therefore the proviso authorised the President by order to continue only such of them as were being lawfully levied and consequently there is no reason to think that the President order was intended to continue all sales taxes previously levied irrespective of their legality In the next place there is nothing to be surprised at if the President order was made to operate subject to the prohibition of clause a read with the Explanation To give effect to this argument we shall have to alter the non obstante clause towards the end of the proviso and substitute the words of the foregoing clauses for the words of this clause Whether the delivery State will be entitled to make a law imposing tax on such sales or purchases in exercise of the legislative powers vested in it by article read with Entry in List II or whether <ORG> while lifting the ban may also by the same law authorise the delivery State to do so or what is the extent of the authority vested in <ORG> by the opening words of clause are questions which will arise for consideration only after the ban under clause is lifted and we need not in advance express any opinion on a future problem iv If we accept the argument that we are to give full effect to clause a and the Explanation and let it operate immediately on all transactions which come within their terms and leave clause to govern only those cases which are outside clause a read with the Explanation then on a parity of reasoning we shall have to give effect to clause a and the Explanation and leave clause and also clause to govern only those cases which do not fall within clause a read with the Explanation Suppose there is a sale of such essential goods by a seller in the State of Delhi to a buyer in Gurgaon in the State of Punjab in which as a direct result of such sale the goods are delivered in Gurgaon in Punjab for consumption in that State According to the argument we have to give full effect first to clause a and the Explanation and accordingly we must hold that the transaction is wholly covered by the Explanation and therefore Punjab will be entitled to tax it and clause must be left to govern only cases other than those which fall within the Explanation It may well say that the restrictive requirements of reserving the bill for the President assent and of obtaining such assent before the law may take effect apply only to a law which imposes tax on sales or purchases which are outside the Explanation In other words the State of Punjab in our illustration will be entitled to say that clause governs only those cases of sales or purchases of essential goods which do not come within the description mentioned in the Explanation namely for instance only those sales or purchases in which es sential goods are delivered in a State not for consumption in that State but for re export to another State An argument which leads us to a result so utterly absurd and untenable in reason cannot for a moment be countenanced No less than five reasons have been suggested in support of the argument that a restricted construction should be placed on clause of article a In the first place it is urged that clause should be construed in a restricted way because the class of sales falling within article a forms a special class of inter State sales and they cannot be affected by the general provisions of article The second reason urged is that if article applies to the class of sales or purchases falling within article a then it will result in discrimination against local trade and in favour of interState trade and this will be inconsistent with the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution The argument is that as a literal construction of clause will result in such discrimination against local trade the cardinal rule of interpretation namely reading the written provision literally and giving to the words their ordinary natural meaning should give way to a restricted con struction If there is any real hardship of the kind referred to there is <ORG> which is expressly invested with the power of lifting the ban under clause either wholly or to the extent it thinks fit to do Further the argument overlooks the fact that the so called hardship if any is brought about not really by reason of the liberal construction of clause but by reason of the State of Bihar imposing a sales tax on an intrastate transaction The State of Bihar is not obliged to levy a sales tax on sales or purchases of goods in respect of which there is competition between out of State producers manufacturers and dealers and the Bihar producers manufacturers and dealers and indeed if it intends to encourage its local manufacturers or producers it should not do so The dealer in the consuming State in his turn sells the goods in retail to actual consumers There can be no objection to insisting upon all inside dealers getting them selves registered and submitting returns showing goods imported and sold by them and bringing their annual turnovers to tax which they will pass on to the actual consumers Call it a purchase tax vis a vis the earlier transaction under which the goods were delivered in Bihar for consumption in that State or call it a sales tax vis a vis the subsequent local sales by the Bihar dealer to actual consumers in Bihar the State will get the full revenue on these local sales or purchases from the local sellers If big Bihar purchasers <ORG> who are very heavy consumers of coal prefer to get their supply of coal from Ranigunge coal fields in West Bengal for consumption in their large factories at Tatanagar in Bihar to getting their supplies from the Jharia coal fields in Bihar and thereby evade sales tax to the detriment of the revenues of the State of Bihar then again there is <ORG> to mitigate such hardship by making suitable laws in exercise of its power under article therefore imposed several bans on the taxing power of the States with respect to sales or purchases namely first on the basis of their situs secondly and thirdly on the basis of the character of the transactions foreign trade or inter State trade and fourthly on the basis of the nature or quality of the goods sold or purchased i whether they have been declared to be essential to the life of the community Anybody who has any practical experience of the working of the sales tax laws of the different States knows how long books are detained by the officers of each State during assessment proceedings There are different stages of these proceedings original appellate and revisional and there will be as many proceedings under each heading as there are States where the goods are sold The period we are concerned with in this appeal is from th January to the th September with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration including a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge Provided that a transfer of goods on hire purchase or other installment system of payment shall notwithstanding the fact that the seller retains a title to any goods as security for payment of the price be deemed to be a sale Provided further that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act III of the sale of any goods i which are actually in Bihar at the time when in respect thereof the contract of sale as defined in section of that Act is made or ii which are produced or manufactured in Bihar by the producer or manufacturer thereof shall wherever the delivery or contract of sale is made be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have taken place in Bihar Provided further that the sale of goods in respect of a forward contract whether goods under such contract are actually delivered or not shall be deemed to have taken place on the date originally agreed upon for delivery This definition was amended and between the st April and the st March which covers the latter part of the relevant period it read as follows sale means with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration including a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge Provided that a transfer of goods on hire purchase or other installment system of payment shall notwithstanding the fact that the seller retains a title to any goods as security for payment of the price be deemed to be a sale Provided further that the sale of goods in respect of a forward contract whether goods under such contract are actually delivered or not shall be deemed to have taken place on the date originally agreed upon for delivery Explanation The sale of any goods actually delivered in Bihar as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in Bihar shall be deemed for the purpose of this Act to have taken place in Bihar notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale passed in another State The charging section is section which provides amongst other things that subject to the provisions of sections and and with effect from the commencement of the Act every dealer whose gross turn over during the year immediately preceding the date of such commencement on sales which have taken place both in and outside Bihar exceeds Rs shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on sales which have taken place in Bihar and from the date of such commencement There are various provisions for working out the scheme of the Act to which no detailed reference need be made In view of the interpretation we have put upon article it must follow that the charging section of the Act read with the relevant definitions cannot operate to tax inter State sales or purchases and it must be held that as <ORG> has not otherwise provided the Act in so far as it purports to tax sales or purchases that take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce is unconstitutional illegal and void This being the position the question arises whether the Act is bad In toto or is bad only in so far as it offends the provisions of article as construed above It appears to us that the Act imposes tax on subjects divisible in their nature but does not exclude in express terms subjects exempted by the Constitution There is no reason to presume that had <ORG> known that the provisions of the Act might be held bad in so far as they imposed or authorised the imposition of a tax on inter State trade or commerce even though <ORG> had not by law provided otherwise it would nevertheless not have passed the rest of the Act The result therefore is that this appeal must be allowed and we issue an order directing that until <ORG> by law provides otherwise the <ORG> of Bihar do forbear and abstain from imposing sales tax on out of <ORG> dealers in respect of sales or purchases that have taken place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce even though the goods have been delivered as a direct result of such sales or purchases for consumption in Bihar The <ORG> must pay the costs of the appellant in this Court and in the Court below The <ORG> is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act having its registered office at No Dharamtala Street Calcutta and laboratory and factory at Baranagar in the District of Parganas in West Bengal and carrying on business of manufacturing and selling various sera vaccines biological products and medicines etc The <ORG> has extensive sales of its products throughout the whole of <ORG> and the goods are despatched by the <ORG> from Calcutta by rail steamer or air against orders accepted at Calcutta and all sales take place within the State of West Bengal The <ORG> denied the right of the State of Bihar to tax the sales effected in West Bengal and by his letter dated the th December the Superintendent of <ORG> Central Circle Bihar sent a notice under section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act to the <ORG> calling upon it to apply for registration and to submit the return showing its turn over for the period from the th January to the th September The Appellant thereupon by its letter dated the th June called upon the Superintendent of <ORG> Central Circle Bihar to forthwith rescind and cancel the notice issued under section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act as the said notice was ultra vires of the Constitution and also the Bihar Sales Tax Act and was entirely illegal and inoperative As the aforesaid demand was not complied with the Appellant filed in <ORG> at Patna a petition under article of the Constitution asking for appropriate reliefs by way of issue of a writ of mandamus certiorari and prohibition and any other appropriate writs or orders quashing the proceedings issued for the purpose of levying and realising a tax which was not lawfully leviable on the Appellant and asking the Appellant to file a return and register itself as a dealer <ORG> held That the Respondent was acting within his jurisdiction in issuing the notice under section and holding that the applicant was liable to pay the tax that if he made an assessment under section the Act provided a right of appeal whereby any error of law might be corrected by the Appellate authorities prescribed under the Act that sections and of the Act furnished a complete and effec tive machinery for appeal and revision against assessments made under the Act and that there was therefore no warrant for issuing a writ under article of the Constitution That the phrase sale or purchase in the course of inter State trade or commerce in article must be construed so as to exclude the particular class of sales or purchases described in the explanation to article and that therefore the amended clauses and of section and section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act were not in conflict with article That the Bihar Sales Tax Act was in pith and substance not a law with respect to sale of goods but a law imposing tax on the sale of goods and the legislation fell entirely within Item of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution viz taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers and that the Act could not therefore be said to be invalid under article That the Bihar Sales Tax Act had been enacted for the purpose of imposing tax on the sale of goods and not for regulating inter State or intrastate trade and commerce and that therefore the Act did not contravene in any way article and That the Act was also not invalid on the ground that it was extra territorial in operation that the jurisdiction to tax existed not only in regard to persons or property but also as regards the business done within the State that it was not necessary for the purposes of jurisdiction that the entire transaction of sale should have taken place within the territories that on the other hand the fact that the goods were delivered in Bihar for consumption constituted sufficient nexus or territorial connection which conferred jurisdiction upon the Bihar legislature to impose the tax and that the explanation to article a expressly conferred upon the State power to tax sales or purchases of goods which were actually delivered for consumption inside the State It is plain that the <ORG> evinced an intention that it could certainly proceed to apply the penal provisions of the Act against the appellant if it failed to make the return or to meet the demand These observations have apposite application to the circumstances of the present case Explanation to section of the Act having been declared ultra vires any imposition of sales tax on the appellant in Madhya Pradesh is without the authority of law and that being so a threat by the State by using the coercive machinery of the Impugned Act to realize it from the appellant is a sufficient infringement of his fundamental right under article and it was clearly entitled to relief under article of the Constitution There it was held that the principle that a court will not issue a prerogative writ when an adequate alternative remedy was available could not apply where a party came to the court with an allegation that his fundamental right had been infringed and sought relief under article Before the appellant can avail of it he has to deposit the whole amount of the tax Such a provision can hardly be described as an adequate alternative remedy This sufficiently disposes of that contention and I am of the opinion that <ORG> was in error when it held that there was no warrant for issuing a writ On the merits <NAME> appearing for the appellant urged That article put a fetter on <ORG> and the explanation did not confer any power on any <ORG> to levy any taxes but was meant to explain only clause a i what was an outside sale or purchase and that it did not remove any restrictions or fetters and did not convert any inter State sale or purchase into an intrastate or local or domestic transaction That article in Part XII was meant to implement the supremacy of <ORG> with regard to inter State trade or commerce and it put an embargo on the power of <ORG> to levy any tax on sale or purchase with respect to interState trade or commerce and that it was only when the embargo was lifted by appropriate <ORG>ary legislation that <ORG> could levy any tax on sales or purchases in the course of inter State trade or commerce and That legislative competence of a <ORG> was derived from article read with the lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution that under article only <ORG> was given the power to enact legislation with extra territorial operation and the <ORG>s had no such power and that the combined effect of article and article read with Item of List II was that the <ORG> was only competent to make laws imposing tax on sale or purchase of goods for the whole or part of that State No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the State or in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India For the purposes of sub clause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State not withstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State Except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce Provided that the President may by order direct that any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall They are enacted in Part XII of the Constitution which relates to finance property contracts and suits and fall under the caption of Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Their main purpose is to lay down the restrictions on <ORG> Legislatures to enact laws imposing or authorising the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods Article lays down such restrictions where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the <ORG> or in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India Article lays down such restrictions where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce Except for these special dispensations the restrictions laid down by article and prevail and the true scope and extent of these restrictions would have to be culled out of the terms in which these provisions are couched The main ground of attack in <ORG> had been that the Act purported to tax sales and purchases of goods regardless of restrictions imposed on the State legislative power by article of the Constitution and in that connection the provisions of article and came to be considered by this Court The majority judgment of this Court delivered by <NAME> <NAME> with which <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> concurred held that article a of the Constitution read with the explanation thereto and con strued in the light of articles and prohibits the taxation of sales or purchases involving interState elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein differed from the view which was taken by me that the Explanation does not deprive the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passed of this taxing power and that consequently both the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passes and the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption This Explanation does not govern clause of article and as it can only apply to transactions which in truth and in fact take place in the course of inter <ORG> trade and commerce there is no need to call it in aid until the ban is removed The did not accept the transfer of ownership in the goods or the passing of property therein as the sole criterion determining the situs of the sale and thus investing the <ORG> within whose territories the sale had thus taken place as the only <ORG> entitled to impose the tax on sale or purchase of goods I however held that under the general law relating to sale of goods a sale must be regarded as having taken place in the <ORG> in which the property in the goods sold has passed to the purchaser and that <ORG> is entitled to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the <ORG> The Explanation to article does not take away the right which the <ORG> in which the property in the goods passed has to tax the sale or purchase but only deems such purchase or sale by a legal fiction to have taken place in the <ORG> in which the delivery of the goods has been made for consumption therein so as to enable the latter <ORG> also to tax the sale or purchase in question The Explanation only lifts the ban imposed by clause a on taxation of sales or purchases which take place outside the <ORG> to the extent of the transactions mentioned in the Explanation to enable the delivery <ORG> also to tax them I also held that the general provision enacted in article against the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the Explanation to article a enabling the delivery <ORG> to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of oases covered by the Explanation the transactions covered by the Explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the <ORG> and thus invested with the character of an intrastate sale or purchase so far as the delivery <ORG> is concerned There was thus a divergence between the learned Judges as regards the true scope and effect of the Explanation to article a read with article and even though the same conclusion was reached by the majority Judges and myself we reached the same on different grounds It may be noted that though there was a consensus of opinion that article was designed to avoid the multiple taxation of a sale or purchase by various <ORG>s having resort to the nexus theory there was divergence of opinion as regards the real purpose of the Explanation as also the construction of the non obstante clause and the true concept of consumption as embodied therein I was of the view that what is otherwise a sale or purchase which takes place outside the <ORG> is deemed to have taken place inside the delivery <ORG> and the only purpose of the Explanation is to introduce a legal fiction whereby the delivery <ORG> is also entitled to tax the transaction of sale or purchase along with the <ORG> in which the transfer of ownership has taken place or the pro perty in the goods has passed I took the the view that the non obstante clause is incorporated in the Explanation to state what according to the Constitution makers is the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership takes place or the property in the goods passes and to indicate that notwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which falls within the category mentioned in the Explanation is nevertheless to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> stated that the object of the Explanation is to fix the location of a sale or purchase by means of a fiction but he disagreed with the view expressed by me that the non obstante clause enunciates the general law on this point He stated that there was no general law which fixed the situs of a sale not even the Sale of Goods Act that what the general law does is to determine the place where the property passes in the absence of a special agreement but the place where the property passes is not necessarily the place where the sale takes place nor has that ever been regarded as the determining factor I adopted the Dictionary meaning of the term and held that the Explanation covers only those cases where as a direct result of the sale or purchase goods are delivered for consumption in the delivery <ORG> by the consumer and it is only that limited class of transactions which are covered by the Explanation and which are liable to tax by the delivery <ORG> The majority Judges differed from this view and held that the Explanation converts the inter<ORG> transaction into an intra <ORG> one and therefore there is no scope at all for the operation of article in cases covered by the Explanation There was a divergence of opinion between <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> on the one side and <NAME> on the other so far as the construction of the words in the course of was concerned He however was of the opinion that in imposing the ban that no law of a <ORG> shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase where such sale or purchase takes place outside the <ORG> the Constitution proceeds on the footing that a sale or purchase has a location or situs He further held that the non obstante clause in the Explanation also clearly implies that the framers of the Constitution adopted the view that a sale or purchase has a situs and further that it ordinarily takes place at the place where the property in the goods passes In his opinion clause a in terms only takes away the taxing power of all <ORG>s with respect to a sale or purchase which by reason of the fiction introduced by the Explanation is to be deemed to take place outside their respective territories and the purpose of the Explanation is only to explain the scope of clause a The Explanation is neither an exception nor a proviso After expressing himself as above he made the following observations which are very apposite to the appeal before us To accede to this argument will mean that the Sales Tax officer of the delivery State will have jurisdiction to call upon dealers outside that State to submit returns of their turn over in respect of goods delivered by them to dealers in that State under transactions of sale made by them with dealers within that State On the contrary it appears to me that they enacted clauses a and for the very purpose of preventing this anomaly In my judgment until <ORG> otherwise provides all sales or purchases which take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce are by clause of article made immune from taxation by the law of any State irrespective of the place where the sales or purchases way take place either under the general law or by virtue of the fiction introduced by the Explanation to clause a If a particular inter State sale or purchase takes place outside a State either under the general law or by virtue of the fiction created by the Explanation it is exempted from taxation by the law of that State both under clause a and clause If such inter State sale or purchase takes place within a particular State either under the general law or by reason of the Explanation it is still exempt from taxation even by the law of that State under clause just as a sale or purchase which takes place within a State either under the general law or by reason of the Explanation cannot be taxed by the law of that State if such sale or purchase takes place in the course of import or export within the meaning of clause It may be observed that the contentions urged before us by the Appellant are in conformity with the above observations of <NAME> Normally speaking the construction put by the majority judgment on the article the Explanation thereto and article of the Constitution in the Bombay Sales Tax appeal would be the law bind ing on all parties and in the judgment just referred to in the Travancore Cochin Sales Tax Appeal <NAME> The question whether the <ORG> bad the power to reconsider the previous decisions of its own and if it thought the decisions wrong to overrule or depart from them in subsequent cases was considered in <ORG> <ORG> Earl of Halsbury who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> observed at page A decision of this <ORG> once given upon a point of law is conclusive upon this <ORG> afterwards and that it is impossible to raise that question again as if it was res integra and could be reargued and so the <ORG> be asked to reverse its own decision and the conclusion was thus recorded at page Under these circumstances it appears to me that your Lordships would do well to act upon that which has been universally assumed in the profession so far as I know to be the principle namely that a decision of this <ORG> upon a question of law is conclusive and that nothing but an Act of Parliament can set right that which is alleged to be wrong in a judgment of this <ORG> In that case an earlier decision of the <ORG> in Wigg Attorney General of <ORG> was attempted to be reviewed and after discussing the case law on the point the <ORG> came to the conclusion that <ORG> is not bound in law and without examination to follow the decision in a prior appeal whether they considered it to be right or wrong although <ORG> would hesitate long before disturbing a solemn decision by a previous <ORG> which raised an identical or even a similar issue for determination It was contended that the case had been wrongly decided and ought to be overruled and their Lordships repelled that contention Their Lordships do not doubt that in tendering humble advice to His Majesty they are not absolutely bound by previous decisions of the <ORG> as is <ORG> by its own judgments The question whether it is bound by its previous decisions came up for consideration in the Tramways Case No The question is not whether the <ORG> can do so but whether it will having due regard to the need for continuity and consistency in judicial decisions Changes in the number of appointed Justices can I take it never of <NAME> at page referred to an earlier decision given by him in the case of <ORG> <ORG> I am at all times prepared to consider the review of any decision of this <ORG> by a Full Bench called to consider that question and to reverse any decision if it is shown to be clearly wrong subject to the well known considerations to be applied to the particular case in question at the time according to the well known judicial policy of British Australian and American <ORG>s and I think of all <ORG>s of Appeal in English speaking communities except <ORG> I decline even to consider a question of reversing a decision of this <ORG> casually or even seriously raised by counsel not clearly urgent and not raised before as full a bench as is available If we do not show some respect to our own <ORG> decisions no counsel will feel safe in advising the public and it will create uncertainty and confusion Under those circumstances I think it would have to be shown that the decision was clearly wrong and as it has been followed by this <ORG> in other cases that it would be in the interests of the public to reverse it This question came for consideration again by <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> and Others and the majority judgment stated at It is therefore in the circumstances the manifest duty of this Court to turn its earnest attention TA thus expressed himself with regard to the propriety upon the part of <ORG> of departing from its earlier doctrines if it has come to consider those doctrines as erroneous The doctrine of stare decisis should not deter us from overruling that case and those which follow it I Second Edition at There are indeed good reasons why the doctrine Of stare decisis should not be so rigidly applied to the constitutional as to other laws We here also are concerned with the construction of the provisions of the Constitution which cannot be amended so easily and if we come to the conclusion that the earlier decision was manifestly Wrong or erroneous and that public interest demanded that the same should be reconsidered we should not have the slightest hesitation in doing so The Government of India Act contained provisions in regard to the distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion and <ORG> in sections and <ORG> was competent to make laws including laws having extra territorial operation for the whole or any part of the Dominion and <ORG> were competent to make laws for the Provinces for any part thereof The legislative heads in respect of which the laws could be made by the respective Legislatures were enumerated in the lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Act and the Entry in List II of the said Schedule gave the power to <ORG> in respect of taxes on the sale of goods and on advertisements <ORG> State of Madras The same distribution of legislative powers obtained when the Constitution came to be enacted and article provided that <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the State Exclusive power to make laws with respect to the legislative heads enumerated in the Union List List I and the State List List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution was given to <ORG> and <ORG> by article Entry of the State List gave the exclusive power to the State Legislatures with respect to taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers This power to tax the sales or purchases of goods would again have to be construed with reference to the connotation of the term sale as it was understood in the legislative practice of the country at the time when the power was conferred As was observed by Their Lordships of the Privy Council in <NAME> Dunphy When a power is conferred to legislate on a particular topic it is important in determining the scope of the power to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in legislative practice and particularly in the legislative practice of the <ORG> which has conferred the power This being the legislative practice in India as well as in England at the time when the power to tax sales or purchases of goods was conferred on the State Legislatures the scope of that power would have been ordinarily determined by the definition of the sale of goods to be found in these respective Sales of Goods Act and the State Legislatures would have had the power to tax sales or purchases of goods in which the property in the goods passed within the respective territories of the States It was a power to tax the sale or purchase of goods which took place within the territories of the State and was to be exercised in those cases where the property in the goods which were the subject matter of the sale or purchase passed within the territories of the State This position however was not acceptable to the various States which wanted to enlarge the scope of their power to tax sales or purchases of goods There was therefore an attempt made to analyse the concept of sale into its various ingredients and to fasten upon any one of the ingredients as conferring upon them the power to tax the sale or purchase of goods by having resort to the theory of territorial connection or nexus When this is done a sale is found to consist of a number of ingredients which can be said to be essential in the sense that if any one of them is missing there is no sale The following are some of them the existence of goods which form the subject matter of the sale the bargain or contract which when executed will result in the passing of the pro perty in the goods for a price the payment or promise of payment of a price the passing of the title Having analysed the concept of the sale thus into its essential ingredients the only essential condition which was considered necessary to be satisfied was the completion of the transaction of sale wheresoever it may take place and the taxable event was taken to be any one of these essential ingredients provided it took place within the territories of the State Reliance was placed for this purpose on the decision of <ORG> in In re The Central Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act The sale was therefore taken to be the concrete event which gave rise to the power of the State to tax the sale of goods but was taken as not necessarily taking place within the territories of the taxing State the only thing considered essential for the purpose being the It was an income tax case and the dispute related to the claim of <ORG> to levy income tax and super tax on the dividends paid to the assessee company which was a joint stock company incorporated under the English Companies Act having its registered offices in the Isle of Man and its main offices in England by nine sterling companies the bulk of whose shares were held by the assessee company It was however held that the source of the dividends paid to the assessee company by the sterling companies was British Indian and when the attempt was to tax income and not the corpus and the question to be considered was the source of that income it was legitimate to take into account the place where the business from which the income was derived was in fact carried on and not to treat the situs of the shares in the eyes of the law as concluding the matter The Court was therefore of the opinion that the source of the dividends paid to the assessee company by the sterling companies was British Indian and that in making them liable to income tax on that basis <ORG> was not giving its law any extra territorial operation <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Court further quoted with approval the following passage from the judgment of <NAME> in <ORG> Federal Commissioner of Taxation at The Constitution requires that it must be possible to predicate of every valid law that it is for the peace order and good government of the Dominion with respect to a granted subject customs taxation external affairs In the former case the <ORG> held that where <ORG> has conferred a power to legislate on a particular topic it is permissible and important in determining the scope and meaning of the power to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in the legislative practice of the United Kingdom The general conception as to the scope of the legislative practice in the United Kingdom with regard to income tax is that given a sufficient territorial connection between the person sought to be charged and the country seeking to tax him income tax may properly extend to that person in respect of his foreign income In the latter case the <ORG> held that a law imposing a tax cannot be impugned on the ground that it is extra territorial if there is a connection between the person who is subjected to the tax and the country which imposes that tax <NAME> also observed at As mentioned above the aspect of it affecting persons who are beyond the jurisdiction of the municipal courts cannot be considered sufficient for the <ORG> to hold it ultra vires A transaction of sale or purchase of goods thus came to be taxed by more States than one even though really there was only one transaction of sale or purchase of goods as between the seller and the purchaser The state of affairs was thus graphically described by <NAME> in his judgment in Bombay Sales Tax Appeal at In exercise of the legislative power conferred upon them in substantially similar terms by the Government of India Act the Provincial Legislatures enacted sales tax laws for their respective Provinces acting on the principle of territorial nexus referred to above that is to say they picked out one or more of the ingredients constituting a sale and made them the basis of their sales tax legislation This situation posed to the Constitution makers the problem of restricting the taxing power on sales or purchases involving inter State elements and alleviating the tax burden on the consumer In the latter case it was held that the power of the State to impose taxes was not conditioned on the subject matter being wholly within its jurisdiction and the exercise of the power was valid if there was sufficient territorial connection with reference to the subject matter only State which had the power to impose a tax In the case of sales tax it is not necessary that the sale or purchase should take place within the territorial limits of the State in the sense that all the ingredients of a sale like the agreement to sell the passing of title delivery of the goods etc As a matter of fact the legislative practice in regard to sale tax laws adopted by the Provincial Legislatures prior to the coming into force of the Constitution has been to authorise imposition of taxes on sales and purchases which were related in some manner with the taxing Province by reason of some of the ingredients of the transaction having taken place within the Province or by reason of the production or location of goods within it at the time when the transaction took place It may be observed that in <ORG> the question of the territorial connection or nexus was not directly in dispute and in <NAME> case referred to above it was taken as decided by this Court in <ORG> that the theory of territorial connection or nexus was applicable to sales tax legislation Whereas in the case of income tax legislation the tax is levied either on a person who is within the territory by exercising jurisdiction over him in personam or upon income which has accrued or arisen to him or is deemed to have accrued or arisen to him or has been derived by him from sources within the territory and it is therefore germane to enquire whether any part of such income has accrued or arisen or has been derived from a source within the territory in the case of sales tax legislation it is the sale or purchase of goods which is the subject matter of taxation and it cannot be predicated that the sale or purchase takes place at one or more places where the necessary ingredients of sale happen to be located Suffice it to say that there was this evil which was rampant in the <ORG> by reason of the various States fastening upon one or more ingredients of the sale and arrogating to themselves the power to tax sales or purchases of goods by reason of the territorial connection or nexus which they claimed to have with one or more of the ingredients of the sale provided however that a sale or purchase ultimately did take place either within their territories or anywhere else Broad based on this conception of freedom of trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India and also with a view inter alia to relieve the consumer of the burden of multiple taxation which he was subjected to by the various State Legislatures by having resort to the territorial connection or nexus theory as aforesaid the Constitution makers in article enacted restrictions on the power of the State Legislatures in regard to the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods and these restrictions were fourfold State Legislatures were restrained from imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place outside the State The State Legislatures were restrained from imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India The State Legislatures were restrained from imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of inter State trade or commerce except in so far as the <ORG> might by law otherwise provide and The State Legislatures were restrained from imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as had been declared by <ORG> by law as essential for the life of the community unless such law had been reserved for the consideration of the President and had received his assent The first restriction was devised to achieve the objective of relieving the consumer of the burden of multiple taxation and put it out of the power of a State to tax the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place outside the State The Sale of Goods Act contained several provisions which determined when a sale or purchase took place or in other words when the property in the goods sold passed from the seller to the purchaser But it was silent in regard to the place where the sale or purchase took place There was no rule of law enacted therein which determined the situs or location of such sale or purchase and resort was therefore had to the general law of the land for the purpose This state of affairs could not be allowed to continue any further having regard to the interests of the consumer and it was therefore thought necessary when the State Legislatures were restrained from imposing a tax on sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place outside the State also to determine when such sale or purchase could be said to take place outside the State The Explanation was thus enacted for the express purpose of determining what sales or purchases could be said to have taken place outside the State and the basic idea which was adopted therein was that under the general law relating to Sale of Goods property in the goods would by reason of such sale or purchase pass in a particular State which would therefore be the situs or location of such sale or purchase But notwithstanding that fact the sale or purchase was deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purposes of consumption in that State The antithesis appears to have been between the State in which the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed and the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State and in the competition between these two <ORG>s the Explanation provided that the sale or purchase in those circumstances shall be deemed to have taken place in the <ORG> in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption therein defined what was a sale or purchase which shall be deemed to have taken place in the delivery <ORG> and thus fulfilled a double function of investing only the delivery <ORG> with the power to tax such sale or pur chase to the exclusion of all other <ORG>s qua whom the sale or purchase was deemed to be an outside sale Whatever be the correct view to take of this Explanation one fact remained that article a and the Explanation thereto were enacted with the one and only motive to relieve the consumer of the burden of multiple taxation to which he was subjected by having resort to the territorial connection or nexus theory and to replace the nexus theory by what may be described as the situs theory fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase and putting a restriction on the taxing power of the <ORG>s qua which it could be predicated that such sale or purchase took place outside the <ORG> thus leaving only one <ORG> in which the goods have been actually delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption therein free to tax the sale or purchase having resort to the powers vested in <ORG> by article and Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution If therefore the situs or location of the sale was laid down as the criterion of the taxing power of the <ORG> the non obstante clause contained in the Explanation gave the clue as to what was in mind of the Constitution makers when they substituted the situa theory in place of the nexus theory which theretofore prevailed They took cognisance of the general law relating to the sale of goods under which the property in the goods passed by reason of such sale or purchase The conception of the transfer of ownership of the goods by the seller to the purchaser was thus accepted by them as determining the situs or location of the sale or purchase and this conception had its roots in the relevant provisions of the Sale of Goods Act both in India and in England and in spite of the fact that those provisions did not in terms say where the sale took place or the transfer of ownership came about or the property in the goods passed by reason of such sale or purchase the general law relating to sale of goods was taken in the Explananation to fix the situs or location of such sale or purchase within the territories of a particular <ORG> and that event could only take place in one <ORG> and not in more <ORG>s than one There could be only one situs or location of the sale or purchase and if that were so the <ORG> in whose territories such sale or purchase took place or in which the property in the goods passed by reason of such sale or purchase was the <ORG> which could claim the power to tax such sale or purchase by reason of its having taken place within its territory While doing so they also created a legal fiction whereby in the competition between what may be called the title <ORG> and the delivery <ORG> the delivery <ORG> was given the power to impose a tax on sale or purchase of goods where the goods had actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that <ORG> If the object to be achieved was the relief of the consumer from the burden of multiple taxation that object could only be achieved by subjecting him to taxation at the instance of one <ORG> only and not by more <ORG>s than one and to that extent the view that both the title <ORG> and the delivery <ORG> would be entitled to impose the tax on the sale or purchase falling within the Explanation was clearly erroneous the only <ORG> which would be in a position to tax the sale or purchase in question being the <ORG> in which the goods had been actually delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption therein The second restriction on the taxing power of <ORG>s was devised to safeguard the import and export trade of the country and embraced transactions of sale or purchase of goods where such sales or purchases took place in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India vide article It is significant to observe that the Explanation to article a was definitely put for the purposes of subclause a and it had therefore no application to the cases which were covered by article The sales or purchases were looked at from different view points and the particular aspect which was dealt with in article was the import export aspect of the transactions of sales or purchases They had nothing in common with the provision contained in article a The third restriction was devised to protect inter<ORG> trade or commerce and covered transactions of sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce except in so far as <ORG> might by law otherwise provide By the st March the <ORG>s could also make representations to the <ORG> and induce the <ORG> to otherwise provide by appropriate legislation within the meaning of article and autborise them to impose taxes on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sales or purchases took place in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce But until that ban was lifted by appropriate legislation by the <ORG> the by imposed under article was absolute and no transaction of sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase took place in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce could ever be made the subject matter of taxation at the instance of <ORG> The Explanation to article a being expressly for the purpose of sub clause a i for the purpose of determining what transaction of sale or purchase was outside the <ORG> or inside the <ORG> as above stated could not be read into article nor could it be read as an exception or proviso to article The whole scheme of article is that four different restrictions are put on the taxing power of the State Legislatures in regard to the sales or purchases of goods and each one of these restrictions has got to be considered separately by itself and it is only those transactions of sale or purchase which do not fall within any of those categories that can be taxed by the State Legislatures by having resort to their powers under article and Entry of List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The learned Government Advocate for Bihar however urged five distinct reasons why article cannot apply to the transactions of sale or purchase covered by article a and the Explanation thereto and they were The class of sales falling under article a form a special class of inter State sales which on general principles ought not to be affected by the general provisions of article If article applies to the class of sales covered by article a and the Explanation thereto it would result in discrimination against local trade in favour of inter State trade and it will be inconsistent with the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution The purpose of article being to eliminate multiple taxation and article a having already achieved that purpose with regard to the class of sales falling within it it was no longer necessary for that purpose to apply article to that class of sales The Constitution itself has divided inter State sales into two categories and in relation to one class it has itself provided which State will tax and under what conditions and in relation to the other class the Constitution itself has imposed a ban in general terms and granted <ORG> power in general terms again to relax that ban as and when <ORG> thinks fit and By a legal fiction the inter State sale is converted into an intrastate sale As to reason it was submitted that the transactions of sale covered by article a and the Explanation thereto and the transactions of sale covered by article were of the same category and both these provisions dealt with the same topic This argument found favour with the <ORG> below as well as myself in the Bombay Sales Tax Appeal This rule of harmonious construction no doubt would apply if the topics covered by both these provisions were the same and the subject matters dealt with in both these provisions were identical There is this difference however between the two provisions viz As to reason there is no question of discrimination against local trade in favour of <ORG> trade if article applied to the class of sales covered by article a and the Explanation thereto If that was the only purpose of the article it might conceivably be argued that once that purpose is achieved in regard to the particular set of transactions which are covered by article a and the Explanation there to there is no further need of putting any ban under article There is no warrant for holding that transactions in the course of inter State trade or commerce are divided into such distinct categories for the purpose of the imposition of the ban It would be an illegitimate extension of the purpose of the legal fiction to say that it was also created for the purpose of converting the inter <ORG> character of the transaction into an intrastate one It was also urged that this construction put upon article a and the Explanation thereto and article would render the Explanation nugatory and that the Constitution makers at the very commencement of the Constitution would not have given the power by one hand and taken it away by the other and that therefore the Explanation to article a should be read as an exception or a proviso to article This argument no doubt found favour with me in the Bombay Sales Tax Appeal and also with <ORG> below If due regard however is had to the purpose of the enactment of article as a whole and also to the various considerations which have been set out herein above it is clear that this argument is untenable There are transactions which would be covered by the There is also a further fact to be noted and it is that even though the transactions covered by both these provisions may be conceivably co extensive or conterminous with each other the Explanation to article a would come into operation the moment the ban of article was lifted by an otherwise provision enacted by <ORG> and it was certainly lifted up to the st March by the President directing the continuance of the operation of the sales tax laws which previously existed in the various <ORG>s if the <ORG>s thought that the operation of the ban under article prevented them from taxing transactions of sale or purchase which take place in the course of inter <ORG> trade and commerce and which are also covered by the Explanation to article a it was open to them to adopt proper measures for lifting the ban under article and making themselves free to tax the transactions of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation <ORG> would in that event consider the proposals made by the respective <ORG>s in their proper perspective having regard to the provisions of the Constitution in regard to the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India the con venience or inconvenience of the public and the needs of the respective <ORG>s and lift the ban in the manner and to the extent it thought fit The majority judgment in the Bombay Sales Tax Appeal has been construed by the various States as giving them an authority to impose a tax on the transactions of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation to article a and authorising them to impose such tax on the seller even though he may be residing outside their territories The non resident businessmen therefore who entered into transactions of sales of goods where as a direct result of such sales the goods are actually delivered for the purpose of consumption in a particular State have been sought to be subjected to the levy of sales tax at the instance of these States with great inconvenience and harassment to themselves and the warrant for their action in this behalf is stated by these States to be the majority judgment of this Court The various States however in the scramble for taxes have been oblivious to the fact that a transaction of sale or purchase is not a unilateral transaction but a bilateral one and when it is looked at from the point of view of a sale or purchase it is one transaction which has two facets It would be by adopting the theory of the territorial connection or nexus as it was being done prior to the enactment of the Constitution that the taxing State would seek to reach the non resident businessmen outside its territories and if regard be had to the fact that the taxation is either in personam or in relation to the transaction of sale or purchase which takes place within its territory there is no warrant at all for taxing the outside businessmen on the transactions of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation to article a All the provisions contained in the Bihar Sales Tax Act with regard to the registration of the outside dealer the maintenance of the books of account submission of returns by him to the Sales Tax authorities of the State of Bihar the production and inspection of books of account before the Sales Tax authorities the search of the premises of the outside dealer by them and the imposition of penalties on him by reason of his noncompliance with the various provisions contained in the Act amongst others are unwarranted and illegitimate exercise of the powers incidental to the power of taxing sales or purchases conferred upon the State of Bihar by article and the Entry in List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and do not affect non resident businessmen who are outside the territories of the State of Bihar State was not before the <ORG> and the observations contained in the majority judgment were made with reference to a pure question of the interpretation of article a and the Explanation thereto There are as many as Sales Tax Act to be found in the Manual of Sales Tax Acts and if a dealer in one <ORG> was going to be held amenable to the levy of sales tax at the instance of all the other <ORG>s it would mean that he would have to ascertain from the purchaser in each of the transactions of sale which he enters into the <ORG> to which the purchaser be The seller in such cases would certainly not be amenable to the levy of a sales tax at the instance of the delivery <ORG> and no law passed by the delivery <ORG> in regard to a levy of sales tax would have any operation against the non resident businessman who enters into a transaction of sale where as a direct result of such sale the goods are actually delivered for consumption within the taxing <ORG> The appeal should therefore be allowed and a direction should issue against the State of Bihar to refrain from taxing the sales or purchases of goods which take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce even though the goods as a direct result of such sale or purchase are actually delivered in Bihar for consumption in that State until <ORG> otherwise provides within the meaning of that expression in article The Appellant should get its costs throughout from the State of Bihar the rest of the parties appearing before us to bear and pay their respective costs of this appeal Our Constitution which has made detailed provision about various matters relating to <ORG> including a matter relating to its practice such as whether there can be a dissenting judgment see article has not in terms made any provision in this behalf Under article of our Constitution the normal procedure provided for amendment except in respect of specified matters to be presently enumerated is as follows An amendment of this Constitution may be initiated by the introduction of a Bill for the purpose in either house of <ORG> and when the Bill is passed in each <ORG> by a majority of the total membership of that <ORG> and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that <ORG> present and voting it shall be presented to the President for his assent and upon such assent being given to the Bill the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill It does not appear to me This is to be gathered from section of the Commonwealth Act of which broadly speaking shows that what is required there is an absolute majority in each of the <ORG> and the approval of each State to be obtained by a referendum to the electors of each State Three cases of <ORG> out of those brought to our notice are instructive The question is not whether the <ORG> can do so but whether it will having due regard to the need for continuity and consistency in judicial decisions Under the circumstances I have no hesitation in following the judgment The principles so laid down have been reiterated in a recent case of <ORG> in <ORG> Federal Commissioner of Taxation in the following terms The Court is not bound by its previous decisions so as absolutely to preclude reconsideration of a principle approved and applied in a prior case but as was stated in <NAME> Malone the exceptions to the rule are exceptions which should be allowed only with great caution and in clear cases Then the above quotation from the judgment of Justice <NAME> in the Tramways Ca was repeated One of the learned Judges Justice <NAME> considered the matter on its merits elaborately and came to the conclusion that if the matter were to be considered afresh he should prefer a view con trary to that which had been expressed in the prior decision but concurred with the majority view with the following observations There appears to me to be no ground for reconsidering the decision in <NAME> case unless it be a sufficient ground simply that the opposite conclusion is to be preferred that was a case where the question which arose was a very important one as to the power of State <ORG> to encroach on the field of the Commonwealth <ORG> by virtue of a rule of construction laid down in an earlier case viz The second is the case in <NAME> The King where <ORG> declined to follow its prior decision in <NAME> case What was under consideration of <ORG> was whether a prior decision of <ORG> construing a particular section of the relevant statute applicable in that case in consonance with the above rule was correct Now what are the grounds in the present case to justify a reconsideration of the prior decision At this stage I cannot help noticing that the argument before us as it appears to me has taken a somewhat unusual course The question that directly arose for consideration in the later case was not the one that had come in for consideration in the earlier case In view of the above facts it appears to me prima facie that there was no reason for reconsideration except the fact that a different view had been taken by two of the learned Judges of this <ORG> and except the chance of a differently constituted majority emerging on rehearing It is said that the prior decision does not merely determine the rights of the two contending parties to that case but has far reaching effects on the rights of the consuming public and that it involves the adjudication of the taxing power of the States as against the consuming public in general It appears to me with respect that this is begging the question There is no absolute standard by which the erroneous character of a previous decision can be as certained As regards the suggestion of tax burden on the consuming public it is relevant to notice that the burden if any which arises under the prior decision can only be by legis It appears to me that that is not a matter for our consideration It is next suggested that there is some vagueness if not inconsistency in the prior majority judgment which justifies reconsideration It is said with reference to a particular passage quoted from the judgment that it is only buyers falling within the Explanation who were contemplated as liable and not the out of <ORG> dealers but that the whole trend of the rest of the judgment and the actual decision runs counter to this That the extracted passage was not meant to indicate that only such purchaser was taxable and not the seller is quite clear from the various passages in the immediately succeeding paragraph at pages and where taxation of sales or purchases involving inter <ORG> elements by the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption in the sense explained The real test to my mind as indicated by Justice <NAME> in Attorney General for <ORG> is whether it was a fully considered judgment and whether any fresh material has been brought to the notice of the <ORG> It has next been suggested that rectification of the error if any in the view taken by the previous decision is difficult and that this could be brought about only by the amendment of the legislative lists necessitating the consent of the requisite number of States The proper course for this <ORG> therefore is to adopt the attitude of Justice <NAME> in the case in Attorney General for <ORG> wherein notwithstanding that he came to a contrary conclusion he declined to disturb the prior decision Notwithstanding my opinion that there is no ground for reconsideration of the prior decision of this <ORG> in the <ORG> case I propose out of respect for my learned brothers who are prepared to take the opposite view to give my reasons why on a fresh consideration of the question involved I am clearly in agreement with the decision of the majority in the said case There can be no doubt that article taken as a whole has to be read in the context of the power vested in the <ORG>s for levying taxes on the sales or purchases of goods other than newspapers under Entry of List of the Seventh Schedule taken with article In this respect it is in contrast with Entry which vests in the <ORG> the power to legislate in respect of trade and commerce within the <ORG> Article appears in Part XII of the Constitution relating to finance property contracts and suits and is in Chapter I thereof relating to finance Keeping this context in view as also the avowed purpose of the article as indicated by the marginal note it may be taken that article was intended to indicate clearly the ambit of the taxing power of the <ORG> on sales or purchases of goods and to limit it to a demarcated field There were sales tax laws in operation in all the then nine Provinces which subsequently became Part A States under the Constitution as also in one Native State of Mysore A dealer was defined as a person carrying on the business of selling or supplying goods in the Province This pattern indicates that apart from the purely internal sales in respect of which the power of taxation by the States was undoubted the States claimed the power to tax sales with an outside element in the following two cases Where the transfer of ownership in the goods was within the State assumed to be so according to the Indian Sale of Goods Act Madras and Mysore had an additional Explanation as follows In case the contract was for the sale or purchase of future goods by description then if the goods are actually produced in the Province at any time after the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made the sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the Province wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act Notwithstanding anything in the Indian Sale of Goods Act the sale of any goods which are produced or manufactured in the Province by the producer or manufacturer thereof shall wherever the delivery or contract of sale is made be deemed for the purposes of the Act to have taken place in the Province It appears to me that in the adjustments called for on the passing of the Constitution it was this feature of the pre existing sales tax law which called for being remedied by the imposition of a ban on taxation of sales with an outside element It appears to me not very reasonable to assume that the Explanation to article a was required in order merely to determine what an outside sale is It has been suggested that the Explanation covers some outside sales which do not fall within article and that therefore the Explanation was necessary It appears to me therefore that the reasons for having these two provisions were distinct and different To such a situation the principle of harmonious construction would apply as enunciated by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> at page in the following terms It is beyond dispute that we are entitled and indeed bound when construing the terms of any provision found in a statute to consider any other parts of the Act which throw light upon the intention of the legislature and which may serve to shew that the particular provision ought not to be construed as it would be if considered alone and apart from the rest of the Act transfer of ownership within the taxing State and the actual presence of goods in the taxing State at the point of time when the transfer of ownership takes place in another State So Car as and Bihar are concerned which authorised the manufacturing <ORG> as such to levy the tax it appears to me that if it is borne in mind that this is limited to the sale by the very manufacturer this But even so there is no justification for the impression of chaotic conditions resulting therefrom which has been assumed There is no evidence before us that prior to the Constitution there was in fact multiple taxation of sales in operation at any rate at more than the two points as explained by me above I On the construction of article reference has also been made in the dissenting view to sub article of article which runs as follows No law made by the <ORG> of a State imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent While sub articles and impose certain bans on taxation what sub article does is not to impose a ban at all but to impose a fetter in respect of taxation on sales of essential goods declared as such by the <ORG> by requiring that before such a taxation law can have any effect it should be reserved for the consideration of the President and receive his assent I am therefore unable to see the bearing of this provision on the construction of the other two provisions which bring about a total or contingent ban of taxation in respect of the sales to which they have reference There is one other matter which has been stressed or implied in the dissenting view and it is this The assumption is that even a single point tax on a sale arising in the course of inter State trade would be a burden on the freedom of inter State trade and commerce guaranteed under the Constitution by article which runs as follows Subject to the other provisions of this Part trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free It appears to me again with great respect that there is no warrant for treating such a tax as in any way contrary either to the letter or the spirit of the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse provided under article For all the above reasons I am quite clear in my mind that the view taken in the prior decision viz that the consuming State has the present power to tax a fictional inside sale which falls within the scope of the Explanation and that the said power is not affected by article and that article cannot be construed as overriding article a read with the Explanation is correct and that there is no reason to depart from that decision In the conclusion reached by my learned brothers who are prepared to uphold the dissenting view taken in the prior decision that question does not arise for consideration and has been left untouched It is true that a defined geographical part of India constitutes the territory of each unit called the <ORG> and that the governance of that unit is committed to that <ORG> But it appears to me that on that account the territory of one <ORG> is not a foreign territory in respect of another <ORG> when freedom of movement and a number of other common fundamental rights are guaranteed In this context it is necessary to bear in mind the following clear dictum of <ORG> in <ORG> The King A legislature which passes a law having extraterritorial operation may find that what it has enacted cannot be directly enforced but the Act is not invalid on that account and the courts of its country must enforce the law with the machinery available to them The following passage from Lord <NAME> speech at page is instructive There is a second question in the case namely whether the appellant has been duly brought within the machinery for assessment provided by the Act It is contended that there was no right to post him such a notice so addressed I am accordingly clear in my opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs Sale with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes also a transfer of property in goods involved in the execu tion of a works contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge Explanation A

on business in the manufacture and sale of sera biological products and medicines On the th December the second respondent issued a notice under section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act Act XIX of hereinafter referred to as the Act calling upon the appellant to register itself as a dealer under the Act and to submit a return for assessment of sales tax To this the appellant sent a reply on the th January disputing its liability on various grounds and after further correspondence between the parties which it is needless to set out the third respondent sent a notice on the th May that if the appellant failed to comply with the notice dated the th December by the th June steps would be I taken to assess tax on the basis of best judgment The appellant replied by filing the application out of which the present appeal arises under article of the Constitution for a writ of prohibition restraining the respondents from proceeding with the assessment The learned Judges of <ORG> upheld both these contentions and dismissed the application and this appeal has been preferred against their judgment on a certificate granted under article of the Constitution On the arguments addressed before us the following points arise for determination Whether the Explanation to article a confers authority on <ORG> to impose tax on sales falling within its purview On the question of the maintainability of the application for a writ of prohibition it was observed by the learned Judges that under section of the impugned Act the Commissioner was competent to decide whether the appellant was a person liable to pay tax under the Act that even if he came to an erroneous conclusion on the merits that did not affect his jurisdiction over the subject matter that the Act itself provided in sections and a complete and effective machinery by way of appeal and revision for correction of such errors and that accordingly a writ of prohibition was not the proper remedy We are not here concerned with a statute whose vires is not in question and which confers jurisdiction on any authority to take proceedings if certain facts exist and the enquiry directed by the authority is as to whether those facts exist The determination in such a case is incidental to the effective exercise by the authority of its undisputed jurisdiction and if as a result of that enquiry it came to an erroneous conclusion there is no error of jurisdiction and it might well be contended in that case that the remedy of the party aggrieved was to resort to the machinery provided in the statute itself by way of appeal or revision and that a writ of prohibition would be misconceived It was argued by Mr <NAME> that if the tax was illegal as contended by the appellant then the proceedings taken for imposing the same would amount to unconstitutional interference with the fundamental right of the appellant to carry on business guaranteed under article and that the courts were bound to interfere under article the Indian Companies Act and the question whether a juristic person is a citizen for the purpose of article is still an open one I would prefer not to rest my decision on this ground It is firstly argued that the Explanation to article a on which the validity of the impugned Act depends confers no authority on <ORG> to impose a tax on sales falling within its purview To appreciate the contentions advanced on either side it must be mentioned that the Act as passed in contemplated the imposition of a tax on residents within the <ORG> They might be natural persons or they might be juristic persons carrying on business within the <ORG> But if the persons who carried on the business of buying and selling did not reside within the <ORG> or carry on business there then the Act did not authorise the imposition of tax on them That was the effect of the definition of dealer as meaning any person who carries on the business of selling or buying goods in Bihar Then came the Constitution and the Explanation to article a enacted that sales shall be deemed to have taken place in that <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption notwithstanding that title to them passed in another <ORG> The construction which the respondent puts on the Explanation is that it confers on the <ORG>s proprio vigore a power to tax sales when the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied Agreeably to this view the Bihar Finance Act Act XVII of substituted for the words who carries on business of selling or buying goods in Bihar the word who sells or supplies any goods Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act a a tax on the sale or purchase of goods shall not be imposed under this Act i where such sale or purchase takes place outside the State of Bihar or ii where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods shall not after the st day of March be Imposed where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide Under the Government of India Act the power to enact a law imposing tax on sale of goods was conferred on <ORG> by Entry in List II as follows The expression for such <ORG> or any part thereof cannot in our view be taken to import into Entry the restriction that the sale or purchase referred to must take place within the territory of that <ORG> All that it means is that the laws which a <ORG> is empowered to make must be for the purposes of that <ORG> In the case of sales tax it is not necessary that the sale or purchase should take place within the territorial limits of the <ORG> in the sense that all the ingredients of a sale like the agreement to sell the passing of title delivery of the goods etc When this is done a sale is found to consist of a number of ingredients which can be said to be essential in the sense that if any one of them is missing there is no sale The following are some of them the existence of goods which form the subject matter of the sale the bargain or contract which when executed When all take place in one State there is no difficulty There is then no sale No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place a outside the State For the purposes of sub clause a a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State It will be convenient hereafter to refer to the State in which title to the goods passes as the selling State and the State in which goods are delivered for consumption as the delivery State Whereas under these provisions a <ORG> could tax irrespective of where a sale took place provided there was sufficient territorial nexus under article a that power can be exercised only when it takes place inside the <ORG> mere nexi being insufficient to support such a power The theory of nexus as a source of jurisdiction to tax was thus abandoned and the power to tax was annexed to the situs of the sale to be exercised by the <ORG> wherein it is fixed and as a given sale can take place only in one <ORG> and in no other it must follow that the power of taxing that sale is capable of exercise only by one <ORG> and not others Its purpose is to fix the situs of a sale when it is of an <NAME> character and it does that by providing that it shall be deemed to have taken place in that <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption But that apart it is delivery of the goods that has been adopted by the Constitution as the determining factor in fixing the situs of the sale not the agreement to sell nor the passing of title to the goods nor other ingredients of sale and there is good reason for this Now the question to be decided is whether in the light of the above discussion the contention of the appellant that the Explanation operates only to deprive the selling <ORG> of its power to tax the sale and that it confers no authority on the delivery <ORG> to impose a tax can be accepted If the Explanation has no application to any but the selling <ORG> it must follow that all the other <ORG>s including the delivery <ORG> will have power to impose a tax under Entry uncontrolled by the Explanation and that will bring into play the nexus theory with its attendant evil of multiple taxation A construction which leads to such a conclusion cannot be accepted unless there are cogent reasons therefor What are those reasons It is urged that article a does not in terms purport to confer a power on the <ORG> to impose a tax on sale that on the other hand it assumes the pre existence of such a power in the <ORG> and then proceeds to restrict it that the substantive provisions which confer power to tax are Entry in List II and article that when a <ORG> has no power to tax under those provisions then article a could have no application as there could be no question of restricting what does not exist and that it could not therefore operate to confer on it such a power The object of article a and there is no dispute about it is to avoid multiple taxation and that as already stated was sought to be achieved by fixing the situs of sale in one <ORG> in accordance with the Explanation It is no doubt true that article a assumes that there is in the <ORG> a power to tax aliunde and then proceeds to restrict it There seems to be no reason for giving the marginal notes in an Indian statute any greater authority than the marginal notes in an English Act of Parliament This reasoning applies with equal force to marginal notes in Indian statutes It is next contended by the appellant that the sales covered by the Explanation to article a are within the prohibition contained in article and that in consequence the charge sought to be imposed on such sales by the impugned Act is illegal and void That raises the question as to what the scope of the Explanation to article a is and whether it is controlled by article Thus the field on which the Explanation operates falls within the area covered by article and there is apparently a conflict between them to it there is no conflict between the Explanation and article The sales to which the Explanation applies are in the course of <ORG> trade and fall within the coverage of article and there is thus a conflict between the two provisions but the Explanation deals with a special topic and therefore prevails against article on the principle of generalia specialisus non derogant and the power to tax thereunder is unaffected The points for determination are thus whether there is conflict between the Explanation to article a and article and if so which of them is to prevail Under the Government of India Act the Provinces had under Entry in List II the exclusive power to make laws in respect of taxes on sale of goods and under Entry in respect of trade and commerce within its territory There was no entry relating to trade and commerce among the Provinces though several topics relating to inter State trade and commerce were specifically enumerated in List The conception of a commerce clause as we now have it was unknown to the Government of India Act In America the authority of the <ORG> to enact laws on the matters delegated to it under the constitution is supreme Under section of article I of the Constitution the power to regulate commerce among the <ORG>s is vested in the <ORG> A question which came up frequently for decision before the <ORG>s was whether the <ORG>s had the power to enact laws with reference to goods which had come into a <ORG> in the course of inter <ORG> trade and it was settled on the highest authority that if the sale was for the purposes of consumption within the <ORG> it became domestic in its character and fell within the power of the <ORG> to regulate and to tax but that if it was for purposes other than consumption such as re sale then that was in the course of inter<ORG> commerce and <ORG> alone had the jurisdiction to legislate in respect of it The gas was transported into the <ORG> by pipe lines from outside and it was accordingly held that the regulation was in respect of inter <ORG> trade and commerce and was therefore subject to applicable Constitutional limitations but that the <ORG> law was valid because the thing which the <ORG> Commission has undertaken to regulate while part of inter <ORG> transmission is local in its nature and pertains to the furnishing of natural gas to local consumers within the city of Jamestown in the <ORG> of New York Examining the question whether the <ORG>s had thereafter the power to enact a law regulating sales which take place in the course of inter <ORG> trade but for local consumption <ORG> held in <ORG> <ORG> that they had and observed Prior to that time this <ORG> in a series of decisions bad dealt with various situations arising from <ORG> efforts to regulate the sale of imported Ed It further held that the <ORG> legislation was itself a recognition of the distinction established by the decisions between sales for resale and direct sale for con sumption iii Sales which take place in the course of interState trade are local in character and within the jurisdiction of the State if they are for consumption within the State The provisions of the Indian Constitution bearing on this subject may now be referred to a The States have exclusive jurisdiction under Entry to impose sales tax and under Entry to regulate trade and commerce within the State There was nothing corresponding to these provisions in the Government of India Act Under the Explanation to article a a sale is deemed to take place within the State in which the goods are delivered for consumption No law of a <ORG> can impose a tax on a sale which takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade When in the same context the Explanation declares that a sale in the course of inter <ORG> trade that this is its scope is common ground must be deemed to have taken place in the <ORG> in which the goods are delivered for consumption its purpose is clearly to take it out of inter <ORG> trade and stamp it with the character of an intra <ORG> sale Each has operation within its own sphere and there is no conflict between them No law of a State shall impose a tax on a sale where it takes place outside that State Explanation A sale shall be deemed to have taken place within that State where the goods are delivered for consumption as a direct result of the sale That would clearly show that the force of the words for the purposes of sub clause a becomes spent when article is excluded from the operation of the Explanation But then it is contended that whatever the form in which the Explanation may be couched it could not be extended beyond article a and projected into article and that unless that was done it was not possible to hold that the sales falling within the Explanation are taken out of the purview of article In my opinion this argument proceeds on a misconception of the real reasoning on which the conclusion that the Explanation and article relate to two different subjects is based No law of a State shall impose a tax on a sale where it takes place outside that State Explanation A sale in the course of inter State trade is inside that State in which goods are actually delivered for consumption The argument of the appellant that article is comprehensive and includes all sales in the course of inter State trade and that therefore the sales covered by the Explanation fall within its purview takes into account only article and the Explanation and it would have been unassailable if the question had to be decided on a construction only of these two provisions An explanation appended to a section or clause gets incorporated into it and becomes an integral part of it and has no independent existence apart from it Article a confers on States power to tax sales inside their territory Explanation to article a enacts that sales in the course of inter State trade in which goods are delivered for consumption in a State shall be deemed to have taken place inside that State Likewise reading article a including the Explanation along with article the result is that the power to tax which the State otherwise possesses has to be exercised subject to the conditions mentioned in the latter when there is a <ORG> declaration thereunder It is next contended that the sales to which the Explanation applies takes place as a fact in the course of <NAME> trade and that the Explanation could not be construed as altering that fact and that its true scope was merely to shift the situs of the sale from the selling to the delivery State But article has no application as there is no sale in the course of interstate trade or commerce In the same illustration if after transporting the goods into State A sells them then also there is no sale in the course of <NAME> trade It is true that there is a sale and there is also a movement of goods from one State to another In the light of the above principles what is the legal character of the sales effected by the appellant and sought to be taxed by the respondent There is firstly the fact that the goods were actually delivered in Bihar and secondly there is the fiction enacted by the Explanation that the sale had taken place not in Bengal but in Bihar The argument of the appellant that there was in fact a movement of goods from Bengal to Bihar and that stood unaffected by the fictional shifting of the situs of the sale from Bengal to Bihar overlooks that by this very shifting the character and complexion of the sale become altered because as the sale follows the transport of goods it cannot according to the principles already stated be said to be in the course of inter State trade Such a contention would be untenable because the expression contract of sale in this context has the same meaning as the words contract of buying and selling I in the definition of inter State commerce given by <NAME> in the passage already quoted and they both refer to the bargain resulting in the sale irrespective of whether it is in the stage of an agreement to sell or whether it is a sale in which title to the goods has passed to the purchaser It is next contended that the view that sales in which goods are delivered for consumption within the <ORG> are not within article would render that provision practically useless because sales for purposes other than consumption such as for resale must be very few and negligible Why should a seller for consumption it is asked get his goods from an intermediary and not directly from the manufacturer But then the Constitution has itself recognised in clear and unmistakable terms a distinction between sales in which goods are delivered for consumption and sales in which they are delivered for purposes other than consumption such as resale and what purpose this distinction serves the appellant has been unable to explain The argument was thus presented Article a bars the selling State in the present case Bengal from taxing the sale because by reason of the Explanation it becomes an outside sale and if article is to be construed as not barring the delivery State in the instant case Bihar from taking the sale then there is no sale to which it can apply and it will serve no purpose Coming next to the sale by Bihar to Bihar will be entitled to tax it under the body of article a as the sale took place inside its limits It will be noticed that this agrees with the first view in its conclusion but it differs from it on the reasoning by which it reaches it According to the first view sales in the course of inter <ORG> trade contemplated by article include only those under which goods are delivered for purposes other than local consumption whereas according to the second they include all sales including those in which goods are delivered for consumption within the <ORG> and those in which they are delivered for other purposes According to this view therefore there is conflict between the Expla nation and article and the solution for it is to be sought in the application of the rule of construction that general provisions do not derogate from the special Sales in which goods are delivered for local consumption fall either outside article or inside it The argument was that article imposed a number of restrictions on the power of the <ORG> to tax sale of goods from different angles when they were outside the <ORG> article a in the course of export or import article in the course of inter <ORG> trade article and in relation to commodities declared essential by <ORG> legislation under article that the Explanation was enacted from the standpoint whether the sales were outside or inside and article from the standpoint whether they were in the course of inter <ORG> trade or intra<ORG> trade and that the purpose and the policy of the two provisions being different their subject matter must be held to be different and that therefore the maxim was inapplicable It is a cardinal rule of construction that when there are in a Statute two provisions which are in conflict with each other such that both of them cannot stand they should if possible be so interpreted that effect can be given to both and that a construction which renders either of them inoperative and useless should not be adopted except in the last resort One application of this rule is that when there is a law generally dealing with a subject and another dealing particularly with one of the topics comprised therein the general law is to be construed as yielding to the special in Now the reason of the rule requires that it should apply whenever there is overlapping of the fields occupied by two conflicting enactments and when that is shown it would not be logical to exclude its application on the ground that the enactments have been made with a different purpose But with respect there is irrefragable logic in his reasoning in that decision and that commends itself to me Then there is the third view that the sales to which the Explanation applies are in the course of interState trade and therefore fall within the purview of article and that in consequence the power of the delivery State to tax those sales is incapable of exercise as it is within the prohibition contained in that article and that when the <ORG> enacts a law in terms of article lifting the ban thereunder then and not until then could the Explanation have any operation These are simple and familiar expressions used by the legislature when it intends that a particular provision in the Statute should be subject to or override another But that result is avoided by the saving clause under which the Explanation can come into operation when there is <ORG>ary legislation lifting the ban under article The harmonious construction which the law favours is one which gives operation to both the provisions at the same time but in their respective spheres This construction far from reconciling the two provisions and giving operation to both of them renders them uncompro misingly hostile and makes their coexistence and co operation impossible There was considerable discussion before us as to the nature and scope of the law that could be enacted under article Nor can it confer a power to tax a sale in the course of <ORG> commerce on any State of its own choice in contravention of the Explanation to article a Its operation can only be negative It was suggested for the appellant that it can do that as regards particular commodities or with reference to particular States and that further in so limiting the operation it could enact suitable provisions for an equitable adjustment of the interests of all the States In any event it must be a profitless task to speculate on the scope and effect of a hypothetical legislation under article and it would be unsafe to base any conclusion as to the true scope of the Explanation on the existence of a power in the <ORG> to enact a law under article The contention based on the proviso to article must now be considered To this contention there are two answers An order issued by the President under the proviso can operate only to continue existing taxes Article has no application to the sale as there is no inter <ORG> movement of goods thereunder This it is contended gives operation to the Explanation consistently with the view that it is controlled by article The assumption underlying this argument is that the property in the goods passed in <ORG> when the instrument of sale was executed though the goods were then located in <ORG> Considering the matter with particular reference to the power of a <ORG> to impose tax sale is a practical conception having relation to the right to enjoy and dispose of the goods and it is a well settled feature of all sales tax legislation that the power to tax the sale is annexed to the place where the goods are located at the time of the contract In Badische Anilin Und Soda Fabrik Hickson there was a contract of sale signed by both the parties in England with reference to goods situated in Switzerland The position in law was thus stated by Lord <NAME> at page As I understood him Mr <NAME> argued that the defendant had vended these goods in England within the terms of the patent In my opinion if you must decide in what country an appropriation of goods by consent takes place it takes place not where the consent is given but where the goods are at the time situate A In view of these observations it cannot be contended that the title to the goods passed in <ORG> and that <ORG> gets the right to tax by reason of the Explanation <ORG> gets the power to tax the sale not under the Explanation but under the general law It was argued for the appellant that the intention of the Constitution makers as disclosed in article was to encourage the free flow of trade and commerce within the Union unimpeded and unobstructed by State legislation that article was enacted in furtherance of that policy as taxation by the States might become so heavy as to become burdensome to inter State commerce that the normal situation envisaged by that article was therefore that no tax should be levied on sales in the course of inter State trade power being reserved in <ORG> to intervene in appropriate cases and that consistently with this policy article should be construed as the controlling provi sion and the Explanation as an emergency reserve The reply of the respondent was that the intention of the Constitution as expressed in article a was to avoid multiple taxation of sales in the course of inter State trade and not to free them from any taxation that the Constitution did contemplate the levy of one tax on every sale and that the construction of the appellant if accepted must place local sales in a greatly disadvantageous situation as against sales in the course of inter State trade and that must result in driving out local trade and business across the borders of the State There is besides the apprehen sion expressed by the respondent and it cannot be brushed aside as fanciful that if the contention put forward by the appellant is accepted then it must inevitably result in local trade shifting on to adjacent <ORG>s It was next argued for the appellant that the view that under the Explanation delivery States would be entitled to tax all sales in the course of inter State trade if goods are delivered for consumption there would render sellers liable to be taxed in all the States in which their goods are sold and that would subject them to a perplexing multitude of assessment proceedings in several States and that must cause great inconvenience and hardship in business circles Our attention was also invited to the provisions of the impugned Act relating to assessment and collection of tax and it was contended that they must result in considerable harassment of the assessees The Explanation applies to goods delivered for consumption within the <ORG> and the tax imposed on the sale of such goods is really a tax laid on the purchasers for consumption It was argued by the appellant that in the above case the foreign company was a retailer maintaining a place of business within the <ORG> Prior to the Constitution the <ORG>s bad the power to tax even sales in the course of interstate trade and commerce and it is stated that a substantial portion of their revenue was derived from this source The position therefore is that we have to choose between depriving the <ORG>s of their power to impose a tax on which their very existence depends and exposing the sellers having business outside their <ORG> to the inconvenience of multiple assessment proceedings The learned Attorney General appearing for this <ORG> did not contend for any right in it to tax the sales Under Entry in List II of the Government of India Act the States had the power to impose tax on sale of goods and advertisements Thus the decision to entrust the power to tax sales to the States was deliberate and there is good reason for it Sales might take place either in the course of <ORG> trade or be intraState To confer a power on the <ORG> to tax sales in the course of <ORG> trade alone would be to dichotomise the power to impose sales tax and distribute it between the States and the <ORG> What difference will it make in the present position So far as sellers are concerned they will have to submit one consolidated statement of all the sales outside their State instead of splitting them according to the States in which the sales are effected and there will be a single assessment proceeding instead of as many as the States where the sales take place Such a law cannot be impugned as trespassing on the exclusive domain of the States to impose sales tax under Entry as the authority to impose the tax would continue to be the States It is scarcely necessary to add that this suggestion is only by way of answer to the one put forward by the appellant and even if there are Constitutional difficulties in the way of acting on it that would not affect the decision of this appeal which must turn on the provisions of the Constitution as they stand Having carefully considered the arguments addressed by the learned counsel appearing for the parties to the appeal and for the interveners I am clearly of opinion that the sales falling within the Explanation are by reason of the fiction enacted therein intraState sales that accordingly they fall outside the ambit of article and are unaffected by the prohibition contained therein to which reference has been made in the course of the discussion That raises the question whether this <ORG> has the power to reconsider a previous judgment given by it on the identical issue As the point arises for decision for the first time before this <ORG> and as our pronouncement thereon must be of the highest importance we have heard arguments as to what the practice is in the highest judicial tribunals of other countries with reference to this matter <NAME> In <ORG> <ORG> it was held by <ORG> that its decision on a question of law was conclusive and binding on the <ORG> in subsequent cases and that if it was erroneous it could be set right only by an Act of <ORG> In <NAME> Clifton Lord <NAME> dealing with this question observed as follows In the case of decisions of final Courts of appeal on questions of law affecting civil rights especially rights of property there are strong reasons for holding the decisions as a general rule to be final as to third parties In <NAME> Commonwealth <ORG> has ruled that it has the power to examine the correctness of its previous decisions The reason given for this view is that while errors of law not bearing on constitutional provisions could be corrected by ordinary process of legislation an error on a question of constitutional law could be set right only by resort to the dilatory and cumbersome machinery of amending the Constitution It was argued for the respondents that article gives the decisions of this <ORG> the status of law and that therefore if they are to be changed that could be only by process of legislation There is therefore good It must greatly impair the value of the decisions of this <ORG> if the notion came to be entertained that there was nothing certain or final about them which must be the con sequence if the points decided therein came to be re considered on the merits every time they were raised It should be noted that though <ORG> has repeatedly declared that it has the power to reconsider its decisions in fact no instance has been quoted in which it did actually reverse its previous decision except in ecclesiastical cases The question then resolves itself to this There are questions of law on which it is not possible to avoid difference of opinion and the present case is itself a signal example of it It is for this reason that article invests decisions of this <ORG> with special authority but the weight of that authority can only be what we ourselves give to it <NAME> <ORG> that it had caused great hardship to the business world I have already held that there is not much of substance in this complaint On the other hand acting on the view that the Explanation confers on the delivery States power to tax the sales several States amended their Sales Tax Act in by inserting appropriate provisions and it is represented before us that for some years taxes have been collected by the States on the basis of these provisions The Constitutional provisions bearing on this question are articles and which are as follows Subject to the provisions of this Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the Legis Subject to clauses and the <ORG> of any State specified in Part A or Part of the First Schedule has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the State List The contention of the appellant is that the words for the whole or any part of the <ORG> in article and for such <ORG> or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in article impose a territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of the <ORG> Legislature that under these provisions it can enact laws only for persons and properties within the <ORG> and that the provisions of the Act to the extent that they impose tax on sellers who are outside the <ORG> are ultra vires The questions thus raised are of great importance involving the determination of the nature and extent of the power which a <ORG> has to make laws in respect of the matters enumerated in List II A sovereign <ORG> has plenary jurisdiction to enact laws for its own territory A State has jurisdiction over a person a if he is within the territory of the State if he is domiciled in the <ORG> although not present there if he has consented or subjected himself to the exercise of jurisdiction over him either before or after the exercise of jurisdiction A <ORG> has jurisdiction over all acts done or events occurring within the territory of the <ORG> and over all failures to act in cases where there is a legal duty to act within the <ORG> Thus a law of a <ORG> taking over the management of lands of absentee landlords must operate on owners who are residing abroad There is another sense in which these words are used When a <ORG> enacts a law with reference to an act or event which takes place outside its territory it is described as extra territorial and such legislation is recognised as valid by rules of International Law where it is directed against its own nationals and persons in its service In Corpus Juris Secundum extraterritoriality is defined as the act by which a State extends its jurisdiction beyond its own boundaries into the territory of another State and it is added that the almost self evident proposition should perhaps also be noted in this connection that a sovereignty has power to make laws regulating the conduct of its subjects while beyond the limits of its territorial jurisdiction In this connection extra territorial legislation means a law of a State with reference to its own citizens in respect of acts or events which take place outside the State Now the question is can <ORG> make laws with extra territorial operation in the sense stated above The appellant contends that it cannot and calls in aid observations and decisions of <ORG> with reference to the powers of a subordinate or colonial legislature to enact laws with extra territorial operation In construing it as intended to apply to crimes committed within the State Lord <NAME> observed that the jurisdiction of the colonies to enact laws was confined within their own territories and that it would have been beyond the jurisdiction of the Colony to enact a law in respect of a crime committed outside their territory <NAME> <NAME> The King the question was as to the validity of section of the Criminal Code of the Dominion of Canada which enacted that no appeal shall lie in criminal case to any authority in the United Kingdom by way of appeal or petition to His Majesty in Council It was held by Viscount <NAME> that that section was repugnant to the Privy Council Acts of and and was therefore void under the Colonial Laws Validity Act and that accordingly the appeal to <ORG> was competent There the question related to the validity of sections and of the Customs Act of Canada under which the officers of the State were authorised to search ships within miles of the coast and seize dutiable goods found in them the provisions being obviously intended to aid in the effective collection of customs There was no dispute that the legislation was within the competence of <ORG> customs being one of the topics enumerated in section of the British North America Act but the attack was on the validity of sections and on the ground that their operation was extra territorial Thus the question raised is the very question which now arises for determination Once it is found that a particular topic of legislation is among those upon which <ORG> may competently legislato as being for the peace order and good Government of Canada or as being one of the specific subjects enumerated in section British North America Act their Lordships see no reason to restrict the permitted scope of such legislation by any other consideration than is applicable to the legislation of a fully Sovereign State The law as settled by this decision may thus be stated Whether a subordinate <ORG> has power to enact laws with extra territorial operation will depend on the terms of the Constitution Act which creates it and subject to any limitations contained therein it has in respect of the topics assigned to it powers of legislation as plenary as the Sovereign <ORG> which constitutes it But there is nothing in the observations in <ORG> The King relied on by the appellant to support the contention that the view expressed in <NAME> case was adopted in preference to that taken in <NAME> Dunphy in fact there was no decision at all on this point <NAME> phy because they were reached not with reference to the Statute of Westminster about the applicability of which retrospectively to the case before the <ORG> there was controversy but on general principles and what is more to the present case it was the law as declared in <NAME> Dunphy that was before the framers of the Constitution when they enacted sections and of the Government of India Act Ch the corresponding provision was section a which enacted that the Indian <ORG>s have the power to make laws for all persons for all <ORG> and for all places and things within the British India Under these provisions it cannot be doubted that the Indian <ORG>s would have had no jurisdiction to enact laws operating on persons who were not within the State as that would be plainly opposed to the limitation that they should be for persons within the territory Both section of the Charter Act and section a of the Government of India Act are based on the theory which was then widely held that a subordinate <ORG> had no competence to enact laws with extra territorial operation Subject to the provisions of this Act <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any Subject to the two preceding sub sections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws for a Province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Provincial Legislative List The scope of the legislative power conferred by sections and is precisely the same as that conferred on the Legislatures of Canada under sections and of the British North America Act That was also a power conferred on <ORG> or the <ORG> to make laws for the Dominion or the Province in respect of the matters mentioned in sections and respectively A law which satisfies the two conditions prescribed in sections and therefore must be held to be intra vires even though it might have extra territorial operation The precise extent of the powers conferred by sections and has also been the subject of considerable judicial consideration In Governor General in <ORG> <ORG> the question was as to the liability of a Company which was incorporated under the English Companies Act having its main office in England and no place of business in India to be assessed to income tax under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act The Company held the bulk of shares in nine Companies which were also registered in England and controlled from there and carried on business in British India and earned profits The Explanation to section i of the Indian Income tax Act enacts that a dividend paid outside British India shall be deemed to be income accruing in or arising in British India to the extent to which it has been paid out of profits subjected to tax in British India The Company resisted the claim inter alia on the ground that as it was not resident in British India and did not carry on business there <ORG> had no competence to impose a tax on it and that the provisions of the Act were ultra vires as extra territorial in their operation <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> held firstly that as the source of the income which was subjected to tax was Indian it was competent for the Indian <ORG> to impose a tax thereon and no question of extra territorial operation arose That is to say Entry in List I gave power to the Indian <ORG> to tax income which arises from British India even though the person to be taxed was not resident within British India It held a share in a firm called <ORG> which was carrying on business in Bombay The appellant was sought to be taxed not merely on its income as partner of the Bombay firm about which there was no dispute but also on the income of over seven lakhs of rupees which had arisen and bad accrued to it abroad The Federal <ORG> rejected this contention There was an appeal against this judgment to <ORG> i <ORG> I Commissioner Bombay Affirming the judgment of <ORG> Lord <NAME> observed that the fact that the appellant was a member of the partnership carrying on business in British India was irrelevant in considering whether the legislation was intra vires that it was to be assumed that there was no connection between the <ORG> and British India except the derivation from British India of the larger part of their income and that the validity of the legislation should be determined on that basis He then observed There is no rule of law that the territorial limits of subordinate legislature define the possible scope of its legislative enactments or mark the field open to its vision The ambit of the powers possessed by a subordinate legislature depends upon the proper construction of the statute conferring those powers He then referred to section and section of the Government of India Act under which <ORG> had power to enact laws for the whole or part of British India with respect to tax on incomes and concluded The resulting general conception as to the scope of income tax is that given a sufficient territorial con nection between the person sought to be charged and the country seeking to tax him income tax may properly extend to that person in respect of his foreign income The principle sufficient territorial connection not the rule giving effect to that principle residence is implicit in the power conferred by the Government of India Act It is the contention of the respondent that the present question is concluded by this decision There was a Company called <ORG> carrying on business in Bombay It was held by all the learned Judges following the decisions in Governor General in <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> I Commissioner Bombay that the assessee would be liable to tax if there was sufficient business connection between him and British India and that in that event the provisions would not be bad on the ground of extra territorial operation There was however a difference of opinion among the learned Judges as to whether on the facts sufficient territorial connection had been established the majority holding that it had been while two learned Judges These authorities establish that under section and section of the Government of India Act a law enacted by <ORG> in respect of the matters enumerated in the appropriate list would be valid provided it is for the territory entrusted to their charge that whether it was so or not would depend on whether there was sufficient territorial connection between the person who is sought to be charged or proceeded against under the law and the country which enacts the law and that when such connection exists the law is not strictly speaking extra territorial and it is not ultra vires on the ground that the person is not residing within the <ORG> which enacts the law They confer on the <ORG> and <ORG> power to enact laws in respect of the topics mentioned in the respective lists to be exercised for the territory over which they have jurisdiction It is only the Central or Federal <ORG> that has the power to enact laws with extra territorial operation and that the <ORG>s of the States forming units of <ORG> do not possess such power Under article there is a prohibition against States enacting laws with extra territorial operation In <NAME> The Queen which is one of the cases on which the decision in <NAME> <NAME> was based the law under challenge was that of the Province of Ontario in Canada in respect of a topic enumerated in section of the British North America Act of The question whether <ORG>s as distinct from the Commonwealth have competence to enact laws with extra territorial operation has also been considered in some of the decisions of the Australian <ORG> The words extra territorial operation are used as already stated in two different senses as connoting firstly laws in respect of acts or events which take place inside the State but have operation outside and secondly laws with reference to the nationals of a State in respect of their acts outside that in its former sense the laws are strictly speaking intra territorial though loosely termed extra territorial and that under article it is within the competence of the <ORG> and of the State <ORG>s to enact laws with extra territorial operation in that sense The words laws with extraterritorial operation in article must be understood in their second and strict sense as having reference to the laws of a State for their nationals in respect of acts done outside the State Section of the Charter Act while restricting the scope of legislative authority to persons and things within the State thus denying the power to enact laws with extra territorial operations in the first sense conferred a power to make laws for all servants of the <ORG> within the Dominion of Princes and States in alliance with the said <ORG> Section of the Government of India Act followed the same pattern and while limiting under sub clause a the power of Indian <ORG>s to enact laws for persons and things within British India conferred jurisdiction to enact laws with extra territorial operation in the second sense by sub clauses and which are as follows The Indian <ORG> has power to make laws for all subjects of His Majesty and servants of the Crown within other parts of India and for all native Indian subjects of His Majesty without and beyond as well as within British India and for the government of officers soldiers airmen and followers in His Majesty Indian forces wherever they are serving in so far as they are not subject to the Army Act or the Air Force Act and for all persons employed or serving in or belonging to <ORG> Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by the preceding sub section no Federal law shall on the ground that it would have extra territorial operation be deemed to be invalid in so far as it applies a to British subjects and servants of the Crown in any part of India or to British subjects who are domiciled in any part of India wherever they may be or to or to persons on ships or aircraft registered in British India or any Federated States where ever they may be or in the case of a law with respect to a matter accepted in the Instrument of Accession of a Federated State as a matter with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for that State to subjects of that State wherever they may be or in the case of law for the regulation or discipline of any naval military or air force raised in British India to members of and persons attached to employed with or following that force wherever they may be In Governor General in <ORG> <ORG> the question was raised whether these provisions were restrictive of the power of <ORG> to enact laws with extra territorial operation in respect of matters other than those enumerated in section <NAME> held that as the impugned provisions were within the ambit of legislative power under sections and of the Government of India Act they were not extra territorial in operation and that even if they were the words without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by the preceding sub section occurring in section posited the existence of a power aliunde and that the enumeration of the specified topics in that sub clause was by way of abundant caution As we are concerned in this appeal with extra territorial operation in its first sense article has no application and the attack on the impugned Act on the ground that it is barred by article must fail The argument was that even if <ORG> had the competence to enact under Entry a taxation law against non residents it had no power to enforce it outside its own territorial limits and some of the provisions were bad on this ground such as section which authorised search of premises and seizure of accounts and section which made it an offence to obstruct such search or seizure The respondent issued notice under section of the Act calling upon the appellant to send his returns and proposing in case of default to make assessment on the basis of best judgment Even if some of the machinery sections Ire bad it is a question to be decided when it arises whether they can be justified on the ground that they are ancillary or incidental to the substantive provisions as to which see Attorney General for Canada Cain and <NAME> Dunphy that would not affect the power of the State to impose a tax and it will therefore be foreign to the scope of this appeal to enter into a discussion of their validity In <ORG> <ORG> <NAME> observed A legislature which passes a law having extraterritorial operation may find that what it has enacted cannot be directly enforced but the Act is not invalid on that account and the courts of its country must enforce the law with the machinery available to them A State has jurisdiction to enact laws in respect of acts and events which occur within its territory and if a sale takes place within the State as under the Explanation it does by a legal fiction then its jurisdiction to enact a law imposing a tax thereon is complete and no question of its overstepping its territorial limits arises There is no presumption that the laws of a State made with reference to acts and events occurring within its borders are not intended to have operation outside its territory It therefore follows that the power to impose a tax on sale imports a power to tax either the seller or the purchaser It was held that it did and it was observed that when Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution substituted for the words tax on sales occur ring in Entry the words tax on sale or purchase it did not thereby enlarge the powers previously conferred by Entry but merely expressed in clearer language what was implicit in that corresponding entry When article a and the Explanation refer to a sale or purchase they merely conform to the terms of Entry and these words cannot therefore be construed as splitting up the power to tax sales into two parts one available against the purchaser at all times as in the very nature of it he must be within the <ORG> and the other against a seller if he is within jurisdiction It is general and unqualified and will comprehend all cases in which goods are delivered for consumption in the taxing State irrespective of whether the seller is within the State or not and for this there is no justification On the other hand there are good reasons why the power should have been vested in the legislature to determine whether it will tax the seller or the buyer It is difficult to see what there is in this section to support the contention that delivery to a common carrier is actual delivery to the purchaser On the other hand it proceeds on the assumption that there was in fact But where no such question arises the fiction has to be ignored and the matter will have to be decided on the factual basis whether the goods were actually delivered The fact is that while for some purposes delivery to the common carrier is treated as delivery to the purchaser there is delivery in fact and in its popular sense only when the purchaser obtains possession of the goods and it is this that is connoted by the words actual delivery The actual delivery to the vendee or his agent which puts an end to the transitus or state of passage may be at the vendee own warehouse or at a place which he uses as his own though belonging to another for the deposit of goods <NAME> Prettit <NAME> Pickford or at a place where he means the goods to remain until a fresh destination is communicated to them by orders from himself <NAME> Baldwen or it may be by the vendee taking possession by himself or agent at some point short of the original intended place of destination SINHA I have had the advantage of perusing the judgments prepared by my brothers <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> should be overruled and of my brother <NAME> that it should be followed I have come to the conclusion that the latter view is more acceptable We are all agreed that in a proper case it is permissible for this <ORG> to go back upon its previous decision but we are again divided as to whether this is a fit occasion for reviewing its previous decision For the reasons given by my brothers <NAME> and <NAME> I would agree with them in holding that sufficient grounds have not been made out for overruling that decision which bad been taken after bearing all the parties interested in the result of the case If this <ORG> has taken a view of the relevant provisions of the Constitution which does not commend itself to the acceptance of the <ORG> the latter can make necessary amendments as has been done in the recent past There is a general agreement amongst us I take it that the main purpose of creating the fiction is to prevent multiple taxation of the same transaction but it may be added not altogether to stop the taxation of such transactions We are also agreed that full effect must be given to the legal fiction on the supposition that the putative state of affairs is the real one I do not find myself in agreement with the view propounded by my brother <NAME> chiefly because that view goes beyond the purpose of the creation of the fiction which admittedly was to prevent multiple taxation On the whole therefore I would agree with the view that the previous decision of this Court in should continue to hold good and govern the present controversy also In that view of the matter I would dismiss this appeal with costs The appeal is allowed and an order shall be issued directing that until <ORG> by law provides otherwise the <ORG> of Bihar do forbear and abstain from imposing Sales Tax on out of <ORG> dealers in respect of sales or purchases that have taken place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce even though the goods have been delivered as a direct result of such sales or purchases for consumption in Bihar The <ORG> must pay the costs of the appellant in this <ORG> and in the <ORG> below
