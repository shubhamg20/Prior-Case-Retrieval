They had applied to the District Magistrate for the requisite permission to institute the suit under of the Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act The <NAME> decreed the suit In this Court the appellants contended i ss and of the Act totally excludes the jurisdiction of civil courts in relation to the question as to whether permission has been properly or validly granted or refused by the appropriate authority exercising their powers under the relevant provisions of the Act and ii the decision of <ORG> that the permission granted by the Commissioner was invalid in law was inconsistent with the true scope and effect of the provisions prescribed by of the Act The two tests which are often considered relevant in dealing with the question about the exclusion of civil courts jurisdiction are a whether the special statute which excludes such jurisdiction has used clear and unambi guous words indicating that intention and does that statute provide for an adequate and satisfactory alternative remedy to a party that may be aggrieved by the relevant order under its material provisions There are three categories of cases in which the commissioner can interfere with the order passed by the District Magistrate a if the District Magistrate has acted illegally if he has acted with material irregularity and if he has wrongly refused to act This last ground is wide enough to empower the Commissioner to correct the error committed by District Magistrate in making an order brought before it clearly if the District Magistrate refused to grant permission and the Commissioner thinks that in doing so he has committed an error that would be a case where the District Magistrate has wrongly refused to act and that would give the Commissioner jurisdiction to exercise his revisional powers Section of the Act imposes certain restrictions on the landlord right to eject his tenant from the premises to which the Act applies Broadly stated the effect of the provisions contained in is that a landlord can evict his tenant if he satisfies two conditions The first condition is that he must obtain the permission of the District Magistrate to file such a suit and the second condition is that he must provethe existence of one or the other of the seven grounds enumeratedin clauses a to of We shall presently refer to therelevant provisions of this section In their plaint the appellants pleaded that they needed the premises in suit to carry on their own business in the shop and they alleged that they had applied for permission to the District Magistrate Moradabad under of the Act that the said permission had been refused by him whereupon they had moved the Commissioner in his revisions jurisdiction under of the Act and that the Commissioner had given them permission to file the suit They urged that the suit was bad for non joinder of necessary parties that the permission to sue granted to the appellants by the Commissioner was not valid in law that the rent note executed by them was not admissible in evidence and that the notice given by the appellants under section of the Transfer of Property Act was also invalid in law The learned single Judge of the said <ORG> who heard this appeal upheld the respondents contention that the permission granted by the Commissioner under of the Act was invalid in law and so he came to the conclusion that the appellants suit was incompetent The Letters Patent Appeal was placed before a larger Bench of three learned Judges of <ORG> because it was thought that the question raised by the appellants was of some importance On the question as to whether the permission granted by the Commissioner was valid or not the learned Judges who heard the appeal differed At the hearing of this appeal the first point which Mr <NAME> for the appellants has raised for our decision is that the courts below had no jurisdiction to consider the question about the validity of the permission granted by the Commissioner In support of this argument Mr <NAME> has based himself on the provisions contained in and of the Act Similarly provides that no order made under this Act by the State Government or the District Magistrate shall be called in question in any Court The combined effect of these two provisions according to Mr <NAME> is to exclude the jurisdiction of the civil courts to entertain the question about the correctness propriety or legality of the order passed by the Commissioner in the present case whereby he granted permission to the appellants to bring the present suit Subject to any order passed under sub section no suit shall without the permission of the District Magistrate be filed in any Civil Court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds Section and as they stood at the relevant time read thus The party aggrieved by the order of District Magistrate granting or refusing to grant the permission referred to in sub section may within days from the date of the order or the date on which it is communi cated to him whichever is later apply to the Commissioner to revise the order If he is satisfied that the District Magistrate has acted illegally or with material irregularity or has wrongly refused to act he can make an appropriate order and the order thus made by him is final under sub subject to any order that <ORG> may pass under of the Act Section provides for the revisional powers of <ORG> in very wide terms It reads thus <ORG> may call for the record of any case granting or refusing to grant permission for the filing of a suit for eviction referred to in section or requiring any accommodation to be let or not to be let to any person under section and may make such order as appears to it necessary for the ends of justice It is clear that the power conferred on <ORG> by to revise the orders passed by the Commissioner under is very wide It may call for the record suo moto and it can exercise its powers in the interests of justice In other words whenever it is brought to the notice of <ORG> either by a party aggrieved by the order passed by the Commissioner or otherwise that the order passed by the Commissioner is unfair or unjust <ORG> may in the ends of justice pass an appropriate order revising the order made by the Commissioner Mr <NAME> contends that the words of read with are clear and unambiguous and they indicate that the jurisdiction of the civil courts is completely excluded in relation to the question as to whether permission has been properly or validly granted or refused by the appropriate authorities exercising their powers under the relevant provisions of the Act It cannot be seriously disputed that the jurisdiction of the civil courts to deal with civil causes can be excluded by the <ORG> by special Acts which deal with special subject matters but the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil courts must be made by a statutory provision which expressly provides for it or which necessarily and inevitably leads to that inference Another test which is applied is does the said statute provide for an adequate and satisfactory alternative remedy to a party that may be aggrieved by the relevant order under its material provisions Applying these two tests it does appear that the words used in and are clear This conclusion however does not necessarily mean that the plea against the validity of the order passed by the District Magistrate or the Commissioner or <ORG> can never be raised in a civil court If it is shown by a party impeaching the validity of the order in a civil court that the order was passed by a person who was not a District Magistrate the order in law would be a nullity and such a plea cannot be ruled out on the ground of the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court Similarly if an order granting permission to a landlord is passed by a District Magistrate of one District when the property in question is situated in another district outside his jurisdiction a party would be entitled to urge before a civil court that the permission purported to have been granted by the District Magistrate is wholly invalid and a nullity in law Let us take another case to illustrate the position If had provided that before a District Magistrate grants permission to the landlord to sue his tenant he shall issue notice to the tenant and give him an opportunity to represent his case before the application of the the merits and in the face of such a statutory provision the District Magistrate grants permission ex parte without issuing notice to the tenant in such a case the failure of the District Magistrate to comply with the mandatory provision prescribed in that behalf would render the order passed by him completely invalid and a plea that an order has been passed by the District Magistrate without complying with the mandatory provision of the Act would be open for examination before a civil court authorities contemplated by are in the nature of quasi judcial proceedings and they must be tried in accordance with the principles of natural justice and it is shown that in a given case an order has been passed without notice to the party affected by such order it would be open to the said party to contend that an order passed in violation of the principles of natural justice is a nullity and it existence should be ignored by the civil court Such a plea cannot in our opinion be excluded by reason of the provisions contained in and of the Act In this connection we may incidentally refer to a recent deciSion of this Court in Lala Shri Bhagwan A nr In that case this Court upheld the decision of <ORG> which had set aside the order passed by the appropriate authority under the relevant provisions the Act on the ground that in passing the said order principles of natural justice had not been followed The view which was taken by this Court in that case was that the proceedings taken by a landlord under are proceedings of a quasi judicial nature and the appropriate authorities in exercising their powers in relation to such proceedings must act in accordance with the principles of natural justice It must however be made clear that in that case the question as to whether such a plea can be raised in a civil court having regard to the bar created by sections and of the Act was not raised and has not been considered This decision show that if the special statute prescribes certain mandatory conditions subject to which the orders in question can be passed and the said mandatory provisions are violated the validity of the said orders can be challenged in a civil proceeding In that case though the words used in sections and of the Sea Customs Act were held to exclude the jurisdiction of the civil courts A I A <ORG> observed that even where jurisdiction is excluded the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure This latter clause presumably covers cases where orders are passed in violation of the principles of natural justice The conclusion reached by this Court in The second point which then calls for our decision in the present appeal is is the permission granted by the Commissioner without jurisdiction and as such a nullity The majority decision of <ORG> is in favour of the respondents and Mr <NAME> argument is that the said decision is inconsistent with the true scope and effect of the provisions prescribed by of the Act of the Code confers revisional jurisdiction on <ORG> to make such order as it thinks fit in a given case if the subordinate court whose order is brought before <ORG> under appears a to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law or to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested or to have acted in exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity There is no doubt that the requirements of clauses a all centre round the question about the jurisdiction of the subordinate court and the view which has been accepted by the majority decision under appeal is that the same limitation must be imported in construing orders passed by District Magistrates and the District Magistrates normally would have jurisdiction to deal with applications made by landlords There are three categories of cases in which the Commissioner can interfere with the order passed by the District Magistrate This last clause is wide enough to empower the Commissioner to correct the error committed by the District Magistrate in making an order brought before it quite clearly if the District Magistrate refuses to grant permission and the Commissioner thinks that in doing so he has committed an error that would be a case where the District Magistrate has wrongly refused to act and that would give the Commissioner jurisdiction to exercise his revisional power It is significant that the revisional application can be made to the Commissioner only against orders passed by the District Magistrate granting or refusing to grant such permission It is we think fallacious to assume that a party can move the Commissioner under in cases where the District Magistrate just refuse to make an order on the application made by the landlord for permission to bring a suit against the tenant That is why it must be held that <ORG> was in error in coming to the conclu sion that the permission granted by the Commissioner in exercise of the powers conferred on him by is invalid in law As we have already emphasised the only plea which can be raised before a civil court in relation to orders passed under the relevant provisions of the Act can be a plea which if sustained would render the order wholly invalid and as such a nullity The amended provision reads thus The Commissioner shall hear the application made under sub section as far as may be within six weeks from the date of making it and he may if he is not satisfied as to the correctness legality or propriety of the order passed by the District Magistrate or as to the regularity of proceedings held before him alter or reverse his order or make such other order as may be just and proper There is no doubt that under this amended provision the Commissioner can deal not only with the legality but also with the correctness and propriety of the order passed by the District Magistrate Therefore there is no doubt that the relevant provisions of the Act did not intend even prior to the amendment of to limit the jurisdiction of the Commissioner only to cases where irregularity or illegality bad been committed by the District Magistrate in granting or refusing to grant permission The result is the appeal is allowed the order passed by <ORG> in the Letters Patent Appeal is set aside and that of <ORG> restored with costs throughout
