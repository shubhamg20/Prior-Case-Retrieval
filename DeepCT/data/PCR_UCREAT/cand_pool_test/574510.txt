Selection Committees were constituted which recom mended candidates for posts weightage was given to candidates belonging to the reserved category <ORG> quashed the employment notice and set aside the appointments made to the posts Aggrieved the appellants have preferred the present appeal against the decision of <ORG> A It is common knowledge that the vacancies in posts in different subjects occur from time to time according to the exigencies of the circumstances and they arise unequally in different posts A However the course to be adopted would depend upon the unit of reservations the period over which the backlog is to be carried the number of appointments already made in the relevant posts the availability of candidates from the reserved category etc In the instant case there is nothing on record to show that the method of giving weightage to the candidates was not followed in respect of reserved category candidates even if they had not applied for the post in the reserved seats There is also nothing on record to show whether any candidate belonging to the reserved category had applied for a particular post in a reserved seat without the prior knowledge that the post was reserved This being the case since <ORG> and now this <ORG> has taken the view that the interpretation placed on the provisions of law by the <ORG> in <NAME> case was erroneous it will have to be held that the ap pointments made by the <ORG> on March pursuant to that decision were not according to law The rule of audi alterem partem does not apply in such cass and therefore there is no breach of the principles of natural justice It is recommended on compassionate grounds that the <ORG> may take into consideration the relevant facts pertaining to each of the appellants and if it is possible accommodate them without transgressing the law and the claim of other eligible candi dates The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The two questions raised in this appeal are i Whether the employment notice issued by the respondent <ORG> on July ought to have indicated reserva tions postwise and ii Whether assuming that the said notice was invalid the termination of services of the appellants on April was valid It appears that while recommending the selections the committees also gave weightage to the candidates belonging to the reserved castes <ORG> accepting this contention quashed the employment notice and set aside the appointments to the posts which were challenged in those petitions It may be mentioned here that although the services were thus terminated by the said order the Vice Chancellor on the same day issued another order in exercise of his emergency powers under Section of the Act and appointed all the appellants and others to the same posts protecting their pay and allowances at the same time making it clear that the appointments were temporary whether the general reservation instead of the postwise reservation was illegal there was a difference of opinion between two Division Benches of <ORG> However thereafter by the the consent of parties one more issue was raised before <ORG> which is the second of the two questions which we have to decide in this appeal viz The result was that the candidates belonging to the reserved category in particular who wanted to apply for the reserved posts did not know for which of the posts they could apply and whether they could apply at a for the posts in the subjects in which they were qualified The contention advanced on behalf of the appel lants that the selection committees even without know wheth er the posts concerned were reserved or not had given weightage to the candidates from the reserved category and therefore it cannot be said that any injustice had resulted to them is without merit The possibility that many eligible candidates belonging to both reserved and unreserved categories might not have taken the risk and chosen to gamble cannot be ruled out This argument further ignores the fact that the suitability of a candidate from a reserved category to the particular post has to be adjudged by taking into consideration various factors and the desired result cannot be obtained by merely giving uniform weightage marks to the candidates concerned which was the only method followed by the selection committees while selecting the candidates Further there is nothing on record to show that this method of giving weightage to the candidate was not followed in respect of reserved category candidates even if they had not applied for the post in the What is more there is also nothing on record to show wheth er any candidates belonging to the reserved category has applied for a particular post in a reserved seat without the prior knowledge that the post was reserved But of the posts were set apart although the candidates were selected for them and they were so set apart for being filled in afresh by candidates belonging to the reserved category A support was also sought to be derived by the appel lants to their contention from the policy of reservation as enunciated in <ORG> Resolution dated March wherein instructions were issued in the matter in exercise of the power conferred on the <ORG> under Section of the Act If even after readver tising the posts three times suitable candidates belonging to the reserved category do not become available they may be filled in by candidates belonging to the open category It is common knowledge that the vacancies in posts in different subjects occur from time to time according to the exigencies of the circumstances and they arise unequally in different posts This however does not absolve the appointing authority from advertising in advance the vacancies in each post and the number of posts in such vacancies meant for the reserved category and inviting applications from the candidates belonging to the reserved and unreserved categories with a clear statement in that behalf But an exception could possibly be made in cases like the one of professors in which post available in each of the subjects is only one while grouping all of them together for purposes of reservation so that at least in the subjects in which the candidates belonging to the reserved category are available they could be accommodated It is not necessary for us in this case to express our opinion on the correct course to be adopted when only one post is available in a particular subject at a given time The course to be adopted would depend upon the unit of reservations the period over which the backlog is to be carried the number of appointments already made in the said posts the availability of candi dates from the reserved category etc The contention is that since the provisions of that section give power to the Chancellor to terminate the services of a teacher only if he is satisfied that the appointment was not in accord ance with the law at that time in force and since the law at that time in force viz This being the case since the Full Bench and now this Court has taken the view that the interpretation placed on the provisions of law by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra was erroneous it will have to be held that the appointments made by the <ORG> on March pursuant to the law laid down in <NAME> case supra were not according to law The rule of audi altrem partem does not apply in such cases and therefore there is no breach of the principles of natural justice we are of the view that there is no merit in this case However it is pointed out to us that some of the appellants had resigned from their earlier jobs and joined the <ORG> some of them have become overaged for making any fresh application while others will have no chance either because the posts as per the new advertisement of are either reserved or non reserved and they belong to the other category We can therefore only recommend that the <ORG> may take into consideration the relevant facts pertaining to each of the appellants and if it is possible accommodate them without transgressing the law and the claims of other eligible candidates
