Upon receipt of such application <ORG> may if it thinks fit call for the relevant records and other information from <ORG> and after considering any explanation that may be offered by <ORG> cancel the order of <ORG> or revise it in such manner as <ORG> may deem just and proper On an application for review made by one of the respondents under of the Rules <ORG> without giving the appellant an opportunity of being heard cancelled the leases with regard to two of the areas and directed <ORG> to grant leases in respect thereof to the said respondent The Single judge who heard the application as well as <ORG> on appeal held that the order of cancellation was an administrative order and the appellant was not entitled to a hearing It was contended on behalf of the appellant in this Court that rr The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal upon a certificate granted by <ORG> raises the question whether an order of <ORG> under of the Mineral Concession Rules hereinafter called the Rules framed under of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act No of hereinafter called the Act is quasi judicial or administrative Some defects were pointed out in these applications and therefore the appellant submitted fresh applications on September after removing the defects In the meantime the third respondent also made applications for mining leases for manganese for the same area on July It was therefore asked on September to send a separate application in the prescribed form for each block and thereupon it submitted fresh applications on September It was held that the appellant applications were prior and therefore the leases were granted to him He was however informed on July by <ORG> of the order passed by <ORG> on January by which the lease granted to him by the State of Orissa with respect to two areas was cancelled Consequently he made an application under Art The writ petition was heard by a learned Single Judge of <ORG> and it was held that the order was not a quasi judicial order but merely an administrative one and that there being no lis the appellant was not entitled to a hearing The appellant went up in <ORG> to a Division Bench of <ORG> which upheld the order of the learned Single Judge The appellant then applied for a certificate to permit him to appeal to this Court which was granted and that is how the matter has come up before us <NAME> appearing on behalf of the appellant contends that <ORG> was acting in a quasi judicial capacity when it passed the order under of the Rules and therefore it was incumbent upon it to hear the appellant before deciding the review application and inasmuch as it did not do so it contravened the principles of natural justice which apply in such a case and the order is liable to be quashed to of the Rules which are relevant for the purpose clearly show that the proceeding before <ORG> is a quasi judicial proceeding in view of the following circumstances appearing from these rules Rule gives a statutory right to any person aggrieved by an order of <ORG> to apply for review in case of refusal of a mining lease It also prescribes a period of limitation namely two months Rule prescribes a fee for an application under created as soon as a person aggrieved by an order is given the right to go up in review against another person in whose favour the order has been passed by <ORG> show that the proceeding before <ORG> at any rate at the stage Of review is quasi judicial to which rules of natural justice apply No person applying for a mining lease of such minerals has any right to the grant of the lease He submits that even under which deals with priority the <ORG> Government is not bound to grant the lease to the person who applies first and it can for any special reason and with the prior approval of <ORG> grant it to a person who applies later Rule inter alia provides that any person aggrieved by an order of the <ORG> Government refusing to grant a mining lease may within two months of the date of such order apply to <ORG> for reviewing the same Rule may be quoted in extenso Upon receipt of such application <ORG> may if it thinks fit call for the relevant records and other information from the <ORG> Government and after considering any explanation that may be offered by the <ORG> Government cancel the order of the <ORG> Government or revise it in such manner as <ORG> may deem just and proper This definition insists on three requisites each of which must be fulfilled in order that the act of the body may be a quasi judicial act namely that the body of persons must have legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and must have the duty to act judicially disputes arising out of a claim made by any party under the statute which claim is opposed by another party and to determine the respective rights of the contesting parties who are opposed to each other there is a lis and prima facie and in the absence of anything in the statute to the contrary it is the duty of the authority to act judicially and the decision of the authority is a quasi judicial act and ii that if a statutory authority has power to do any act which will prejudicially affect the subject then although there are not two parties apart from the authority and the contest is between the authority proposing to do the act and the subject opposing it the final determination of the authority will yet be a quasi judicial act provided the authority is required by the statute to act judicially We have however to see what the position is after the <ORG> has granted a lease to one of the applicants before it and has refused the lease to others Mr <NAME> contends that even in such a situation there is no right in favour of the person to whom the lease has been granted by <ORG> till <ORG> has passed an order on a review application if any It would not therefore be in our opinion right to say that no right of any kind is created in favour of a person to whom the lease is granted by <ORG> It gives power to <ORG> to act only when there is an application for review before it under That is why we have not accepted Mr <NAME> argument that in substance <ORG> order becomes effective only after it is confirmed does not support this We have not found any provision in the Rules or in the Act which gives any power to <ORG> to review suo motu the order of <ORG> granting a lease In April the appellant was put in possession of the areas granted to him and actually worked them thereafter At any rate when the statutory rule grants a right to any party aggrieved to make a review application to <ORG> it certainly follows that the person in whose favour the order is made has also a right to represent his case before the authority to whom the review application is made Unless therefore there is anything in the statute to the contrary it will be the duty of the authority to act judicially and its decision would be a quasi judicial act The next question is whether there is anything in the Rules which negatives the duty to act judicially by the reviewing authority Mr <NAME> urges that gives full power to <ORG> to act as it may deem I just and proper and that it is not bound even to call for the relevant records and other information from <ORG> before deciding an application for review The fact that <ORG> is not bound even to call for records again does not negative the duty cast upon it to act judicially for even courts have the power to dismiss appeals without calling for records We are therefore of opinion that there is prima facie a lis in this case as between the person to whom the lease has been granted and the person who is aggrieved by the refusal and therefore Prima facie it is the duty of the authority which has to review the matter to act judicially and there is nothing in to the contrary In as much as this was not done the appellant is entitled to ask us to issue a writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the order of January passed by <ORG> We therefore allow the appeal and setting aside the order of <ORG> quash the order of <ORG> passed on January It will however be open to <ORG> to proceed to decide the review application afresh after giving a reasonable opportunity to the appellant to represent his case The appellant will get his costs throughout from the third respondent who is the principal contesting party
