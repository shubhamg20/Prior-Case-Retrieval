This is an application for a writ of certiorari to quash a notice issued under Section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and for a direction prohibiting the revenue from taking any proceeding in terms of the notice By notice dated th January under Section of the Act the Income tax Officer Ward opposite party No issued a notice to the petitioner to the following effect Whereas I have reason to believe that your income chargeable to tax for the assessment year has escaped assessment within the meaning of Section of the Income tax Act I therefore propose to reassess the income for the said assessment year and I hereby require you to deliver to me within days from the date of service of this notice a return in the prescribed form of your income assessable for the said assessment year This notice is being issued after obtaining the necessary satisfaction of <ORG> It is not known as to when and where the interview took place but on May the petitioner applied to the Income tax Officer for copies of a number of documents including records reports orders initiating the proceeding under Section of the Act the correspondence between the Income tax Officer and the superior officers of the revenue in the matter of reopening of the assessment reasons recorded for the initiation of the proceeding the sanction by <ORG> for the reopening and instructions from <ORG> if any in this connection Ultimately the petitioner came before this court asking for quashing of the proceeding and contended inter alia i Petitioner had disclosed all material facts and made no omission or failure to disclose fully and truly any of them when he had made the return in due course and after consideration of all primary and material facts the Income tax Officer had made the order of assessment under Section of the old Act Therefore there was no justification for initiating the proceeding iii The conditions precedent to the initiation of the proceeding namely the Income tax Officer must have reason to believe that the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax had been under assessed and he must have reason to believe either of omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return of his income or omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the relevant assessment having not been satisfied the notice itself is untenable in law Before the inquiry commission evidence was led by one <NAME> in support of the story that lakhs of rupees had been paid to the assessee in respect of kendu leaf deals The Income tax Officer averred in his counter affidavit that the afore said fresh evidence was prima facie material in his possession which led him to hold that there had been under assessment With regard to the accord of sanction by <ORG> it has been pleaded in paragraph of the counter affidavit The sanction order of <ORG> has not been correctly quoted by the petitioner at page of the writ petition and the approval order has been given after due consideration of the materials on the records and is in accordance with the requirements of the law and is within the jurisdiction and it has not been given mechanically without application of mind as asserted in the writ petition but was given with due application of the mind and there is material to show that income chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment is likely to exceed Rs In the counter affidavit itself there is an admission that when the normal assessment was completed detailed enquiries had been made the Income tax Officer had obtained information on all the aspects which are now made the basis for reopening of the proceeding We may now refer to the report of the Income tax Officer appended to the recording of reasons by him which is a part of the counter affidavit Therein categorical reference has been made to this amount of Rs In reply he stated that obviously with the position held by him he could not go personally for the purchase of those certificates and it was also not safe to entrust any of his employees with such heavy sums in cash for the purchase of these certificates lest they decamped with the money In annexure it has been stated I also questioned him about some of the cheques issued by him for purchase of building materials and he stated that they were for <ORG> and for <ORG> party meetings was collected from all the kendu leaf traders by <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> and this amount was paid to Dr <NAME> at his Ekambra Nivas residence This payment was made to Dr <NAME> a few days after the order for remission was passed Section of the Act provides If a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return under Section for any assessment year to the Income tax Officer or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in Clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may subject to the provisions of Sections to assess or reassess such income or recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance as the case may be for the assessment year concerned hereafter in Sections to referred to as the relevant assessment year The Income tax Officer as would appear from his letter annexure addressed to the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner indicated that he had applied his mind and was prepared to accept the explanation of the assessee It postulates a duty on every assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment In every assessment proceeding the assessing authority will for the purpose of computing or determining the proper tax due from an assessee require to know all the facts which help him in coming to the correct conclusion Facts asserted in support of the objection have been refuted It is however claimed by learned standing counsel that as appeals and references are provided under the statute when assessments are completed there is alternative remedy available and this application therefore must be declared to have abated The question of alternative remedy has to be examined with reference to the present dispute If there is any remedy provided under the Income tax Act where the assessee can have the notice under Section vacated that alone would constitute alternative remedy We allow the writ application quash the notice under Section of the Act and direct that a writ of prohibition be issued to the opposite parties from acting in furtherance of the notice
