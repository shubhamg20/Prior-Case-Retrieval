Under such application could be made at any time The petitioners a group of contract carriage operators who were denied permits that they had applied for under ss and of the Motor Vehicles Act in view of the provisions of ss and of the Karnataka Contract Car riages Acquisition Act filed writ petitions under Article of the Constitution questioning the action of the A It was contended that the provisions of ss and of the Karnataka Act were in direct conflict with the provi sions of ss and of the Act in as much as while <<NAME>RG> was enjoined by the said provisions of the Act ordinarily not to refuse to grant an application for permit of any kind the said provisions of the Karnataka Act prohibited any person from applying for and any officer or authority from entertaining or granting application for running any contract carriage in the <<NAME>RG> that since the Act was a later legis lation operating in the same area it should be deemed to have impliedly repealed the provisions of ss and of the Karnataka Act even if the latter Act had received the assent of the President in view of the proviso to sub clause of Article of the Constitution that when there is a repugnancy under Article of the Constitution the doctrine of pith and substance does not apply and even if some of the provisions of the <<NAME>RG> Legislation are in conflict with some of the provisions of the Central legisla tion the conflicting provisions of the <<NAME>RG> legislation will be invalid and that therefore their applications under ss and were maintainable without reference to the provisions of the Karnataka Act <NAME>n the question Whether there is repugnancy between the provisions of ss and of the Karnataka Contract Car riages Acquisition Act and ss and of the Motor Vehicles Act and whether the doctrine of domi nant purpose and pith and substance is applicable while examining the repugnancy of the two statutes Per <NAME> <NAME> Concurring with <NAME> <NAME> There is no direct inconsistency between the Karnata ka Contract Carriages Acquisition Act and the Motor Vehicles Act A Repugnancy between two statutes would arise if there is direct conflict between the two provisions and if the law made by <<NAME>RG> and the law made by <<NAME>RG> occupy the same field Section of the <<NAME>RG>ary Act does contain a liberalised provision in the matter of grant of permits but even then there again the ancillary provision contained in of the <<NAME>RG> Act to effectuate acquisition does not directly run counter to the provision There is no repugnancy in the provisions of ss and of the Karnataka Contract Carriages Acquisition Act and ss and of the Motor Vehicles Act he legislation are thus different then merely because the two legislations refer to some allied or cognate subjects they do not cover the same field A provision in one legislation to give effect to its dominant purpose may incidentally be on the same subject as covered by the provision of the other legislation The very fact that instead the <<NAME>RG> undertook the exercise of enacting the Karnataka Act shows that the object of <<NAME>RG> in enacting it was materially different i to nationalise the contract carriage services in the <<NAME>RG> with a view to provide better transport facilities to the public and also to prevent concentration of wealth in the hands of the few and to utilise the resources of the country to subserve the interests of all There is no difference in the legal consequences of the schemes under the two enactments Section of the MV Act in terms clearly states as did Section of the MV Act that Chapter VI relating to the special provisions about the <<NAME>RG> Trans port Undertaking and the rules<NAME> and orders made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in Chapter or in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law Hence it cannot be said that there was a conflict between the provisions of the Karnataka Act and the Act the <<NAME>RG> and the <<NAME>RG> List by examining the dominant purpose and therefore the pith and substance of the two legislations there is no reason why the repugnancy under Article of the Constitution between the provisions of the two legislations under different entries in the same List viz The <<NAME>RG> and the legislature of a <<NAME>RG> derive their exclusive power to legislate on a subject subjects in List I and List II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution from Art posits as a rule that in case of repugnancy or inconsistency between the <<NAME>RG> Law and the <<NAME>RG> Law relating to the same matter in the Concurrent List occupying the same field the <<NAME>RG> law shall prevail and the <<NAME>RG> law will fail to the extent of the repugnancy or inconsistency whether the <<NAME>RG> law is prior or later in point of time to the <<NAME>RG> law provided the <<NAME>RG> law is reserved for consideration of the President and it has received his assent and then it will prevail in that <<NAME>RG> notwithstanding its repugnancy or inconsistency with the <<NAME>RG> law This exception again is to be read subject to the proviso to cl thereof which empowers the <<NAME>RG> to make law afresh or repeal or amend modify or vary the repugnant <<NAME>RG> law and it became void even though it received President<NAME>s assent The question of repugnancy under Article of the Constitution arises when the provisions of both laws are fully inconsistent or are absolutely irreconcilable and it is impossible to obey without disobeying the other or conflicting results are produced when both the statutes covering the same field are applied to a given set of facts It matters little whether the provisions fall under one or other entry in the Concurrent List The proper test is whether effect can be given to the provisions of both the laws or whether both the laws can stand together It also confers the right on an applicant to apply for and authorises <<NAME>RG> to grant liberally contract carriage permit except in the area covered by and refusal appears to be an exception that too obviously for reasons to be recorded The Act and the relevant rules cover the entire field of making an applica tion in the prescribed manner and directs <<NAME>RG> to grant permit with condition attached thereto to run contract carriages vide ss and But unless it again enacts law and reserves it for consideration and obtains the assent of the President afresh there is no prohibition for the petitioners to make applications for the grant of contract carriage permits under the Act and consideration and grant or refusal thereof according to law by the concerned Regional Transport Author ity The Karnataka <<NAME>RG> <ORG> is therefore at liberty to make afresh the law similar to ss and of the Acquisition Act with appropriate phraseology and to obtain the assent of the President For the applicability of the principle that special law prevails over the general law the special law must be valid law in operation A The doctrine has no application when the matter in question is covered by an entry or entries in the Concurrent List and has occupied the same field both in the <<NAME>RG> and the <<NAME>RG> Law The <<NAME>RG> and <ORG> of the <<NAME>RG> have exclusive power to legislate upon any subject or subjects in the Concurrent List The following Judgments of the Court were delivered <NAME> I have the benefit of reading the judgment prepared by my esteemed brethren <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> Brother <NAME> has taken the view that of the Karnataka Act has not become void with the enforce ment of the Motor Vehicles Act while Brother <NAME> has come to the contrary conclusion Agreeing with the conclusion of <NAME> I have not found it possible to concur with <NAME> Since an interesting question has arisen and in looking to the two judgments I have found additional reasons to support the conclusion of <NAME> ancillary or subservient thereto and the preamble stated Whereas contract carriages and certain other categories of public service vehicles are being operated in the State in a matter highly detrimental and prejudicial to public interest And whereas with a view to prevent such misuse and also to provide better facilities for the transport of passengers by road and to give effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment And whereas for the aforesaid purposes it is considered necessary to provide for the acquisition of contract carriages and certain other categories of public service vehicles in the <ORG> and for matters incidental ancillary or subservient thereto Section contains the declaration to the following effect It is hereby declared that this Act is for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in clauses and of Article of the Con stitution of India and the acquisition therefore of the contract carriages and other property referred to in section Section gave the <ORG> the exclusive privilege of running contract carriages within the State to the exclusion of any provision under the Act The Court took note of the fact that even though it may have had some incidental impact on inter State trade or commerce it did not suffer from any lacuna on that count Sections and contain the relevant provisions in this regard While provides for an application for such permit contains the procedure for the consideration of the grant and contains a general provision that the transport authority shall not ordinarily refuse to grant an application for permit of any kind made at any time under the Act Section of the Government of India Act contained the provision to deal with such a situation The Article reads thus If any provision of a law made by the <ORG> of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of any existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the <ORG> of such State or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the <ORG> of the State shall to the extent of the repug nancy be void Where a law made by <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concur rent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the Legis lature of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by <ORG> State Though for some time there was difference of judicial opinion as to in what situation Art The consideration of the present question has to be within the ambit of cl as the <ORG> law is the earlier legislation and the Parliamentary Act of came later and it is contended that the <ORG> legislation has provisions repugnant to provisions made in the Act There can be no controversy that if there is repugnancy the Parliamen tary legislation has to prevail and the law made by the <ORG> Legislature to the extent of repugnancy becomes void There is unanimity at the <ORG> that the Motor Vehicles Act is a legislation coming within Entry of the Concurrent List If the later legislation deals not with the matters which formed the subject of the earlier legisla tion but with other and distinct matters though of a cognate and allied character then Art of the Reports it has been said It would be seen that so far as clause of Article is concerned it clearly lays down that where there is a direct collision between a provision of a law made by the <ORG> and that made by <ORG> with respect of one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the <ORG> law would be void to the extent of the repugnancy both <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislatures are entitled to legislate in regard to any of the Entries appearing therein but that is subject to the condition laid down by Article discussed above It is therefore obvious that in such matters repugnancy may result from the following circumstances inconsistent Emphasis added and are absolutely irreconcilable the Central Act will prevail and the State Act will become void in view of the repugnancy Where however a law passed by the <ORG> comes into collision with a law passed by <ORG> on an Entry in the Concurrent List the <ORG> Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act would become void provided the <ORG> Act has been passed in accordance with clause or Article Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law fails within the four corners of the State List and en trenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential Where however a law made by <ORG> on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law made by <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Article of the Constitution The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the <ORG> Act is concerned it will prevail in the <ORG> and overrule the provisions of the Central Act in its applicability to the <ORG> only Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amending varying or repealing the law made by <ORG> under the provision to Article There is no clear authority in support of the stand of the petitioners where the <ORG> law is under one head of legislation in the Concurrent List the subsequent <ORG> legislation is under another head of legislation in the same List and in the working of the two it is said to give rise to a question of repugnancy But as has been pointed out already there is no direct inconsistency between the two and on the facts placed in the case there is no necessary invitation to the application of cl of Art The precise question that falls for consideration therefore is whether there is a repugnancy between the two legislations To effectuate the said intention it was considered necessary to enact the legislation Section of the Act makes a declara tion in the following words It is hereby declared that this Act is for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clauses and of Article of the Con stitution of India and the acquisition therefor of the contract carriages and other property referred to in Section Section provided for payment of compensation for the acquisition of all the said property SCR this Court upheld the validity of the said Act holding among other things that the Act was for acquisition of property and was in the public interest and for a public purpose The very fact that instead the <ORG> undertook the exercise of enacting the Karnataka Act shows that the object of the <ORG> Legis lature in enacting it was materially different For this purpose it has made important provisions in the following matters namely a rationalisation of certain definitions with additions of certain new definitions of new types of vehicles Stricter procedures relating to grant of driving li cences and the period of validity thereof laying down of standards for the components and parts of motor vehicles standards for anti pollution control devices provision for issuing fitness certificates or vehicles also by the authorised testing stations enabling provision for updating the system of registra tion marks liberalised schemes for grant of stage carriage permits on non nationalised routes all <ORG> permits and also national permits for goods carriages i There is no difference in the legal consequences of the schemes under the two enactments In any case there is no provision for liberalisation of the grant of contract carriage permits in favour of the private individuals or institutions so as to come in conflict with the Karnataka Act Hence the provisions of Article do not come into play in the present case and hence there is no question of repugnancy between the two legislations According to him while <ORG> <ORG> is enjoined by the provisions of Section read with Section of the MV Act ordinarily not to refuse to grant an application for permit of any kind the provisions of Section and of the Karnataka Act prohibit any person from applying for and any officer or authority from enter taining or granting application for running any contract carriage in the State Thus there is a direct conflict between the two legislations and since the MV Act is a later legislation operating in the same area it should be deemed to have impliedly repealed the provisions of Section and of the Karnataka Act even if the latter Act had received the assent of the President This contention proceeds on the footing that the two legislations occupy the same field Section of the MV Act in terms clearly states as did Section of the MV Act that Chapter VI relating to the special provi sions about <ORG> and the rules and orders made thereunder shall have effect notwithstand ing anything inconsistent therewith contained in Chapter or in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law Hence it is not correct to say that there is a conflict between the provisions of the two Acts It was then contended that when there is a repugnancy between the legislations under Article of the Constitu tion the doctrine of pith and substance does not apply and even if some of the provisions of the impugned State legis lation are in conflict with some of the provisions of the Central legislation the conflicting provisions of the State legislation will be invalid In that case the validity of the Punjab Restitution of Mortgage Lands Act was challenged on the ground that some of its provisions were repugnant to certain provisions of the Contract Act and of the Civil Procedure Code The <ORG> held that there was no repugnancy between the legislations But while holding so the <ORG> made a one sentence observation as follows In the judgment of <ORG> there is some discussion of the question of the pith and substance of the Act but that question does not arise as objection is taken not under Section of the Constitution act but Sec There is no discussion on the point The observation further was not necessary for the decision in that case since as is pointed out above the <ORG> had held that there was no repugnancy between the two statutes since they cov ered two different subject matters Even otherwise I am of the view that not to apply the theory of pith and substance when the repugnancy between the two statutes is to be considered under Article of the Constitution would be illogical when the same doctrine is applied while considering whether there is an encroachment by the <ORG> or the <ORG> legislature or a subject exclu sively reserved for the other the <ORG> and the <ORG> List by examining the dominant purpose and therefore the pith and substance of the two legisla tions there is no reason why the repugnancy between the provisions of the two legislations under different entries in the same List viz SCR this Court had to consider the repugnancy between the presolution passed by the appellant <ORG> in exercise of the powers vested in it under Section and of the Travancore District Municipalities Act and the provisions of Section of the Travancore Cochin Motor Vehicles Act which came into force on January providing for the use of a public bus stand constructed for Stage Carriage buses starting from and returning to the Municipal limits or passing through its limits That Section read as follows Government or any authority authorised in this behalf by Government may in consultation with the local authority having jurisdiction in the area concerned determine places at which motor vehicles may stand either indefinitely or for a specified period of time and may determine the places at which public service vehicles may stop for a longer time than is necessary for the taking up and setting down of passengers This <ORG> further observed that in that case <ORG> was concerned with the statutes which covered more or less the same subject matter and had the same object to serve That decision further had kept open the question whether the powers conferred upon one authority by an earli er Act could continue to be exercised by that authority after the enactment of a provision in a subsequent law which conferred wide powers on another authority which would include some of the powers conferred by the earlier statute till the new authority chose to exercise the powers con ferred upon it The <ORG> then went on to say that it is undoubtedly true that the legislature can exercise the powers of repeal by implication but it is an equally well settled principle of law that there is a pre sumption against an implied repeal Upon the assumption that the legislature enacts laws with a complete knowledge of all existing laws pertaining to the same subject the failure to acid a repealing clause indicates that the intent was not to repeal existing legislation The <ORG> then referred to the observations made in <NAME> <NAME> Calif The said observations are as follows As laws are presumed to be passed with deliberation and with full knowledge of all existing ones on the same sub ject it is but reasonable to conclude that the <ORG> in passing a statute did not intend to interfere with or abrogate any former law relating to the same matter unless the repugnancy between the two is irreconcilable The <ORG> in this connection quoted the following passage at page from <NAME> And as we have already suggested it is essential that the new statute covers the entire subject matter of the old otherwise there is no indication of the intent of the legis lature to abrogate the old law The <ORG> then stated that the third question to be considered was whether the new statute purports to replace the old one in its entirety or only partially and the <ORG> observed that where replacement of an earlier statute is partial a question like the one which the <ORG> did not choose to answer in <NAME> case supra would arise for decision The <ORG> also stated that it has to be remembered that at the basis of the doctrine of implied repeal is the presumption that the legislature which must be deemed to know the existing law did not intend to create any confusion in the law by retaining conflicting provi sions on the statute book and therefore when the court applies this doctrine it does no more than give effect to the intention of the legislature ascertained by it in the usual way i by examining the scope and the object of the two enactments the earlier and the later SCR and pointed out that in that case the following principles were laid down to ascertain whether there is repugnancy or not Whether there is direct conflict between the two provi sions The <ORG> however hastened to add that there is no rule of law to prevent repeal of special and local statute by a later general statute and therefore where the provisions of the special statute are wholly repugnant to the general statute it would be possible to infer that the special statute was repealed by the general enactment After discussing the principles of repugnancy as above the <ORG> answered the question that fell for consideration before it in favour of <ORG> by observing as follows It seems to us however clear that bearing in mind the fact that the provisions of of the Travancore Cochin Motor Vehicles Act were intended to apply to a much wider area than those of ss and of the Travancore District Municipalities Act it cannot be said that was intended to replace those provisions of the Travancore Distt The result of this undoubtedly would be that a provision which is added subsequently that is which represents the latest will of the legislature will have an overriding effect on the earlier provision in the sense that despite the fact that some action has been taken by <ORG> by resorting to the earlier provision the appropri ate authority may nevertheless take action under of the Travancore Cochin Motor Vehicles Act the result of which would be to override the action taken by <ORG> under of the District Municipalities Act Municipalities Act and therefore it could not be said that the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act were intended to replace the provisions of Municipalities Act The <ORG> also rested the said decision by relying on the fact that since no action was taken by the <ORG> under the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehi cles Act till such time as the action was taken under the said provisions <ORG> could act under the provisions of the Municipalities Act What is important from our point of view is the view taken in that case that when repugnancy is alleged between the two statutes it is necessary to examine whether the two laws occupy the same field whether the new or the later statute covers the entire subject matter of the old whether legislature intended to lay down an exhaustive code in respect of the subject matter covered by the earlier law so as to replace it in its entirety and whether the earlier special statute can be construed as remaining in effect as a qualification of or exception to the later general law since the new statute is enacted knowing fully well the existence of the earlier law and yet it has not repealed it expressly It was further pro vided that in either of these two cases the suit may be instituted in a court having jurisdiction over the place at which the passenger or the goods were booked or the place of destination or over the place in which the destination station lies or the loss etc The Court took the view that in view of the fact that the provi sions of the new Section as well as the relevant provi sions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Presidency Small Causes Courts Act dealt with the same subject matter namely the forum for suits and since the new Section was a special provision relating to special suits against <ORG> the special provisions would prevail over the general provisions The Court also stated that Section looking into its earlier history and the other changes which were brought in it was a code in itself dealing with the relevant subject matter and therefore it repealed the provisions of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure and of Section of the Presidency Small Causes Courts Act by necessary implication The provisions with regard to application and grant of permits in Sections and have nothing in common with the provisions of Sections and of the Motor Vehicles Act Since further the <ORG> had enacted the later statute knowing fully well the existence of the earlier statute and yet it did not expressly repeal it it will be presumed that the <ORG> felt that there was no need to repeal the said statute <ORG> SCR what fell for consideration was the alleged repugnancy between the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Act and two Notifications issued by the <ORG> Government under it on September and November on the one hand and Industries Development Regulation Act and the Essential Commodities Act and the Sugar Cane Control Order issued under it on the other The Court has stated there that no question of repug nancy under Article of the Constitution can arise where <ORG>ary legislation and <ORG> legislation occupy different fields and deal with separate and distinct matters even though of a cognate and allied nature and whereas in that case there was no inconsistency in the actual terms of the Act enacted by <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislature the test of repugnancy would be whether <ORG>ary and the <ORG> Legislature in legislating under an Entry in the Concurrent List exercised their powers over the same subject matter or whether the laws enacted by <ORG> were intended to be exhaustive so as to cover the entire field on the subject which are as follows It is sometimes said that two laws cannot be said to be properly repugnant unless there is a direct conflict between them as when one says do and the other don there is no true repugnancy according to this view if it is possible to obey both the laws The principle deducible from the English cases as from the Canadian cases seems therefore to be the same as that enunciated by <NAME> in the Australian hours case CLR if the dominant law has expressly or impliedly evinced its intention to cover the whole field then a subordinate law in the same field is repugnant and therefore inoperative Referring to the case in hand the <ORG> then stated that there was no question of any inconsistency in the actual terms of the two Acts The only questions that arose there were whether the <ORG> and <ORG> sought to exercise their powers over the same subject matter or whether the laws enacted by <ORG> were intended to be a complete exhaustive code or in other words expressly or impliedly evinced an intention to cover the whole field Thus the fields of operation of the two legislations were different and hence there was no repugnancy between the Central Act and the <ORG> Act It was also further pointed out there that even assuming that sugar cane was an article or class of articles relatable to the sugar industry within the meaning of Section of the Central Act no order was issued by <ORG> in exer cise of the powers vested in it under that Section and hence no question of repugnancy could ever arise because repugnancy must exist in fact and not depend merely on a possibility That however did not affect the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact the law in regard to sugar cane and the only question which had to be considered was whether there was any repugnancy between the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act and the <ORG> legislation in that behalf Likewise the provision contained in Section of the <ORG> Act in regard to the payment of sugar cane price as fixed by <ORG> There was no repugnancy whatever between those provisions and neither the <ORG> Act nor the rules flamed thereunder as well as <ORG> Order issued under it trenched upon the field covered by the Essential Commodities Act The <ORG> therefore held that since there was no repugnancy between the two the provi sions of Article of the Constitution did not come into play The contention advanced on behalf of <ORG> was that under the proviso to Article the power to repeal a law passed by <ORG> was incidental to enacting a law relating to the same matter as is dealt with in the State legislation and that a statute which merely repeals a law passed by <ORG> without enacting substantive provisions on the subject would not be within the proviso as it could not have been the intention of the Constitution that on a topic within the concurrent sphere of the legislation there should be a vaccum The Court observed that there was considerable force in the said contention and there was much to be said for the view that a repeal simpliciter was not within the scope of the proviso The Court however stated that it was not necessary to give its decision on the said point as the petitioner in that case would fail on another ground The Court then observed that while the proviso to Article does confer on <ORG> a power to repeal a law passed by <ORG> that power is under the terms of the proviso subject to certain limitations It is limited to enacting a law with respect to the same matter adding to amending varying or repealing a law so made by <ORG> The impugned Act was not a law relating to any matter which is the subject of an earlier legislation by <ORG> To such a law the proviso had no application and Section of Act of and clause of the Sugar Cane Control Order must in this view be held to be invalid If the subject matters covered by the legislations are thus different then merely because the two legislations refer to some allied or cognate subjects they do not cover the same field A provision in one legis lation to give effect to its dominant purpose may inciden tally be on the same subject as covered by the provision of the other legislation In this view of the matter I am of the view that there is no repugnancy in the provisions of Sections and of the Karnataka Act and Sections and of the MV Act It was reserved for consideration and has received the assent of the President on March It came into force with effect from March Section de fines public place to mean a road street way or other place whether a thoroughfare or not to which the public have a right of access and includes any place or stand at which passengers are picked up or set down by a stage car riage Section defines public service vehicle to mean any motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward and includes a Chapter deals with Control of Transport Vehicles mandates an owner of a motor vehicle to obtain permit to run it in accordance with the conditions of a permit thus No owner of a motor vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passen gers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by <ORG> or any prescribed authority authorising him the use of the vehicle in that place in the manner in which the vehicle is being used Sub thereof provides that subject to provisions of sub <ORG> may on an appli cation made to it under grant a contract carriage permit in accordance with the application or with such modifications as it deems fit or refuse to grant such a permit provided that no such permit shall be granted in respect of any area not specified in the application Under an application for a permit of any kind may be made at any time Sub posits that <ORG> shah not ordinarily refuse to grant an application for permit of any kind made at any time under this Act The petitioners have applied under ss and of the Act for grant of contract carriage permits The argument of Mr <NAME> though apparently at first blush is alluring and attractive but on a deeper probe I find insurmountable difficulties in his way to give accept ance to them At the cost of repetition it may be stated that ss to and the relevant rules under the Repealed Act govern the grant of contract carriage permits and in partic ular the rigour imposed in thereof is absent in the Act Sections and read with of the Act gives to an applicant the right to apply for and to obtain and obligates <ORG> to grant permit to run any public serv ice vehicle as contract carriage throughout the country including the State of Karnataka Clause adumbrates that the existing law if it is repug nant with the law made by the <ORG> subject to the provisions of cl the law made by the <ORG> wheth er passed before or after the law made by the <ORG> of such state or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the <ORG> of the State shall to the extent of repug nancy be void Clause deals with the law made by <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by the <ORG> or an existing one with respect to that matter then the law so made by the <ORG> of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the Presi dent and has received his assent prevails in that State provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parlia ment from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by the <ORG> of the State At times the citizen sub jected to both of laws Central and <ORG> will find incon sistency between the obligations imposed on him by those laws or finds variance to avail both laws However paramouncy has been accorded to the <ORG> Law making provision in Art firstly as to what would happen in case of repugnancy between the Central and the <ORG> law in the concurrent field and secondly resolving such a con flict The reason is that there are certain matters which cannot be allocated exclusively either to the <ORG> or to a <ORG> Legislature and for which though often it is desirable that the <ORG> Legislature should make a provision in that regard It is equally necessary that the <ORG> should also have plenary jurisdiction to enable it in some cases to secure uniformity in the main principles of law throughout the country or in other matters to guide and encourage the <ORG>s efforts and to provide remedies for mischiefs arising in the <ORG> sphere extending or liable to extent beyond the boundaries of a single <ORG> The <ORG> has to examine in each case whether both the legislations or the relevant provisions therein occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and whether there exists repugnance between the two laws The emphasis laid by Art posits as a rule that in case of repugnancy or inconsistency between the <ORG> law and the <ORG> law relating to the same matter in the Concurrent List occupying the same field the <ORG> law shall prevail and the <ORG> law will fail to the extent of the repugnancy or inconsistency whether the <ORG> law is prior or later in point of time to the <ORG> law provided the <ORG> law is reserved for con sideration of the President and it has received his assent and then it will prevail in that <ORG> notwithstanding its repugnancy or inconsistency with the <ORG> law This excep tion again is to be read subject to the proviso to cl thereof which empowers the <ORG> to make law afresh or repeal or amend modify or vary the repugnant <ORG> law which will become void even though it received President assent The premise is that the law made by the <ORG> is paramount and <ORG> and <ORG> law must relate to the same subject matter in the Concurrent List It is thus made clear that the <ORG> can always whether prior or subsequent to <ORG> law make a law occupied by the <ORG> law There is no repugnancy unless the two Acts or provi sions are wholly incompatible with each other or the two would lead to absurd result The proper test is whether the effect can be given to the provisions of both the laws or whether both the laws can stand together The reason is obvious that there is no provision in the Constitution that the law made by the <ORG> is to be void by reason of its inconsistency with the law made by <ORG> <ORG> It had received the assent of the Presi dent Before embarking upon an enquiry into the results produced by these provisions in the light of above discussion let us consider the relevant decisions and the ratio laid down therein in this context In that context it was held that if both <ORG> and <ORG> were entitled to legislature in regard to this subject of production supply and distribution of sugarcane there would arise no question of legislative competence of <ORG> in the matter of having enacted the impugned Act On a com parison of various provisions of the <ORG> and Central laws it was held that there was no question of any inconsistency in the actual terms of the Act enacted by the <ORG> and the impugned Act and they did not occupy the same field In considering schedule VII List I Entries and List II Entry and List III Entries and and the relevant provisions of the Stamp Act and its Schedules this Court held that the ques tion of repugnancy can only arise in respect of matters where both the parliament and the <ORG> <ORG> have competence to pass laws SCR relied on by Sri <NAME> the Uttar Pradesh legislature made Transport Service Development Act which had received the assent of the President introduced a scheme of nationalisation of the transport service <NAME> as he then was per majority while considering the question laid three propositions to determine the repugnancy thus Whether there is direct repugnancy between the two provi sions Whether <ORG> intended to lay down an ex haustive code in respect of the subject matter replacing the Act of the <ORG> <ORG> and Whether the law made by the <ORG> and the law made by the <ORG> <ORG> occupy the same field After examining in detail the provi sions of the respective Acts it was held that after the Central Amendment Act of it prevailed over the Act and prospectively became void as the Central Amend ment Act occupied the same field in respect of the same schemes initiated under the Amendment Act and to that extent the <ORG> Act must yield its place to the Central Act Meeting the argument as to on which Entry in the list the subject falls it was held thus If by reason of the declaration by <ORG> the entire subject matter of conversation and development of minerals has been taken over for being dealt with by <ORG> thus depriving the <ORG> of the power which it therefore pos sessed it would follow that the matter in the <ORG> List is to the extent of the declaration substracted from the scope of the declaration and ambit of Entry of the <ORG> List The person shall not be qualified for appoint ment as presiding officer of the <ORG> unless he is or has been a Judge of <ORG> or he has held the office of Chairman or any other member of the Labour Appellate <ORG> constituted under the Industrial Disputes Appel late <ORG> Act or of any <ORG> for a period of not less than two years Assam Act of made an amendment to the above procedure and had received the assent of the President introducing clause aa to sub section a of Section A thus He has worked as a District Judge or as an Additional District Judge or as both for a total period of not less than three years or is qualified for appointment as a Judge of <ORG> provided that the appointment to a Tribunal of any person qualified under this clause shall not be made without consultation with <ORG> The proper test is whether effect can be given to the provisions of both the laws or whether both the laws can stand together When questioned it was argued that there was no inconsistency between the award and the <ORG> Act because the employer it was said could obey both laws by observing the hours working week but on the basis that the pay scale determined by the award applied to the hours work ing week Statute may do more than impose duties they may for instance confer rights and one statute is inconsistent with another when it takes away a right conferred by the other even though the right may be one which might be waived or abandoned without disobeying the statute which conferred it If however a competent legislature expressly or im pliedly evinces its intention to cover the whole field that is a conclusive test of inconsistency where another legisla ture assumes to enter to any extent upon the same field If such a position as I have postulated be in fact estab lished the inconsistency is demonstrated not by comparison of detailed provisions but by the existence of the two sets of provisions where that wholesale inconsistency does not occur but the field in partly open then it is necessary to enquire further and possibly to examine and contrast partic ular provisions It is plain that it may be quite possible to obey both simply by not doing what is declared by either to be unlawful and yet there is palpably inconsistency Emphasis supplied In that case it was held that there is operational incompat ibility between the <ORG> award and the <ORG> law In <NAME> Attorney General Victoria CLR the Re establishment and Employment Act dealt with the obligations of employers to give preference to ex service men in employment but included no provision as to the duty to give preference in promotion to ex servicemen already employed In <NAME> State of Bombay SCR relied on by Sri <NAME> the facts were that of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act provides penalty for contravention of orders issued under for a term of three years or with fine or with both of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years but shall not except for reasons to be recorded in writing be less than six months and shall also be liable to fine If the later legislation deals not with the matters which formed the subject of the earlier legislation but with other and distinct matters though of a cognate and allied character then Art is that when there is legislation covering the same ground both by the <ORG> and by the Province both of them being competent to enact the same the law of the <ORG> should prevail over that of the <ORG> It was further held that though there is no express repeal even then the State law will be void under the proviso if it conflicts with later law with respect to the same matter that may be enacted by the <ORG> Where the provisions of the Central Act and a State Act in the Concurrent List are fully inconsistent and are absolute ly irreconciliable the Central Act will prevail and the State Act will become void in view of the repugnancy Where however a law passed by the State comes into colli sion with a law passed by <ORG> on an Entry in the Concurrent List the State Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act would become void provided the State Act has been passed in accordance with CI Where a law passed by <ORG> the entries in the <ORG> List entrenches upon any of the entries in the Central List the consitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine on a subject covered by the Concur rent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law made by the <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Art The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the <ORG> Act is concerned it will prevail in the <ORG> and overrule the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the <ORG> only Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amend ing varying or repealing the law made by the <ORG> Legisla ture under the proviso to Article Dealing with the question of repeal by implication it was held that there is no repeal by implication unless the inconsistency appears on the face of the two statutes that where two statutes occupy a particular field but there is a room or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming into collision with each other no repugnancy results and that where there is no inconsistency a statute occupying the same field seeks to create distinct and separate offence no question of repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same field It had received the assent of the President In considering the question whether the State Act became void <NAME> speaking for three Judges Bench has held thus There is no doubt or difficulty as to the law applicable of the Constitution makes provision firstly as to what would happen in the case of conflict between a Central and <ORG> Law with regard to the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List Clause lays down that if a <ORG> law relating to a concurrent subject is repugnant to a <ORG> law relating to that subject then whether the <ORG> law is prior or later in time the <ORG> law will prevail and the <ORG> law shall that if the President assents to a <ORG> law which has been reserved for his consideration it will prevail notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law of the <ORG> both laws dealing with a concurrent subject in short the result of obtaining the assent of the President to a <ORG> Act which is inconsistent with a previous <ORG> law relating to a concurrent subject would be that the <ORG> Act will pre vail in that <ORG> and override the provisions of the Cen tral Act in their applicability to that <ORG> only empowers the <ORG> <ORG> to repeal or amend a repugnant <ORG> law even though it has become valid by virtue of the President assent A <ORG> law would be repugnant to the <ORG> law when there is direct conflict between the two laws Such repug nancy may also arise where both laws operate in the same field and the two cannot possibly stand together where both prescribe punishment for the same offence but the punishment differs in degree or kind or in the procedure prescribed In all such cases the law made by <ORG> shall prevail over the <ORG> law under Art That being so when <ORG> stepped in and enacted the Central Amendment Act it being a latter law made by <ORG> with respect to the same matter the West Bengal Amendment Act stood impliedly repealed Repugnancy arises where there is a direct conflict or collision between the Central Act and the State Legislation and to the extent of repugnancy by necessary implication or by express reference the State legislation stands repealed which gives overriding power to the <ORG> to make any law or amend vary modify or repeal the law made by <ORG> the question of legislative competence of <ORG> does not arise since the <ORG> and the <ORG> of a State have undoubted power and jurisdiction to make law on a subject i in respect of that matter Repugnancy or inconsistency may arise in diverse ways which are only illustrative and not exhaustive i There may be direct repugnancy between the two provi sions ii <ORG> may evince its intention to cover the whole same field by laying down an exhaustive code in respect thereof displacing the State Act provision or provisions in that Act The Act of the <ORG> may be either earlier or subsequent to the State law iii Inconsistency may be demonstrated not necessarily by a detailed comparison of the provisions of the two pieces of law but by their very existence in the statutes iv Occupying the same field operational incompatibility irreconcilability or actual collision in their operation in the same territory by the Act provision or provisions of the Act made by the <ORG> and their counter parts in a State law are some of the true tests Intention of the <ORG> to occupy the same field held by <ORG> may not be expressly stated but may be implied which may be gethered by examination of the relevant provisions of the two pieces of the legislation occupying the same field vi If one Act Provision Provisions in an Act makes lawful that which the other declares unlawful the two to that extent are inconsistent or repugnant The inconsistency must appear on the face of the impugned statutes provision provisions therein ix If both the pieces of provisions occupying the same field do not deal with the same matter but distinct though cognate or allied character there is no repeal by implica tion The <ORG> should endeavour to give effect to both the pieces of legislation as the <ORG> and the legislature of a State are empowered by the Constitution to make laws on any subject or subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List III of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The <ORG> examines the legislation as a whole and tries to find whether the impugned law is substantially within the competence of the <ORG> which enacted it even if it incidentally trespasses into the legislative field of anoth er <ORG> They are bound to overlap and where they do the question to be considered is what is the pith and substance of the impugned enactment and in what list is its true nature and character to be found If the Act when so viewed substantially falls within the powers expressly conferred upon the <ORG> which enacted it then it cannot be held to be invalid merely because it incidentally encroaches on matters which have been assigned to another <ORG> there was no question of any trespass upon the exclu sive jurisdiction vested in the <ORG> under Entry of List I the only question which survived being whether putting both the pieces of legislation enacted by the <ORG> and the State legislature together there was any repugnancy a contention which will be dealt with hereafter I have no hesitation to hold that the doctrine of pith and substance on the predoninant purpose or true nature and character of the law have no application when the matter in question is covered by an entry or entries in the Concurrent List and has occupied the same field both in the <ORG> and the State Law The <ORG> and Legislature of the State have exclusive power to legislate upon any subject or subjects in a Concurrent List Power to legislate whether derived from the con cerned Articles or legislative lists in Seventh Schedule With a non obstanti clause engrafted therein namely notwithstanding anything in Clause the <ORG> and subject to Clause the <ORG> of any State also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III Article of the Constitition removes the inconsistency between the law made by the <ORG> and by the <ORG>s of States Thus the power to legislate on the Concurrent List is derived by the <ORG> and the <ORG> of any State from Article read with Article only Similarly the <ORG> of a State derives its exclusive power from Article to make laws on any matters in List II at in considering the ques tion whether <ORG> power is not limited to cases specified in clauses a to of sub section of Section from Entry No of the List I of the Seventh Schedule it was held by Spens that it would not be right that the <ORG> would derive the power to legis late on this topic merely from the reference to it in the List because the purpose of the Lists was not to create or confer powers but only to distribute between the <ORG> and the Provincial <ORG>s the powers which had been conferred by Section and The power to legislate is given to the appro priate legislature by Article of the Constitution Thus I hold that the <ORG> and the legislature of a State derive their power to legislate on a subject subjects in Lists I and List II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution from Art The <ORG> and the legislature of a State have concurrent power to legis late upon any subject subjects in the Concurrent list III of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution give paramouncy to the law made by the <ORG> whether existing or made afresh or amended modified added or repealing the law subsequent in point of time to the state law made under Art The exercise of the power by a state legislature to make impugned law under one entry or other in the concurrent list is not decisive The concerned entry or entries is not the source of power to make impugned law Keeping the principles laid hereinbefore at the back of our mind let us consider the impugned provision It also confers the right on an applicant to apply for and authorises <ORG> to grant liberally contract carriage permit except in the area covered by and refusal appears to be an exception that too obviously for reasons to be recorded the Act and the relevant rules cover the entire field of making an applica tion in the prescribed manner and directs <ORG> to grant permit with condition attached thereto to run contract carriages vide ss and of the Act For the applicability of the principle that special law prevails over the general law the special law must be a valid law in operation In view of the finding that ss and are void the contention that the special law prevails over the general law is without sub stance Once <ORG> has made a law under that Article on a matter in <ORG> List the Legislatures of those <ORG>s on whose resolution the law was passed by <ORG> or which subsequently adopt it ceases to have a power to make a law relating to that matter and therefore there is no ques tion of retaining any legislative competence to make law on that matter and the loss of legislative power of the <ORG>s is complete and thereafter the <ORG>s can no longer make any law on a subject on which <ORG> has made a law and therefore their existing laws and any laws that they may venture to make in future will be null and void and for that matter Art is not exhausted and is still available to be invoked from time to time Though there is opposite school of juristic thought in my considered view the interpretation I have but up will sub serve the animation of the rounding fathers of the Constitu tion the Constitutional Scheme and purpose envisioned by Art But unless it again enacts law and reserves it for consideration and obtains the assent of the President afresh there is no prohibition for the petitioners to make applications for the grant of contract carriage permits under the Act and consideration and grant or refusal thereof according to law by the concerned <ORG> It is therefore made clear that this order does not preclude the Karnataka <ORG> Legislature to make afresh the law similar to ss and of the Acquisition Act with appropriate phraseology and to obtain the assent of the President
