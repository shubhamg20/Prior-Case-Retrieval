<ORG> is a company incorporated under the Companies Act and is a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORG> a <ORG> listed public company engaged in the business of developing BASE software for electronic payment solutions that enable card based payment transactions It is stated that the relationship between <ORG> and the banks which are using BASE software <ORG> Banks is governed by a license agreement that provides the right to <ORG> Banks to use and to customize the modules of the BASE software It has been submitted that a correct relevant market definition would have revealed that there is no issue of dominance in EFT Switch switch software market as defined by the <ORG> given the fact that there is ongoing entry by competitors and migration to substitutable switches by customers The switching of <ORG> customers to other switch software suppliers and new contract between some of the aforementioned switch software suppliers and different banks are but some of the developments that have and are continuing to take place in the market <ORG> has stated that there is no regulatory restriction on sale of EFT Switches in India hence there is no reason for ignoring buyers of EFT Switches while analysing the market power of EFT Switch suppliers in the relevant market It has been submitted that the DG has ignored the fact that <ORG> has not been able to operate independent of competitors or consumers and wrongly concluded that banks do not have countervailing buying power It is submitted that the <ORG> has erroneously accepted the allegation that <ORG> tried to foreclose the downstream market With respect to substitutability the <ORG> has relied upon the decision of <ORG> <ORG> in the case The end use of the product is the most important feature to determine the interchangeability and to examine whether they form a part of the same relevant market It has been stated by the Informant that the DG considered the prevalent industry practices on the basis of the submissions made by third parties including <ORG> competitor suppliers of EFT Switches and also the consumers of EFT Switches and thereby defined the relevant market accordingly In any event even if there is any fluctuation in the market share of <ORG> it is negligible and does not impact <ORG> position in the market The term relevant geographic market on the other hand has been defined in section of the Act to mean a market comprising the area in which the conditions of competition for supply or demand of goods or provision of services are distinctly homogenous and can be distinguished from the conditions prevailing in the neighboring areas <ORG> has given examples of its competitors <ORG> and <ORG> which though located outside India provide their software licenses to customers in India The <ORG> as such rejects ACI market definition i the market for electronic retail payment systems as electronic payment system is an umbrella term including different modes of payment which have different characteristics and different costs associated to the final consumers The <ORG> further observes that such transactions processed through mobile banking would form part of the relevant market As per the <ORG> since <ORG> was following a Transaction Based Pricing TBP for licensing of BASE software under which the license fee is linked to the number of transactions projected to be processed through the BASE software the volume of transactions that take place through each EFT Switch switch software would be the most appropriate indicator for calculating the respective market strength share of the supplier of BASE software in the relevant market Further it was submitted that <ORG> is not dominant in terms of estimated business share in IT and switch software It was also argued that <ORG> was not in a position to function independently of customers and competitors and that the DG has wrongly concluded that the banks do not have countervailing buying power and there are constraints for the banks to migrate to other EFT Switches <ORG> has claimed that there are numerous transactions on <ORG> which are routed through the <ORG> using <ORG> <ORG> switch As per the <ORG> the <ORG> has also taken into consideration other channels such as mobile phone transactions processed through the EFT Switch of the relevant bank hosted services that use an EFT Switch transactions processed by leading card issuers using the EFT Switch of the relevant bank such as <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> and internet payment gateway transactions Since the transaction itself passes through the EFT Switch of the relevant bank in any case there is no question of counting these switches again As mentioned above the <ORG> is of the view that although the <ORG> has delineated the relevant upstream market as the market for EFT Switch switch software in India it has failed to take into account the presence of other buyers of EFT Switch switch software in the relevant market for different transaction operations other than for core banking transaction requirements of the issuing bank while examining <ORG> dominance in the market Therefore the <ORG> concluded that the volume of transactions that take place through each switch software would be the most appropriate indicator of the respective market share Therefore the use of an EFT Switch in an ATM Network Interchange feature via the aforementioned inter bank ATM networks should also be taken into account while assessing the dominance of the Opposite Parties The <ORG> however observes that at the point of sale of EFT Switch switch software there are enough competitive options such as Electra Euronet or <ORG> available to the customers of EFT Switch switch software Accordingly no case of contravention of the provisions of section of the Act is made out against <ORG> in the present matter It is contended that the market definition of the <ORG> does not actually evaluate whether the services market is segmented according to the part of services supplied by vertically integrated suppliers and that by third parties The <ORG> has stated that it is only being able to provide services to <ORG> currently because of the interim order passed by the <ORG> which is preventing <ORG> from foreclosing the downstream market to <ORG> and other third parties Further the <ORG> has stated that there is no merit to <ORG> claim that customer banks did not feel any constraints upon the discontinuation of <ORG> services Having considered the opposing contentions of both the Parties to the matter as well as the findings of the DG the <ORG> observes that in order to determine whether the agreement as examined by the DG between <ORG> and its consumer banks would fall within the ambit of section of the Act it would first have to analyze whether the parties to the agreement are in a vertical relationship or not Accordingly the <ORG> concludes that no contravention of the provisions of section read with section and section of the Act has been established in the present case I have perused the final order passed by the majority of members of the <ORG> in this matter holding that <ORG> has not contravened any of the provisions of either section or section of the Act on the grounds detailed in the said order It has been vehemently argued by <ORG> and agreed to in the majority order of the <ORG> that Interchange Switch and EFT Switch are substitutable products and they form part of the same relevant market Keeping in mind the findings recorded by the DG and detailed submissions made by the parties in this regard I am of the opinion that because of the reasons recorded below Interchange Switch and EFT Switch constitute distinct product markets The relevant product market in the instant case as defined by the <ORG> is the market of EFT Switch switch software An Interchange Switch facilitates inter bank transaction by recognizing the issuing bank i the bank which has issued the card to a customer and routes the transactions accordingly to the issuing bank for authorization As regards the contention that since the same software is used in both EFT Switches and Interchange Switches they form part of the same market it is relevant to note that i Hence it performs the function of processing and authorizing transfer of funds as directed by the end customer through electronic means I have considered the rival submissions and the views expressed in the majority order on the issue of dominance of <ORG> in the relevant upstream market Based on the number of transactions that took place through the switch software it is reported by the DG that the annual market share of <ORG> in the relevant market during financial years was in the range of The <ORG> took into account all the transactions of users of EFT Switches Since such transactions pass through the EFT Switch of the relevant bank there is no point in counting these transactions twice and internet payment gateway transactions and mobile payment transactions are ultimately routed through and processed by concerned bank EFT Switch The relevant extracts of the responses of some of the banks before <ORG> may be note worthy i Yes there are challenges and risk in shifting from one payment platform which is already evolved over one decade Having determined that <ORG> is in a dominant position in the relevant upstream market of EFT Switch switch software in India I now proceed to examine the alleged abusive conduct of <ORG> in terms of the provisions of section of the Act Section states that no enterprise shall abuse its dominant position and section inter alia states that there shall be an abuse of dominant position under sub section if an enterprise a directly or indirectly imposes unfair or discriminatory i condition in purchase or sale of goods or service or ii price in purchase or sale including predatory price of goods or service or limits or restricts i production of goods or provision of services or market therefore or ii technical or scientific development relating to goods or services to the prejudice of consumers or indulges in practice or practices resulting in denial of market access in any manner or makes conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by other parties of supplementary obligations which by their nature or according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts or uses its dominant position in one relevant market to enter into or protect other relevant market The willingness to enter the downstream market by <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and others is based on an economic evaluation that there is the prospect of greater competition for third party professional services in the downstream market It was also urged by that the development of technology is accelerated rather than impeded and there is a greater scope for innovation as more and more enterprises gain expertise in this domain Also it is observed that <ORG> sought to enter into the downstream market by using the provision in the license agreement which requires the banks to seek its consent and to exclude any third party service provider including the <ORG> from the market This is nothing but making the conclusion of contracts of <ORG> subject to acceptance by banks of a supplementary obligation which has no connection with the subject of the contract
