An order was subsequently passed in these terms His Majesty having taken the said report into consideration was pleased by and with the advice of His Privy Council to approve thereof and to order as it is hereby ordered that the said appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed for non prosecution whereof the Judges of <ORG> at Allahabad fur the time being and all other persons whom it may concern are to take notice and govern themselves accordingly An objection was taken to this application by the judgment debtor on the ground that it was barred by limitation and on the further ground that the procedure enjoined by Section of the Code of Civil Procedure of had not been followed The decree holder then on the th of June applied to this Court under Section and an order was passed to this effect Let the order be sent down to the Court below for necessary execution according to law The decree holder then applied for a decree absolute under Order XXXIV Rule of Act of This application was met by the objection on behalf of the judgment debtor that the application was barred by limitation that the only decree which was capable of execution was the decree of <ORG> passed on the th of April that the order of their Lordships of <ORG> did not affirm that decree but merely dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution and that there was no order or decree of <ORG> which was capable of execution If on the other hand the order of <ORG> is an order which can be executed the application of the decree holder is governed by Article of Act XV of corresponding to Article of Act IX of If the order of His Majesty of the th of May is treated as an affirmance of the decree of this Court it seems to me that it is the decree or order of the final <ORG> and is an order which can be executed and as years have not elapsed since the date of that order the application of the creditor is not barred by limitation In <NAME> <NAME> A it was held by their Lordships of <ORG> that when a decision of the judicial <ORG> has been reported and sanctioned and embodied in an order of <ORG> it becomes the decree or order of the final <ORG> and it is the duty of every subordinate tribunal to whom the order is addressed to carry it into execution that although an order of Her late Majesty in Council only confirms a decree of the <ORG> below that order is the paramount decision in the suit and any application to enforce it is in point of law an application to execute the order and not the decree which it confirmed <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> observed Although an order of Her Majesty in Council may confirm the decree of the <ORG> below that order is undoubtedly the paramount decision in the suit and any application to enforce it is in point of law an application to execute the order and not the decree which it confirmed Then he observes that before the decree holder can obtain execution he must apply to the High <ORG> under Section of the Code to transmit the order of Her Majesty to the <ORG> whose duty it is to issue execution and it is clear from the language of that section that the <ORG> to which the order is transmitted has to execute not its own decree but the order itself if this were not so there would seem no necessity for applying to the High <ORG> at all In that case it will be observed the order of <ORG> affirmed the decree of <ORG> and it may be said that there was no such affirmance of the decree of <ORG> in the present case That section falls within Chapter XLV which treats of appeals to His Majesty in Council and it prescribes the requirements for such an appeal and amongst others enjoins that where the decree appealed from affirms the decision of the <ORG> immediately below the <ORG> passing such decree the appeal must involve some substantial question of law I A lends support to the view taken in the last mentioned case In that case a preliminary objection was taken on behalf of the respondents to the hearing of an appeal before their lordships on the ground that the order giving leave to appeal was not in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure It need not also affirm the grounds of fact on which the judgment was passed and that where the decree of the appellate <ORG> was that the appeal be dismissed but the reasons given were not the same as those of the lower <ORG> in respect of some matters of fact the appellate <ORG> by the dismissal affirmed the decision of the lower <ORG> within the meaning of the section This decision appears to me to lend strong support to the argument addressed to us on behalf of the respondent that the dismissal of an appeal operates as an affirmance of the decree of the <ORG> from which the appeal is preferred and it is immaterial on what grounds it is dismissed It seems to me therefore that we ought to treat the order of His Majesty in Council as the final order in the litigation and the order which alone in capable of enforcement I would therefore dismiss the appeal The question to be determined in this appeal is whether the application of the respondent for an order absolute for sale under Section of the Transfer of Property Act is barred by limitation as contended by the appellant The appellant preferred an appeal to His Majesty in Council allowed it to remain pending till the th of May when it was dismissed for non prosecution no effectual steps having been taken by the appellant for its hearing On the th of June the application which has given rise to this appeal was presented However as Order XXXIV does not apply to this case we must in accordance with the ruling of <ORG> hold the present application to be an application in execution and we must consider what article of Schedule II of the Limitation Act applies to it Article applies if there is no other article in the schedule which governs the application It is urged on behalf of the respondent that Article of Schedule II to Act XV of to which Article Schedule I to Act IX of corresponds is applicable We have to determine whether the order which the respondent seeks to enforce is an order of His Majesty in Council within the meaning and intention of the article When a decision of their Lordships of <ORG> has been reported to His Majesty and has been sanctioned and embodied in an order of His Majesty in Council it becomes the order of His Majesty and the final order in the case which a <ORG> is to carry into effect This report was taken into consideration by His Majesty and was approved of and it was ordered that the appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed for non prosecution The necessary effect of an order dismissing an appeal from the decree of a subordinate <ORG> is an affirmance of that decree I was a party to this ruling and I see no reason to alter the opinion therein expressed In that case the decree of the appellate <ORG> was as the report of the case shows that the appeal should be dismissed with costs The principle of these cases applies to the present case and applying that principle it cannot but be held that the order of His Majesty dismissing the appellant appeal affirmed the decree of this <ORG> I also would dismiss the appeal The order of the <ORG> is that the appeal be dismissed with costs
