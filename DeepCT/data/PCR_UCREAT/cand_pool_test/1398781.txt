After the Governor issued necessary sanction the appellant filed a fresh complaint in <ORG> against the respondent on the same grounds The respondent contended that the Special Judge had no jurisdiction to try him under of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and that no cognizance could be taken on private complaint In the meantime the State <ORG> issued a notification under of the Criminal Law Amendment Act under which the case was transferred to another Special Judge When the latter Special Judge proceeded with the case the respondent filed an application for his discharge on the grounds that the charge against him was baseless and that he being a Member of legislative Assembly A requisite sanction under of the Act was necessary and hl the absence of the sanction of <ORG> he could not take cognizance of offence The appellant challenged the order of the Special Judge in this Appeal The questions which arose for consideration were a That is the relevant date with reference to which a valid sanction is a pre requisite for the prosecution of a public servant for offences enumerated in of the Act If the accuse holds several offices occupying each of which makes him a public servant is sanction of each one of the competent authorities entitled to remove him from each one of the offices held by him necessary and if anyone of the competent authorities fails or declines to grant sanction is the Court precluded or prohibited from taking cognizance of the offence with which the public servant is charged or is it implicit in of the Act that sanction of that competent authority alone is necessary which is entitled to remove the public servant from the office which is alleged to have been abused or misused for corrupt motives Is <ORG> a public HELD The provisions of the Act must receive such construction at the hands of the court as would advance the object and purpose underlying the Act and at any rate not defeat it In the event of an ambiguity of the plain meaning of the words used in the statute being self defeating the court is entitled to ascertain the intention of the legislature to remove the ambiguity by construing the provision of the statute as a whole keeping in view what was the mischief when the statute was enacted and to remove which the legislature enacted the statute Whenever a question of construction arises upon ambiguity or where two views are possible of a Provision it would be the duty of the court to adopt that construction which would advance the object underlying the Act A For this purpose why should the aids which <ORG> availed of such as report of a special committee preceding the enactment existing state of law the environment necessitating enactment of legislation and the object sought to be achieved be denied to court whose function is primarily to give effect to the real intention of the <ORG> in enacting the legislation While it may be permissible to refer to dictionaries to find out the meaning in which a word is capable of being used or understood in common parlance the well known cannon of construction should not even for a minute be overlooked that the meaning to the words and expressions used in a statute ordinarily take their colour from the context in which they appear Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act bars the courts from taking cognizance of the offences therein enumerated alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the competent authority empowered to grant the requisite sanction Therefore when the court is called upon to take cognizance of such offences it must enquire whether there is a valid sanction to prosecute the public servant for the offence alleged to have been committed by him as public servant the Act clearly spell out that the offences there in defined can be committed by a public servant It is well settled that the relevant date with reference to valid which a valid sanction is sine qua non for taking cognizance of an offence committed by a public servant as required by is the date when the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence of which he is accused If therefore when the offence is alleged to have been committed the accused was a public servant but by the time the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence committed by him as public servant he has cased to be a public servant will not be attracted and no sanction would be necessary for taking cognizance of the offence against him A fortiori no sanction as contemplated by was necessary before cognizance of the offence could be taken against the accused for offences alleged to have been committed in his former capacity as public servant The authority entitled to grant sanction must apply its mind to the facts of the case evidence collected and other incidental facts before according sanction <ORG> appears to comprehend situations where as preliminary to or an end product of an adjudicatory function in a criminal case which may lead to imposition of a prison sentence and a Person in exercise of the duty to be discharged by him by virtue of his office places or keeps any person in confinement As the contentions canvassed before this Court are mainly questions of law facts at this stage having a peripheral relevance in the course of discussion it is unnecessary to set out the prosecution case as disclosed in the complaint filed by complainant <NAME> complainant for short in detail save and except few a pertinent and relevant allegations The complainant moved the Governor cf Maharashtra by his application dated September requesting him to grant sanction to prosecute the accused as required by Sec of Act and ultimately held that in the absence of a valid sanction from the Governor of Maharashtra the complaint filed by the complainant for the aforementioned three offences was not maintainable In the meantime another development had taken place which may be briefly noticed The writ petition came up for hearing before another learned Single Judge who by his judgment dated January made the rule absolute The complaint proceeded to refer to the setting up of various trusts and alleged that the corner stone of the scheme involved receipt by the accused of illegal gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official functions favour or disfavor to persons or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to such persons who dealt with the State Government in general and with public servants who formed part of the Government It was specifically alleged that the scheme devised by the accused was a flagrant abuse of his official position as Chief Minister for obtaining control over funds which would be used for purposes conducive to the interest of the accused himself To this complaint the order granting sanction to prosecute the accused made by the Governor of Maharashtra was annexed and produced After recording the verification of the complaint the learned Special Judge took cognizance of the offences and issued process by directing a bailable warrant to be issued in the sum of Rs On the process being served the accused appeared and sought exemption from personal appearance which was granted for a day and the case was adjourned to October for recording the evidence of the complainant and his witnesses for the prosecution When the case was called out on October an application was moved on behalf of the accused inter alia contending that <ORG> learned special Judge had no jurisdiction in view of the provision contained in Sec The learned special Judge by his order dated October rejected both the contentions and set down the case for November for recording evidence of the prosecution The second petition requested the learned Judge to postponed the case till the petition for special leave field by the accused against the decision of <ORG> cf <ORG> holding that the private complaint was maintainable is disposed of Both these applications came up for hearing before <NAME> who by his order dated July upheld the contention of the accused that <NAME> was a public servant within the meaning of the expression in Sec This <ORG> u<NAME>imately granted special leave to appeal as also rule nisi in the writ petition The learned Judge further held that the A holds an office and he can be removed from that office by <ORG> because the latter has the power to expel a member which would amount to removal from office The learned Judge further held that as there was no sanction by <ORG> to prosecute the accused and as the Governor had no power to sanction prosecution of the accused in his capacity as A the accused is entitled to be discharged for the of offences under Secs of the Act for want of a valid sanction for prosecution and in respect of the other offences the accused is entitled to be discharged on the ground that the court of the special Judge had no jurisdiction to try the accused for those offences of the Act defines the offence of criminal misconduct and a public servant who commits an offence of criminal misconduct is liable to be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine It reads as under No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section or Section of the Indian Penal Code or under sub section of Section of this Act alleged to have been committee by a public servant except with the previous sanction a in the case of a person who is employed in connection with affairs of the Union and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Central Government in the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of a <ORG> and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the <ORG> Government in the case of ally other person of the authority competent to remove him from his office With a view to eradicating the evil of bribery and corruption <ORG> set up a Committee to make recommendations for the improvement of the laws relating to bribery and corruption under the Chairmanship of Dr <NAME> The recommendations of the Committee led to the enactment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act By the Act power was conferred on the State Government to appoint special offences as may be necessary for such area or areas as may be specified in the notification to try the following offences namely offences punishable under Sections and A and Sec with which the accused may under the Code of Criminal Procedure be charged at the same trial <ORG> was deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury within the local limits of the jurisdiction of <ORG> for the purposes of Chapter XXXI and XXXII of the Code of Criminal Procedure as provided by Sec The second submission was that if the first question is answered in the affirmative it would be necessary to examine whether a sanction as contemplated by Sec On these rival contentions some vitat and some not so vital points arise for consideration some easy of answer and some none tooeasy Indisputably therefore the provisions of the Act must receive such construction at the hands of the court as would advancehte object and purpose underlying the Act and at any rate not defeat it The question of construction arises only in the event of an ambiguity or the plain meaning of the words used in the statute would be self defeating The court is entitled to ascertain the intention of the legislature to remove the ambiguity or the plain meaning of the words used in the statute would be self defeating The court is entitled to ascertain the intention of the legislature to remove the ambiguity by construing the provision of the statute as a whole keeping in view what was the mischief when the statute was enacted and to remove which the legislature enacted the statute Adopting this rule of construction whenever a question of construction arises upon ambiguity or where two views are possible of a provision it would be the duty of the court to adopt that construction which would advance the object underlying the Act namely to make effective provision for the prevention of bribery and corruption and at any rate not defeat it of Act prescribes procedure and powers of special Judge empowered to try offences set out in Sec In this appeal we will proceed on the assumption that a special Judge can take cognizance of offences he is competent to try on a private complaint The object underlying such provision was to save the public servant from the harassment of frivolous or unsubstantiated allegations Existence thus of a valid sanction is a pre requisite to the taking of cognizance of the enumerated offences alleged to have been committed by a public servant Therefore when the court is called upon to take cognizances of such offences it must enquire whether there is a valid sanction to prosecute the public servant for the offence alleged to have been committed by him as public servant of the Act clearly spell out that the offences therein defined can be committed by a public servant If it is contemplated to prosecute public servant who has committed such offences when the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence a sanction ought to be available otherwise the court would have no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence But the terminus a quo for a valid sanction is the time when the court is called upon to the cognizance of the offence If therefore when the offence is alleged to have been committed the accused was a public servant but by the time the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence committed by him as public servant he has ceased to be public servant no sanction would be necessary for taking cognizance of the offence against him As a necessary corollary if the accused has ceased to be a public servant at the time when the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence alleged to have been committed by him as public servant Sec It therefore appears well settled that the relevant date with reference to which a valid sanction is sine qua non for taking cognizance of an offence committed by a public servant required by Sec In other words he was not public servant in his capacity as Chief Minister on August when the court took cognizance of the offence against him was necessary before cognizance of the offence could be taken against the accused for offences alleged to have been committed in his former capacity as public servant Re and It was strenuously contended that if the accused has held or holds a plurality of offices occupying each one of which makes him a public servant sanction of each one of the competent authorities entitled to remove him from each one of the offices held by him would be necessary and if anyone of the competent authorities fails or declines to grant sanction the court is precluded or prohibited fome taking cognizance of the offence with the public servant is charged bars taking cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by public servant except with the previous snaction of the authority competent to remove him from his office In order to appreciate the rival contentions the fact situation relevant to the topic under discussion may be noticed He was appointed as Chief Minister of Maharashtra State and he was holding that office at the time he is alleged to have committed the offences set out in the complaint filed against him However he continued to retain his seat as A The contention is that as A he was a public servant a submission seriously controverted which we would presently examine and that he was such public servant even on the date on which the court took cognizance of the offences set out in the complaint without a valid sanction and therefore the court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences the court must hold that if the public servant who is being prosecuted holds more than one public office occupying each one of which makes him public servants a sanction to prosecute of each competent authority entitled to remove him from each office is necessitous before taking cognizance of offences against him In a society governed by rule of law power is conferred on office or acquired by statutory status and the individual occupying the office or on whom status is conferred enjoys the power of office or power flowing from the status uses the expression office and the power to grant sanction is conferred on the authority competent to remove the public servant from his office and Sec requires a sanction before taking cognizance of offences committed by public servant The offence could be committed by the public servant by misusing or abusing the power of office and it is from that office the authority must be competent to remove him so as to be entitled to grant sanction By a catena of decisions it has been held that the authority entitled to grant sanction must apply its mind to the facts of the case evidence collected and other incidental facts before according sanction That competent authority alone would know the nature and functions discharged by the public servant holding the office and whether the same has been abused or misused Now if the public servant holds two offices and he is accused of having abused one and from which he is removed but continues to hold the other which is neither alleged to have been used nor abused is a sanction of the authority competent to remove him from the office which is neither alleged or shown to have been abused or misused necessary The submission is that if the harassment of the public servant by a frivolous prosecution and criminal waste of his time in law courts keeping him away from discharging public duty are the objects underlying Sec An illustration was posed to the learned counsel that a Minister who is indisputably a public servant greased his palms by abusing his office as Minister and then ceased to hold the office before the court was called upon to take cognizance of the offence against him and therefore sanction as contemplated by Sec One can legitimately envisage a situation wherein a person may hold a dozen different offices each one clothing him with the status of a public servant under Sec IPC and even if he has abused only one office for which either there is a valid sanction to prosecute him or he has ceased to hold that office by the time court was called upon to take cognizance yet on this assumption sanction of different competent authorities each of which was entitled to remove him from different public offices would be necessary before the court can take cognizance of the offence committed by such public servant while abusing one office which he may have ceased to hold He retired from the service on th June but was re employed for a period of years with effect from th June A contention was raised on behalf of the accused that the court could not take cognizance of the offence in the absence of a valid sanction of the authority competent to remove him from the office held by him as a public servant Accordingly it was held that a sanction to prosecute him was necessary and in the absence of which the court could not that cognizance of the offences and the prosecution was quashed Thereafter the court proceeded to examine whether the accused was a public servant on the date when the court took cognizance of the offence and concluded that once the accused was transferred to <ORG> he retained his character as a public servant because he was required to undergo training and to be called up for service as and when required This decision is of no assistance for the obvious reason that nowhere it was contended before the court which office was alleged to have been abused by the accused and whether the two offices were separate and distinct We would however like to make it abundantly clear that if the two decisions purport to lay down that even if a public servant has ceased to hold that office as public servant which he is alleged to have abused or misused for corrupt motives but on the date of taking cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by him as a public servant which he ceased to be and holds an entirely different public office which he is neither alleged to have misused or abused for corrupt motives yet the sanction of authority competent to remove him from such latter office would be necessary before taking cognizance of the offence alleged to have been committed by the public servant while holding an office which he is alleged to have abused or misused and which he has ceased to hold the decisions in our opinion do not lay down the correct law and cannot be accepted as making a correct interpretation of Sec The appeal can succeed on this short ground The learned special Judge held that the accused as A is a public servant because he is in the pay of the <ORG> or he is remunerated by feces for the performance of public duty by the <ORG> The learned special Judge simultaneously rejected the contention canvassed on behalf of the accused that the accused is a public servant because he is a person empowered by law to discharge as a member of a body of persons adjudicatory functions as contemplated by the Third clause of Sec It was contended on behalf of the complainant that the expression in the pay of the <ORG> would in the context in which the expression is used in Sec a mean only one thing that the payment must be by a master to a servant and unless there is relationship of master and servant or relationship of command and obedience between the payer and the payee mere payment even if styled as pay would not mean that the payee is in the pay of the payer Proceeding along it was submitted that A could not be said to be subject to obedience of any command by the <ORG> and therefore the accused as A could not be said to be in the pay of the <ORG> It was urged that in that sense the expression <ORG> in cl a would mean Executive <ORG> and it would be adding insult to injury if it can ever be said that A is in the pay of the Executive <ORG> or State <ORG> It was also submitted on behalf of the accused that it would be constitutional impertinence to say that A does not perform any public duty In support of the submission reliance was placed upon <ORG> Inland Revenue <ORG>ers in which <ORG> declined to look into the Report of the Royal <ORG> on Income tax in order to ascertain the meaning of certain words in the Income Tax Act on the ground that no such evidence for the purpose of showing the intention that is the purpose or object of an Act is admissible There is a strong case for whittling A was added to the Income tax Act can be taken into consideration for the purpose of interpreting relevant provisions of the Partnership Act Act and that statement cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of interpreting the relevant provisions of the Partnership Act In these days when the long title can be amended in both Houses I can see no reason for having recourse to it only in case of an ambiguity it is the plainest of all the guides to the general objectives of a statute It may also be mentioned that Per Curiam it was held that where there is an ambiguity in a statute the court may have regard to the Report of a Committee presented to <ORG> containing proposals for legislation which resulted in the enactment of the statute in order to determine the mischief which the statute was intended to remedy If the basic purpose underlying construction of a legislation is to ascertain the real intention of the <ORG> why should the aids which <ORG> availed of such as report of a special committee preceding the enactment existing state of law the environment necessitating enactment of legislation and the object sought to be achieved be denied to court whose function is primarily to give effect to the real intention of the <ORG> in enacting the legislation It reads as under The judicial opinion on this point is certainly not quite uniform and there are American decisions to the effect that the general history of a statute and the various steps leading upto an enactment including amendments or modifications of the original bill and reports of <ORG> can be looked at for ascertaining the intention of the legislature where it is in doubt but they hold definitely that the legislative history is inadmissible when there is no obscurity in the meaning of the statute In the book Evolution of Parliamentary Privileges by <NAME> the author traced the steps which led to the introduction of the Bill In the statement of objects and reasons accompanying the Bill it was stated that the corrupt influencing of votes of members of the legislature by bribery intimidation and like should be made penal offences under the ordinary criminal law and para indicates that this recommendation was a unanimous recommendation of the <ORG> as a whole Then comes the more important statement which may be extracted The tender of a bribe to or the receiving of a bribe by a member of a legislature in India as an inducement for him to act in a particular manner as a member of the legislature is not at present an offence It thus follows that till it was clearly understood that the A as the holder of that office which must have come into existence by the time under the Government of India Act was not a public servant falling in any of the clauses of Sec and this lacuna was sought to be remedied by introducing Chapter bearing the heading of offences by or relating to members of Legislature Bodies It should also be made clear that all Ministers Ministers of <ORG> Deputy Ministers Parliamentary Secretaries and members of local authorities come under the definition of public servant A further category should be added to included all persons discharging adjudicatory functions under any <ORG> or <ORG> Law for the time being in force We also consider it necessary to include the following categories within the definition of the term public servant President Secretary and all members of <ORG> of a registered <ORG> Office bearers and employees of educational social religious and other institutions in whatever manner established which receive aid in any form from the Central or State Government Third Every Judge in including any person empo wered by law to discharge whether by himself or as a member of any body of per sons any adjudicatory functions Ninth Every officer whose duty Ninth Every officer it is as such officer to take whose duty it is as such receive keep or expend any officer to take receive property of the <ORG> keep or expend any property or to make any survey on behalf of the <ORG> assessment or contract on or to make any survey as behalf of the <ORG> or to sessment or contract on be execute any revenue process half of the <ORG> or to or to report on any matter affec ting the pecuniary interest of execute any revenue process the Government or to make or to investigate or to authenticate or keep any docu report on any matter affec ment relating to the pecuniary ting the pecuniary interest interest of the Government of the Government or make or to prevent he infraction of authenticate or keep any any law for the protection of document relating to the of the pecuniary interests of pecuniary interests of the the Government and every Government or to prevent officer in the service or pay the infraction of any law of the Government or remunerat for the protection of the ed by fees or commission for pecuniary interest of the performance of any public Government Mr <NAME> while piloting the Bill on November amongst others stated that the will not deal with those recommendations which had not been accepted by the <ORG> but would explain them later if any point is raised in that behalf See Lok Sabha Debates Third that he will not deal with those recommendations which had not been accepted by the <ORG> but would explain them later if any point is raised in that behalf But there is an interesting caveat to this statement to which we would presently revert He further stated that the specific recommendations about the definition public servant to include Ministers has not been accepted and included in the Bill because Ministers are not merely public servants but they have a greater moral and social responsibility towards the people If A was not comprehended in clause before its amendment and dissection it would make no difference in the meaning of law if a portion of cl is re enacted as cl a It must follow as a necessary corollary that the amendment of Cls In the appeal by the <ORG> this Court held that the case of the accused would be covered by the last part of cl because the accused fulfilled the twin conditions of either being in the service or pay of the <ORG> and was entrusted with the performance of a public duty It was further held that the context of the whole of the Ninth Clause as remuneration or in respect of the performance of public duty a of clause Twelfth showed the legislative interpretation of the material portion of clause Ninth as it stood before the amendment under consideration After extraction these reasons which appealed to <ORG> this Court observed than the reasoning of <ORG> does not suffer fro many infirmity This apparently does not make any difference It would therefore necessarily follow that the amendment of cls and did not bring about any change in the coverage and construction of the two clauses prior to and since their amendment If that be so it would follow as necessary corollary that if A was not a public servant with in the meaning of the expression prior to Act of since the Act the law legal effect and on average of expression public servant remains unaltered and hence A is not a public servant comprehended in cl a IPC and the amendment by Amending Act of did not bring about the slightest change in this behalf concerning the position of A Therefor apart from anything else on historical evolution of Sec On behalf of the complainant appellant it was contended that in order to make a person a public servant on the ground that he is in the pay of the <ORG> there must exist a master servant relationship or a command obedience relationship and if these elements are absent even if a person is in the pay of the <ORG> he would not be a public servant Read in this manner there are three independent categories comprehended in cl a and if a person falls in any one of them he would be a public servant We therefore consider it unnecessary to refer to those decisions which were cited on behalf of the respondent that the correct canon of construction to be adopted in such a situation is that effect must be given if possible to the words used in the statute for the <ORG> is deemed not to waste its words or to say anything in vain Armed with this power <ORG> has enacted The Maharashtra <ORG> Members Salaries and Allowances Act Bombay Act XLIX of provides that there shall be paid to each member during the whole of his term of office a salary at the rate of Rs provides that there shall be paid to each Member during the whole of his term of office per month a sum of Rs per month to every person who has served as a Member of the State <ORG> for a term of years subject to other conditions prescribed in the section There is a similar Act which makes provisions for salaries and allowances of the Ministers of Maharashtra State While it may be permissible to refer to dictionaries to find out the meaning in which a word is capable of being used or understood in common parlance the well known canon of construction should not even for a minute be overlooked that the meaning of the words and expressions used in a statute ordinarily take their colour from the context in which they appear What particular meaning should be attached to words and phrases in a given instrument is usually to be gathered from the context the nature of the subject matter the purpose of the intention of the author and the effect of giving to them one or the other permissible me aning on the object to be achieved With this caution we may briefly refer to the meaning of the expression pay and in the pay of given by different dictionaries As far as the expression pay is concerned a Constitution Bench of this Court in <NAME> case referred to various dictionaries and concluded that the word ordinarily means salary compensation wages or any amount of money paid to the person who is described as in the pay of the payer On the other hand it was asserted that the point is concluded by the observation of <ORG> that so far as the second limb of the clause in the pay of the <ORG> is concerned that appears to be of a much wider amplitude so as to include within its ambit even a public servant who pay of the other person and yet there may not be a master servant relationship between them In Concise Oxford Dictionary th edition at page the meaning assigned to the expression in the pay of is in the employment of In <ORG> New World Dictionary the phrase in the pay of carries the meaning employed and paid by It was submitted even if A is paid by a sum styled as pay unless is servant of A it cannot be said that is in the pay of A We see force in this submission In respect of the extracted observation of <ORG> there is no attempt to distinguish the decision in <NAME> case and therefore it is not necessity to consider the decisions cited in support of the submission that a judgment of <ORG> especially of <ORG> cannot be distinguished lightly and is binding on us and unless questions of fundamental importance to national life are involved need not be by us That the said salary is paid to the Chief Minister or the Minister from the Government funds It was assumed that salary and allowances paid to the Chief Minister are by <ORG> The question may be posed thus Even if A receives salary and allowances under the relevant statute is he in the pay of the <ORG> In other words what does the expression <ORG> connote There is a short and a long answer to the problem Therefore the question boils down to this whether A is in the pay of <ORG> or is remunerated by fees for the performance of any public duty by <ORG> In the debate between the Presidential form and Parliamentary form of democracy during the early days of <ORG> the balance tilted in favour of Parliamentary form of Government This <ORG> is also responsible for laying before the <ORG> an estimate of the expenses of the <ORG> departments and of any other expenses incurred for the service of <ORG> Let us turn to relevant provisions of the Constitution estimates as relate to other expenditure shall be submitted in the form of demands for grants to the <ORG> and the <ORG> shall have power to assent or to refuse to assent to any demand or to assent to any demand subject to a reduction of the amount specified therein In this background even if there is an officer to disburse this payment or that a pay bill has to be drawn up are not such factors being decisive of the matter This becomes further clear from the provision contained in Art The expression <ORG> and <ORG> two separate entities are sought to be included in the expression State which would mean that otherwise they are distinct and separate entities It was also contended that <ORG> is not performing any public duty He no doubt performs public duties cast on him by the Constitutional and his electorate He thus discharges constitutional functions for which he is remunerated by fees under the Constitution and not by the <ORG> It was further held by the majority that the payment of money to and the receipt of money by a member of <ORG> to induce him to use his official position whether inside or outside <ORG> for the purpose of influencing or putting pressure on a Minister or other officer of the <ORG> to enter into or carry out a transaction involving payment of money out of the public funds are acts tending to the public mischief and an agreement or combination to do such acts amounts to a criminal offence It was also held that he holds an office Even such modicum of decency in public life as disclosing relevant pecuniary interest or benefit of whatever nature whether direct or indirect that he may have had or may be expecting to have while participating in a debate or proceeding in <ORG> by in was stoutly resisted in Accepting the position that inclusive definition extends the specific meaning of the expression which it would not otherwise bear it is necessary to determine whether this extension of the expression Judge is so wide as to cover within its umbrella A on the ground that while voting upon a motion for breach of privilege or for contempt of the <ORG> he is discharging adjudicatory functions and that he is so empowered by law to do so When with the permission of the Speaker a motion for breach of privilege is moved in <ORG> or a motion for taking action for contempt of the <ORG> is moved undoubtedly every member of the <ORG> has a right to participate and after the motion is debated upon the majority vote is recorded as a decision of the <ORG> Does that make A a person as a member of a body persons who discharges adjudicatory functions The definition of expression Judge comprehends adjudication in any legal proceeding civil or criminal and in which the person as a Judge is empowered to give a definitive judgment The <ORG> has the power to punish for contempt and the penal jurisdiction of the <ORG> is not confined to their own Members nor to offences committed in their presence but extends to all contempts of the <ORG>s whether committed by Members or by persons who are not Members irrespective of whether the offence is committed within the <ORG> or beyond its walls No of it was clearly stated that the result of the provision contained in the latter part of Art It was further observed that the <ORG> and indeed all Legislative Assemblies in India never discharged any judicial functions and their historical and constitutional back ground does not support the claim that they can be regarded as <ORG> in any sense Undoubtedly <ORG> in view of the provisions contained in Art imposes a restriction on the legislative power of the <ORG> to make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III and any law made in contravention of sub Art shall to the extents of the contravention be void Expression law as used here would be law other than Constitution After so saying the trend of discussion in various judgments in <NAME> <ORG> of Kerala and another shows that when the power amend the Constitution is exercise by <ORG> it exercises Constituent power and this is independent of the ordinary legislative process A passing reference may also be made to the form of oath prescribed for a Judge of <ORG> and the Judge of <ORG> in the Third Schedule which separately refer to the Constitution and the laws but second is the power flowing from the execution of the sentence to place or keep any person in confinement meaning thereby there is an execution of warrant Persons whose duty it is to deprive a person directed to be imprisoned to deprive him of his liberty to remain free and to keep or place him in confinement in due execution of the warrant would be comprehended in cl The authors observed at page that each <ORG> of <ORG> has the power to secure the attendance of persons on matters of privilege and to punish for break of privilege or contempt of the <ORG> and commit the offender to custody or prison It appears to comprehend situations where as preliminary to or an end product of an adjudicatory function in a criminal case which may lead to imposition of a prison sentence and a person in exercise of the duty to be discharged by him by virtue of his office places or keeps any person in confinement He reached the conclusion that a sanction is necessary before cognizance can be taken If the accused has ceased to hold that office by the date the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offences alleged to have been committed by such public servant no sanction under Sec would be necessary despite the fact that he may be holding any other office on the relevant date which may make him a public servant as understood in Sec if there is no allegation that office has been abused or misused for corrupt motives on the date on which the court took cognizance of the offences alleged to have been committed by the accused The vital question has become one of academic interest The question is left open Before we conclude let it be clarified that more often in the course of this judgment we have used the words office of <ORG> It was debated whether the <ORG> holds seat or office Our use of the expression office should not be construed to mean that we have accepted that the position of <ORG> can be aptly described a and further erred in holding that a sanction of <ORG> or majority of the members was a condition precedent to taking cognizance of offences committed by the accused
