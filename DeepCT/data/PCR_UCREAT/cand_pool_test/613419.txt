It is sufficient to say that when leave to appeal was granted by the order of <ORG> of April it was on the specific ground that it raised the substantial question of law namely whether an adoption of a son by a Hindu made after the execution and delivery of a deed of gift but before registration thereof renders a deed void as against the adopted son This is the only ground of appeal which is set forth in the appellant case and respondents in their case paragraph take up the same position The relevant facts which are no longer disputed lie within short compass On September a certain <NAME> executed a trust deed by which he appointed trustees to administer a trust for charity in the wide sense including the maintenance of religious services at certain temples There is no question now that this constituted a gift of immovable property within the meaning of Section of the Transfer of Property Act nor is there any question that the trust deed on the day of its execution was duly delivered to the trustees named therein On September he executed a deed of guardianship to the newly adopted son and on the th a partition deed between himself and the guardian of that son the effect of which need not for the purpose of this judgment be further referred to On this it was contended for the appellant that the deed of gift was not complete until registration and that as the grantor had before registration adopted the appellant as his son the latter rights in the family property had intervened so as to revoke or invalidate the gift Section is in these terms For the purpose of making a gift of immovable property the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses The controversy in the numerous cases in the Courts of India which have dealt with this point has always centred round the words in this section The transfer must be effected by a registered instrument and it has been forcibly argued that until registration there is no complete gift and that if the donor dies or revokes or becomes incapable of making the gift before registration it cannot take effect In that case the donor died on the day following the execution of the deed of gift and the deed was not presented for registration until a period of six months had elapsed from the date of his death facts which as it appears to their Lordships were cartainly not less cogent in favour of imcompleteness than are those in the present case and there the District Judge held that the gift deed not having been registered by the donor during her lifetime was void and that the post mortem registration was of no effect There was no express finding of fact so far as appears from the report that the deed of gift had been delivered to and accepted by the donee prior to the death of the donor although perhaps this may be implied from the circumstances In the present case fortunately there is no room for doubt on this point because the learned Judges of <ORG> remitted this question of fact to the Subordinate Judge and he reported that the deed had been delivered over on the day of its execution to one of the trustees appointed under it on behalf of himself and the other trustee The decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case is thus summarized in the head note There is nothing in Section of the Transfer of Property Act which requires the donor to have the deed registered all that is required is that he should have executed the deed Registration does not depend upon his consent but is the act of an officer appointed by law for the purpose who if the deed is executed by or on behalf of the donor and is attested by at least two witnesses must register it if it is presented by a person having the necessary interest within the prescribed period Their Lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty that the judgment and decrees of <ORG> should be affirmed and that this appeal should be dismissed
