HEADNOTE The expenditure incurred by a company carrying on the manufacture and sale of textile goods in registering for the first time its trade marks which were not in use prior to the th January is revenue expenditure and an allowable deduction under Sec It is only an additional and incidental facility given to the owner of the trade mark it adds nothing to the trade mark itself The respondent is a textile mills company carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling textile goods At the desire of the appellant the <ORG> submitted the following question for the opinion of <ORG> Whether on the facts of the case the expenditure incurred by the assessee company in registering for the first time its trade marks which were not in use prior to the th February is revenue expenditure and an allowable deduction under section xv of the Indian Income tax Act <ORG> following its previous decision and finding that the fact of the trade marks having come into use after the th of February made no difference in the result answered the question in the affirmative It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the ques tion whether a certain disbursement was of a capital or revenue nature has to be decided according to the principle laid down in <ORG> Atherton The test that capital expenditure is a thing that is going to be spent once and for all and income expenditure is a thing that is going to recur every year was considered an useful element in arriving at the decision but was not certainly the deci sive fact The Lord Chancellor observed as follows But when an expenditure is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advan tage for the enduring benefit of the trade I think that there is very good reason for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital The Act opens with the preamble whereas it is expedient to provide for the registration and more effective protection of trade marks Section of the Act defines a trade mark as meaning a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person He argued that before the Trade Marks Act although the proprietor of a trade mark could maintain an action for infringement of his trade mark and the cause of action in such a case was quite different from the cause of action in an action for passing off goods by the Trade Marks Act the right of the owner of the trade mark is in creased by section and it is made assignable independ ently of the goodwill under sections and of the Trade Marks Act The question thus resolves itself into whether by reason of these two incidents the case falls within the principle laid down by Lord Chancellor <NAME> as mentioned above In our opinion the contention urged on behalf of the appellant must fail It has been said that registration is in the nature of collateral security furnishing the trader with a cheaper and more direct remedy against infringers Cancel the registration and he has still his right enforceable at common law to restrain the piracy of his trade mark In this connec tion it may be useful to notice that expenditure incurred by a company in defending title to property is not considered expense of a capital nature it is there stated that where a sum of money is laid out for the acqui sition or the improvement of a fixed capital asset it is attributable to capital but if no alteration is made in the fixed capital asset by the payment then it is properly attributable to revenue being in substance a matter of maintenance the maintenance of the capital structure or the capital asset of the company That is only an additional and incidental facility given to the owner of the trade mark The Attorney General relied on these observations to point out that the permanence of the advantage was thus not dependent on the number of years for which it was to enure for the benefit of the proprietor of the trade mark In our opinion these observations have to be read in the context in which they have been made
