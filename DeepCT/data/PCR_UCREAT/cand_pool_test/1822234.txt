In this batch of writ petitions under article of the Constitution the petitioners challenge the validity of the orders made by the Commissioner of Income tax under section of the Income tax Act for short the Act On October she submitted another letter stating thus In continuation of my letter dated October I write to inform you that my father at the time of marriage paid the cash to me My husband <NAME> is an assessee and paying income tax Thereafter it was brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Income tax that the income of these assesses has been invested in the business of their husbands The Commissioner issued a notice dated October calling upon the petitioner to show cause why the assessments should not be set aside with a direction to the Income tax Officer to re do the same in accordance with law On October the petitioner filed her objection raising various contentions After hearing the petitioner and considering her contentions the Commissioner formed prima facie opinion that the returns filed by the assessee did not disclose her circulating capital for any of the five years and there was no evidence that she was engaged in the money lending business He further observed thus Any Income tax Officer who does his duties diligently would have sat up on reading the assessee letter and seeing the assessee returns and would have made elementary enquiries to satisfy himself that there was a business done by the assessee and there was income earned from it as alleged Prejudice can be easily deduced on the facts of her record from the very returns filed by the assessee and the impossible explanations given in her letter and the fact that the assessments were completed in great haste without any enquiry being made in a new case and on the very next day the returns of income were received for the assessment years to With that conclusion the Commissioner set aside the assessments in exercise of his powers under section with a direction to the Income tax Officer to afford an opportunity to the assessee to prove her case and to make the assessments afresh according to law The orders challenged in all these petitions were made by the Commissioner under section of the Act and are appealable to the <ORG> under section of the Act The Act provides a complete and self contained machinery for obtaining relief against improper action taken by the departmental authorities and normally a party who is aggrieved by such action should have recourse to that machinery I do not think that the case on hand falls within any one of these principles However I proceed now to examine the validity of the contentions since counsel on both sides wanted a decision on merits as there are similar cases still pending before the Commissioner The Commissioner may call for and examine the record of any proceeding under this Act and if he considers that any order passed therein by the Income tax Officer is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he may after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made such inquiry as he deems necessary pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or canceling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment No order shall be made under sub section a to revise an order of reassessment made under section or after the expiry of two years from the date of the order sought to be revised The said conditions are that the order proposed to be revised is erroneous and that such order has resulted in prejudice to the interests of the revenue Relying on the above decision Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the assessments revised by the Commissioner could not be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and therefore he was in error in setting aside the said orders Assuming that the income disclosed belonged to the assessee there was no reason why it should be spread over for the past assessment years and why it should not have been assessed for the current year in which the returns were filed Mr <NAME> however contended that after the amendment to section of the Act the assessment in question though made without any enquiry or evidence cannot in any event be said to be erroneous though it might be prejudicial to the interests of the revenue since the Income tax Officer could accept any voluntary return without requiring the presence of the assessee or the production by him of any evidence in support of the return and he need not be satisfied about the correctness of the source of income Section a as substituted by Act of with effect from April provides where a return has been made under section the Income tax Officer may without requiring the presence of the assessee or the production by him of any evidence in support of the return make an assessment of the total income or less of the assessee after making such adjustments to the income or loss declared in the return as are required to be made under clause To that extent at least he must apply his mind and cannot blindly make the assessment while accepting the voluntary return The Commissioner has directed the Income tax Officer to make the assessments afresh according to law after making proper enquiries
