lacs to the fund and claimed deduction of this amount under xv of the Income tax Act as expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business Held that as the deed did not impose any obligation on the bank or the trustees to grant any pension to any employee and the pension even if granted could be withdrawn and even the rules could be completely altered at will by the company no valid trust was created even though moneys had been transferred to the trustees and the sum in question could not be said to have been spent for the purposes of the business and allowed as a deduction under xv The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal from the judgment and order of <ORG> at Calcutta on a reference made by <ORG> under Section of the Indian Incometax Act XI of On the construction of the several provisions of the deed of trust <ORG> held I am of opinion that in view of these provisions of the trust deed coupled with the uncertainty as regards the beneficiaries and the absence of any obligation to grant any pension no legal and effective trust was created and the so called trust must be held to be void It further held that even if the ownership of the money had passed over to the trustees still the further provision regarding the application of the money to the payment of pensions being entirely ineffective and void the money cannot be said to have been expended for the purpose of the business and that therefore was not an expenditure or an expenditure for the purposes of the business within the meaning of section xv of the Act Clause provided for the withdrawal modification or determination by the bank of any pension payable thereunder when in its opinion the conduct of the recipient or the circumstances of the case justified it in so doing and the trustees were bound forthwith to act upon any directions of the bank or of any officers thereof duly authorised by the bank in that behalf On a consideration of the provisions of the deed of trust above set out it is clear that the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf were constituted the sole authorities to determine what pensions and in what manner the same should be paid out of the income of the fund But there was nothing in the terms of the deed which imposed any obligation on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to any such applicant The pension if granted could also be withdrawn modified or determined under the directions of the bank or any officer of the bank duly authorised in that behalf and such directions were binding on the trustees It was open under the above provisions for the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant no pension at all to any officer of the staff who made an application to them for a pension and also to withdraw modify or determine any pension payable to such officer if in their opinion the conduct of the recipient or the circumstances of the case should justify them in so doing <NAME> however urged that the power conferred upon the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf was a power in the nature of a trust that there was a general intention in favour of a class and a particular intention in favour of individuals of a class to be selected by them and even though the particular intention failed from the selection not being made the court could carry into effect the general intention in favour of the class and that therefore the trust was valid He relied in support of this contention on <NAME> Higgs and <NAME> Philcox It is perfectly clear said Lord <NAME> that where there is a mere power and that power is not executed the court cannot execute it But there are not only a mere trust and a mere power but there is also known to this court a power which the party to whom it is given is intrusted with and required to execute and with regard to that species of power the court considers it as partaking so much of the nature and qualities of a trust that if the person who has the duty imposed upon him does not discharge it the court will to a certain extent discharge the duty in his room and place Thus if there is a power to appoint among certain objects but no gift to those objects and no gift over in default of appointment the court implies a trust for or gift to ves As already stated there is no clear indication in the deed of trust that the bank intended the power to be regarded in the nature of a trust inasmuch as there was no obligation imposed on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to any applicant There was no duty to grant any pension at all and the pension if granted could be withdrawn modified or determined by the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf as therein mentioned Under the circumstances it could not be said that there was a power in the nature of a trust which could be exercised by the court if the donee of the power for some reason or other did not exercise the same It will be appropriate at this stage to consider whether any beneficiary claiming to be entitled to a pension under the terms of the deed could approach the court for the enforcement of any provision purporting to have been made for his benefit Even though he may be qualified under clause to apply for the grant of a pension he could not certainly enforce that provision because there was no obligation imposed at all on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to him and in the absence of any such obligation imposed upon anybody it would be futile to urge that a valid trust was created in the manner contended on behalf of the appellant In our opinion therefore <ORG> was right in the conclusion to which it came that there was uncertainty as regards the beneficiaries and there was an absence of any obligation to grant any pension with the result that no legal and effective trust could be said to have been created and further that the provision of Rs In view of the above we do not think it necessary to into the interesting questions which were sought to toe raised by the appellant viz
