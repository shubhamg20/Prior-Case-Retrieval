In the affidavit filed by the respondent she has stated that she was driven away from the matrimonial home and has been living without any food cloth and shelter The respondent thereafter filed a petition in No of invoking the provision under Section of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act seeking to enforce the order already passed in Crl No of alleging therein that the petitioners have locked the premises dishonoring the residence order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate The learned Judicial Magistrate having heard both sides passed an order on directing the police to break open the lock and give protection to the respondent herein to reside in the house He would further submit that the learned Judicial Magistrate has not expressed his satisfaction based on the averment found in the affidavit filed by the respondent that the application did disclose a prima facie case of commission of an act of domestic violence or the likelihood of the commission of the said act As regards the other order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate to break open the lock in the subject house with the assistance of the police he would submit that there is no specific provision under the Act to pass such an order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate The learned Judicial Magistrate should have waited till the petitioners herein file a counter in the main application for the disposal of the interim application filed by the respondent seeking break open But after the matrimonial dispute had arisen between the parties the first petitioner has chosen to alienate the property in the name of the second petitioner on Even otherwise the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent would submit that the house of the second petitioner which is in the permissible occupation of the first petitioner along with her wife shall be treated as shared household The suggestion emanated from the petitioners that they are prepared to offer alternate accommodation can be decided during the disposal of the main application filed by the respondent Therefore there is nothing wrong in the direction given by the learned Judicial Magistrate to break open the lock to accommodate the wife in the house where she last resided The application seeking to break open the lock cannot be kept in abeyance till the petitioners herein file a counter leisurely in the main application It has also been observed therein that the property exclusively owned by the mother of the husband cannot be called shared household as per the definition found in Section of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act In the above case it is found that wife had chosen to file a Suit seeking bare injunction restraining her husband and his mother from dispossessing the wife from the property in question On facts it is observed that the husband of the respondent therein had already shifted his residence to a flat in Ghaziabad before ever the litigation between the parties started Further it is brought to the notice of this Court that after the dispute had arisen between the parties the first petitioner who was the original owner of the property alienated the same in favour of his mother the second petitioner herein On a careful perusal of the impugned order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate in Crl No of it is found that the learned Judicial Magistrate has graphically described the various domestic violence alleged in the affidavit filed by the respondent herein As rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners the learned Judicial Magistrate has not observed in the order impugned that he was satisfied that the application prima facie disclosed that the petitioners were committing an act of domestic violence Under Section of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act the learned Magistrate has to pass a protection order when he is satisfied that the application prima facie discloses that the respondent is committing or has committed an act of domestic violence or that there is likelihood of commission of such domestic violence before ever he passes an ex parte order on the basis of an affidavit filed by the wife What is important is the materials which formed a basis for the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate before passing an ex parte order will have to be considered by the Court and not the parrot like repetition of the provision to the effect that he was satisfied based on the averments found in the application The absence of the phrase Magistrate is satisfied need not be found incorporated in the order passed under Section of the Act Coming to the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate giving a direction to the police authority concerned to break open the lock and give protection to the respondent to reside in the subject house the Court finds that the learned Judicial Magistrate has ample power under Section of the Act to give any order to the officer incharge to assist him in the implementation of the protection order If the submission made on the side of the petitioners that the learned Judicial Magistrate is not empowered to give any order to break open the lock is accepted then in all cases the husband will lock the house and walk off and thereby depriving the wife from enjoying the protection order passed under the Act The impugned order would reflect that the application seeking to break open the lock was filed on and the order thereon was passed on The respondent cannot be made to wait and loiter in the street till the petitioners herein file their counter in the main application Therefore the submission made by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that the learned Judicial Magistrate should have waited till the counter is filed by the petitioners herein in the main application is found not sustainable The Court is all praise for the learned Judicial Magistrate for passing the order at without minding the time considering the emergency in the application filed by the respondent There is nothing wrong in passing an order at that too after hearing both sides
