The point involved in these cases has arisen in a batch of cases which was posted for hearing along with these and the question that is raised for our decision is as to the validity of the levy of sales tax on iron flats iron sheets and iron bars made out of iron scrap which has already been subjected to tax We have heard the various counsel appearing for the petitioners in the entire batch of cases but we render our decision in the above two cases leaving the other cases to be disposed of later on the particular facts The objection to the proposed assessment by the petitioners was that the iron and steel scraps from which rolled mild steel rounds flats and angles have been made had already suffered tax in the <ORG> as first sale of declared goods and that as such rolled mild steel iron flats and angles are not liable to tax as they are declared goods Under Section of the Central Sales Tax Act not liable to tax on second and subsequent sales The petitioners filed the above Writ Petition No of for prohibiting the assessing authority from making any assessment on the basis of the said notice proposing assessment Every dealer other than a casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer whose total turnover for a year is not less than fifteen thousand rupees and every casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer whatever be his turnover for the year shall pay a tax for each year at the rate of three per cent of his taxable turnover Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub section in the case of goods mentioned in the First Schedule the tax under this Act shall be payable by a dealer at the rate and only at the point specified therein on the turnover in each year relating to such goods whatever be the quantum of turnover in that year a pig iron and iron scrap iron plates sold in the same form in which they are directly produced by the rolling mill steel scrap steel ingots steel billets steel bars and rods and i steel plates ii steel sheets iii sheet bars and tin bars iv rolled steel Sections and tool alloy steel Items i to sold in the same form in which they are directly produced by the rolling mill Section imposes certain restrictions and conditions in regard to the levy of tax by the States on the sales of declared goods as enjoined by Article of the Constitution of India Every sales tax law of a State shall in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods be subject to the following restrictions and conditions namely a the tax payable under that law in respect of any sale or purchase of such goods inside the State shall not exceed two per cent of the sale or purchase price thereof and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage where a tax has been levied uiider that law in respect of the sale or purchase inside the State of any declared goods and such goods are sold in the course of inter State trade or commerce the tax so levied shall be refunded to such person in such manner and subject to such conditions as may be provided in any law in force in that State Admittedly the rate of tax has not exceeded the prescribed rate of per cent as the rate of tax levied Under Section read with Schedule II of the Act is only per cent and it has not exceeded the rate fixed in Section a We are concerned herein only with the question whether by levying tax on rolled iron and steel bars and plates etc According to him these words are explanatory of what iron and steel is and all rticles enumerated under that head either in their crude form or in their manufactured stage or in any of the forms listed under the sub headings a and are treated as various forms of iron and steel It is said that the statute contemplates a single point tax in the series of sales of all forms mentioned under the heading iron and steel and that it does not contemplate a single point among the series of sales of Articles in various forms mentioned in a and of item iv The learned counsel also brought to our notice an explanatory note issued by <ORG> <ORG> by their letter No dated st July which detailed the following items as falling within item iv iron and steel The learned counsel is willing to concede that iron and steel scrap and ingots may be commercially different from the rolled plates bars and sheets as produced by the petitioners and that the local Act may treat them as different AQrticles for purpose of single point tax so long as there is no prohibition as the one contained in Section of the Central Act But it is said that once a prohibition has come into existence in the form of Section of the Central Act it is not possible for the local Act to treat sales of different forms of iron and steel as constituting separate series of sales for the purpose of levying single point tax Under Section of the local Act and that if the State were to treat the sales of various forms of iron and steel mentioned under sub items a and as separate series of sales of different commodities and subject them to tax in all its forms it will be contravening the mandate of single point provided in Section of the Central Sales Tax Act Mr <NAME> learned counsel for some of the petitioners however contends that the various forms of iron and steel following the words that is to say in item cannot be treated as different Articles and that whatever the form of the Articles be it continues to be iron and steel Mr <NAME> refers to the other items of declared goods mentioned in Section of the Central Act to substantiate his con tention that a single point has to be fixed for the series of sales in all forms of Articles mentioned under the entry The learned Judges took the view that iron and steel used as raw materials for manufacturing other goods also are exempted from taxation that scrap iron purchased by the assessee was merely re rolled into bars flats and plates that the process was only for convenience of sale and for making them attractive and in acceptable forms and that by the process of re rolling their character as iron and steel is not lost holding that when steel is rolled into rolled steel Sections the outcome is a different and a new commodity that when it is sold there is a sale of a different commodity and not a sale of steel over again and that when sales tax is levied on the sale of rolled steel Sections it is not levied second time or at the second stage on the same commodity in the same condition In their view till st October the State can levy tax at one stage in respect of purchases of declared goods inside the State made by a dealer for use by him in the manufacture of goods and that from st October the State was enabled to levy tax at any one stage as it chooses It was also contended by the learned counsel that the object of the statute should be effectuated and that cannot be done if each sub item in item iv is treated as an independent item for purpose of levying single point tax It is urged that when vanaspati which is produced from groundnut oil after chemical process is treated as groundnut oil rolled iron and steel Sections which are made out of iron and steel scrap into certain presentable and usable forms will not cease to be iron and steel He also contends that the words that is to say following iron and steel in entry iv of Section of the Central Act cannot be said to be explanatory but that it should be construed as restrictive of the scope of the words iron and steel But it is found that the majority view was that corrugated iron sheets were merely iron in another shape and form that it cannot be regarded as an Article or product manufactured or fabricated out of iron that merely because iron is given the shape of sheet and is subject to corrugation for the purpose of giving it rigidity and increased stiffness so as to make it acceptable to a particular class of persons who might want to use it in the form of iron sheet for roofing and walling it does not cease to be iron and it merely assumes another form namely that of a wrinkled sheet but it still continues to retain the essential character of iron In view of the fact that the factual question whether the iron and steel scrap had suffered tax at the purchase stage has to be investigated we have to dismiss the writ petitions after expressing our view on the legal question giving liberty to the assessing authority to ascertain the actual factual position and to proceed with the assessment if any in accordance with law
