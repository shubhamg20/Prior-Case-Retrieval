HEADNOTE What fell for consideration in all these matters viz There were six original proceedings initiated by various parties which gave rise to these civil appeals special leave petitions and transferred cases before this <ORG> On th February one <NAME> filed a suit in the court of the Third Additional Civil Judge Kanpur praying inter alia that Shri <NAME> should not preside over the th annual general meeting of the company In the appeal preferred by the plaintiff before <ORG> an order was passed by <ORG> on nd March appointing <NAME> as the Chairman of the said annual general meeting On th February another suit Suit No of was filed in <ORG> by <NAME> for a declaration that <ORG> and <ORG> had no right in respect of of the share holdings in <ORG> and that the said shares were vested in the <ORG> by virtue of the said Act By order dated th March <ORG> disposed of that application and granted injunction restraining defendants Nos and in that suit from exercising any right whatsoever attached to the shares of defendant No held by them and particularly any voting right in the annual general meeting scheduled to be held on the th March till the decision of the suit This <ORG> also vacated the operative portion of the directions contained in the order dated th March of <ORG> The High <ORG> passed an order on the th April staying the operation of the said letters It was urged by <NAME> counsel for <ORG> and Manufacturing Co There was inter connection and inter relation between all the six undertakings The words in the statute must Prima facie be given their ordinary meaning Where the grammatical construction is clear and manifest and without doubt that construction ought to prevail unless there are some strong and obvious reasons to the contrary That intention and therefore the meaning of the statute are particularly to be sought in the words used in the statute itself which must if they are plain and unambiguous be applied as they stand If the fact is borne in mind that these shares were acquired from out of the investments made by these two companies and furthermore that the assets of the company as such minus the shares were negative and further the Act in question was passed to give effect to the principles enunciated in clauses and of Article of the Constitution no doubt was left that the shares vested in <ORG> by operation of sections and of the Act The submission of the petitioners failed to take into account the fact the undertakings other than the Kanpur undertaking also had capital reserve even though there was no obligation that these were excluded assets in respect of other undertakings and there were no figures of investments therein The <ORG> could not find that there was any special intention to exclude the shares in this case as seen from the existence of at least four other Acquisition Act which used identical phraseology in sections and and the other sections as well Aluminium Corporation of India Ltd Even assuming that the expression pertaining to appearing in the first limb of section means forming part of it would mean that only such assets as had a direct nexus with the textile mills would fall under the first limb of section It had to be borne in mind that the net wealth of the company at the time of take over was negative hence sections and could be meaningfully read if all the assets including the shares were considered to be taken over by the acquisition Accordingly the shares in question were vested in the <ORG> and it had right over the said per cent of the share holdings Irrespective of any order passed by any court the th annual general meeting should be held in accordance with law to be presided over by <NAME> recognising <ORG> as the rightful owner of the disputed shares The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> What falls for consideration in all these matters is a common question of law namely whether equity shares in the two companies i shares in <ORG> and shares in <ORG> held by <ORG> vest in <ORG> under Section of <ORG> Company Limited Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings Act hereinafter referred to as the Act In order to appreciate the question in these matters it has to be borne in mind that there were six original proceedings initiated by various parties which gave rise to these civil appeals special leave petitions and the transferred cases to this <ORG> These six original proceedings are as follows On th of February Suit No of was filed before <ORG> by one <NAME> against Dr <NAME> <ORG> and others praying for an order of injunction restraining the company from holding the th annual general meeting on the ground that shares in <ORG> have vested in <ORG> briefly referred to as <ORG> in view of sections and of the said Act On th of February the application for interim injunction filed in the said suit was dismissed by the learned trial Judge In appeal which is not yet numbered preferred by the plaintiff before <ORG> an order was passed by the <ORG> on nd March appointing <NAME> as the Chairman of the said annual general meeting On th of February another suit being Suit No of was filed in <ORG> by one <NAME> praying inter alia for a declaration that <ORG> and <ORG> had no right in respect of of the shareholdings in <ORG> and that the said shares were vested in <ORG> by virtue of the said Act He granted injunction restraining the defendants Nos and in that suit from exercising any right whatsoever attached to shares of defendant No held by them and particularly any voting rights in the annual general meeting which was scheduled to be held on th of March till decision of that suit On th of March on that <ORG> this Court passed an order directing that <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> all shall be entitled to vote at the annual general meeting and the question as to who were the rightful voters would be decided by the Chairman of the meeting On th March this Court passed orders in this special leave petition directing that the meeting would be held under the Chairmanship of <NAME> notwithstanding any order made by any court including the order dated rd March passed by <ORG> of <ORG> This Court also vacated the operative portion of the directions contained in the order dated th March passed by <ORG> <ORG> of the High Court Lucknow Bench passed an order on th of April staying the operation of the said letters addressed by <ORG> to the companies The main thrust of <NAME> contention who appeared on their behalf was that section of the Act provided that every textile undertaking and right title and interest of the company i <ORG> vested in <ORG> It is common ground that whether a particular asset is part of the textile undertaking and vests under section or not has to be considered in the context of the Act with reference to the language used in section of the Act <NAME> submitted that there are different modes by which <ORG> can resort to nationalisation He referred to the order dated th of April issued by <ORG> under section AA of the Industries Development and Regulation Act hereinafter referred to as the IDR Act This order did not purport to take over those shares held in the two companies by <ORG> He also drew our attention to Volume III pages and of the present volumes before us which is the reply of the Minister of Law Justice and Company Affairs He drew our attention to the letter dated th of April from the Chairman <ORG> in answer to a letter by the Director <ORG> stating that the shares in question and the voting rights in respect thereof continued to vest in the company i <ORG> in spite of the taken over of the management There it was observed that the fact that shares had been pledged in favour of <ORG> would not make any difference In that context it was observed that <ORG> Government of India rightly expressed its view in the letter written by the Director in <ORG> on th of April to the Chairman of <ORG> that the voting rights in respect of these shares continued to vest with <ORG> and the manner in which those voting rights were to be exercised was to be determined by <ORG> of <ORG> It was further observed that <ORG> had in that case rightly treated the registered holder i <ORG> as the owner of the shares in question and to call the meeting in accordance with the notice issued under section of the Companies Act As good deal of reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioners on this decision it must be emphasised that the decision must however be understood in the context of the facts and the language used in the order passed under section AA of the IDR Act whereby only the management had been taken over and not the rights of the company therein Reliance was also placed before us on the decision of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of <ORG> held that the shares did not vest in the <ORG> under the order dated th of April issued under section AA of the IDR Act We cannot attach much significance to that fact as <NAME> sought us to do He submitted that the Statement of Objects and Reasons showed that the acquisition of the undertaking had to be resorted to since the order of taking over the management of the company issued under section AA of the IDR Act could not be continued any further The preamble to the Act however reiterated that the Act provided for the acquisition and transfer of textile undertakings and reiterated only the historical facts that the management of the textile undertakings had been taken over by <ORG> under section AA of the IDR Act and further that large sums of money had been invested with a view to making the textile undertakings viable and it was necessary to make further investments and also to acquire the said undertakings in order to ensure that interests of general public are served by the continuance of the undertakings <NAME> submitted that compensation payable under the Act was not enough to pay all the dues falling in Part I He drew our attention to the Financial Memorandum of the Bill which showed that the Government would have to pay a further sum of Rs The internal aids according to <NAME> were a long title of the Act which used the expression certain textile undertakings and ensuring contiuned manufacture production and distribution of different varieties of cloth and yarn the Preamble to the Act also emphasises according to <NAME> that the textile undertakings which were taken over under section AA should be continued for purposes of manufacture production and distribution of cloth and yarn He further submitted that the Objects and Reasons appended to the Bill also supported that view section of the Act enumerated only six textile undertakings which alone were taken over by the order issued under section AA sections and also provided an intrinsic aid to the construction of section according to him Section provided that an amount equal to the value of the assets which will vest in the <ORG> would be deemed to be <ORG> contribution to the equity capital of <ORG> and <ORG> shall issue shares to the <ORG> having a face value equal to the amount specified in section the expression pertaining to appearing in section means forming part of Therefore only those assets which formed part of the textile undertakings could vest in the Central <ORG> it was submitted by Shri <NAME> It was for this reason that section of the Act while dealing with penalties used the expression assets forming part of the textile undertakings Dr <NAME> submitted that the Act with which we are concerned uses the expression pertaining to in section which according to him is narrower than the expression in relation to used in section of the Coal mines Nationalisation Act He referred to Entries and of the Schedule to the Coal mines Nationalisation Act The expression relating to and pertaining to are words of limitation and they cannot be so construed as to take within their fold shares held by <ORG> an independent company doing its business according to him The scope of the vesting provisions contained in section of the Act would have to be determined per force of its own language employed by <ORG> and not with reference to what transpired either before or after the order of take over of the management dated th April passed under section AA of the IDR Act The textile undertakings referred to in section shall be deemed to include all assets rights lease holds powers authorities and privileges and all property movable and immovable including lands buildings workshops stores instruments machinery and equipment cash balances cash on hand reserve funds investments and book debts pertaining to the textile undertakings and all other rights and interests in or arising out of such property as were immediately before the appointed day in the ownership possession power or control of the <ORG> in relation to the said undertakings whether within or outside India and all books of account registers and all other documents of whatever nature relating thereto An amount equal to the value of the assets of the textile undertakings transferred to and vested in <ORG> under sub section of section shall be deemed to be the contribution made by <ORG> to the equity capital of <ORG> and for the contribution so made <ORG> shall issue if necessary after amending its memorandum and articles of association to <ORG> paid up shares in its equity capital having a face value equal to the amount specified in section Section of the Act deals with the provisions relating to the employees of the textile undertakings Section of the Act provides that the provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act or in any decree or order of any court tribunal or other authority It is the true effect and purport of these sections that requires consideration and adjudication The properties which on the appointed day i with effect from became part of the taken over properties which might not be dealt with in any manner contrary to the provisions of the Act <NAME> appearing on behalf of <ORG> in Transferred Case No of submitted that the present case is directly covered by several decisions of this Court He referred to the following decisions <ORG> Sita Ram Mills Suppl He further submitted that if the amount of compensation declared to be payable to the erstwhile owners of the undertakings acquired was a test for deciding whether a particular piece of property also stood acquired or not then it was submitted that it may be open to the erstwhile owners to contend that even what is expressly stated to have been vested in the <ORG> would not vest in the absence of compensation paid In any event as against the clear words according to <NAME> of section and section read with section the failure to provide for compensation for three out of the six undertakings would not result in three out of six undertakings being not vested in the <ORG> <NAME> counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> in SLP Civil Nos and of submitted that even assuming though not admitting that the expressions pertaining to and in relation to appearing in sub section of section of the Act have limited or restricted meaning by the plain language of section which is the vesting provision read with sections and the shares in question would also vest in <ORG> The expression forming part of appearing in section according to <NAME> is merely descriptive of the properties already vested in <ORG> under section Section of the Act provided that the provisions of the Act including sections and shall be deemed to have come into force retrospectively with effect from and sections and shall come into force at once Thus the properties which stood vested in <ORG> with effect from already formed part of the textile undertakings on the date of the Act when section came into force i Section containing the penalty provisions could therefore validly and justifiably be given effect to after it came into force on when the Act was enacted The second part of section provided that for the contribution so made by the <ORG> <ORG> shall issue to the <ORG> paid up shares in its equity capital having a face value equal to the amount specified in section Before we deal with the main question we have to consider the application made by <NAME> for production of certain documents It was further urged that even if to consture the language is not clear and there is need to resort to aids of construction it is clear that such aids can be either internal or external In our opinion the language used in section of the Act is clear enough read with section of the Act But from the circumstance under which managements of these mills were taken over it was clear that the <ORG> had taken the decision contrary to what was contained in the <ORG> Report Here there is no real doubt on an informed basis as we shall indicate hereafter about the real meaning of the enactment There is therefore no question of resolving the doubt It has to be reiterated however that the objects and reasons of the Act should be taken into consideration in interpreting the provisions of the statute in case of doubt at suggests The fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his intention at the time when the law was made by signs most natural and probable It is trite saying that the interpreter of the statute must take note of the well known historical facts In conventional language the interpreter must put himself in the arm chair of those who were passing the Act i the Members of the <ORG> We are conscious that there is no sacrosanct rule about the immunity from production of documents and the privilege should not be allowed in respect of each and every document We may refer to the following observations at page of the report It is settled law and it was so clearly recognised in <NAME> case supra that there may be classes of documents which public interest requires should not be disclosed no matter what the individual documents in those classes may contain or in other words the law recognises that there may be classes of documents which in the public interest should be immune from disclosure There is one such class of documents which for years has been recognised by the law as entitled in the public interest to be protected against disclosure and that class consists of documents which it is really necessary for the proper functioning of the public service to withhold from disclosure <ORG> <ORG> Law Reports and indeed any documents which relate to the framing of government policy at a high level vide re Reference may also be made to the observations of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> and others Secretary of <ORG> and another All at The expression textile undertaking has been defined in section to mean the six textile undertakings of the company specified therein In the context of the expression textile undertakings employed in section of the Act section provides that the textile undertakings referred to in section shall be deemed to include all assets rights leaseholds powers authorities and privileges and all property movable and immovable including lands buildings workshops stores investments and book debts pertaining to the textile undertakings and all rights and interests in or arising out of such property as are immediately before the appointed day in the ownership possession power or control of the company in relation to all six undertakings The expressions pertaining to in relation to and arising out of used in the deeming provision are used in the expansive sense as per decisions of courts meanings found in standard dictionaries and the principles of broad and liberal interpretation in consonance with Article and of the Constitution The words arising out of have been used in the sense that it comprises purchase of shares and lands from income arising out of the Kanpur undertaking In this connection reference may be made to Corpus Juris Secundum at pages and where it is stated that the term relate is also defined as meaning to bring into association or connection with This Court rejected one of the grounds of challenge as there was no evidence that the named banks held any assets for any distinct non banking business which finding gives an idea as to what could have been excluded from the acquisition of the undertaking the amount mentioned is specified in the first schedule as there are a number of companies involved It appears to us from the Delhi High Court decision supra and the decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra as well as the statement of the Minister in December that there were legal difficulties in respect of taking over under the IDR Act The IDR Act was a concerned with the management of scheduled industries in inter alia running of factories where there was no deeming provision in such wide terms it was concerned with setting up of machinery for imposing controls on industrial undertakings see <NAME> and others etc There is inter connection and inter relation between all the six undertakings The words in the statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning Where the grammatical construction is clear and manifest and without doubt that construction ought to prevail unless there are some strong and obvious reasons to the contrary The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature as expressed in the statute considering it as a whole and in its context That intention and therefore the meaning of the statute is primarily to be sought in the words used in the statute itself which must if they are plain and unambiguous be applied as they stand In the present case the words used represent the real intention of the <ORG> as we have found not only from the clear words used but also from the very purpose of the vesting of the shares If we bear in mind the fact that these shares were acquired from out of the investments made by these two companies and furthermore that the assets of the company as such minus the shares were negative and further the Act in question was passed to give effect to the principles enunciated in clauses and of Article of the Constitution we are left with no doubt that the shares vested in <ORG> by operation of sections and the Act The submission of the petitioner fails to take into account the fact that the undertakings other than the kanpur undertaking also have capital reserve even though there is no allegation that these were excluded assets in respect of other undertakings and there were no figures of investments therein The covering letter for these documents page of Volume II itself stated that the provisional balance sheet shows investments which included these shares as part of assets We cannot find that there was any special intention to exclude the shares in this case as seen from the existence of at least four other Acquisition Act which used identical phraseology in sections and and in the other sections as well Reference may be made to page of Compilation III the shares held in <ORG> were acquired in Originally there were four companies and their acquisition has been explained fully in the Compilation III with index the shares held in <ORG> were pledged or attached for running the Kanpur undertaking for payment of ESI and <ORG> dues for the workers of the Kanpur undertaking for wages and for payment of electricity dues of the Kanpur undertaking the shares held in <ORG> were pledged for raising monies and loans of Rs Even assuming that the expression pertaining to appearing in the first limb of section means forming part of it would mean that only such assets which have a direct nexus with the textile mills as would fall under the first limb of section On the construction of sections and we have come to the conclusion that the shares vest in <ORG> even if we read sections and in conjunction with sections and of the Act on the well settled principles which we have reiterated before Section provides for payment of compensation in lumpsum and the transfer and vesting of whatever is comprised in section As section expands the scope of section the compensation mentioned in section is for the property mentioned in section read with section The compensation provided in section is not calculated as a total of the value of various individual assets in the Act In the instant case section provides for compensation to be paid to the undertakings as a whole and not separately for each of the interests of the company After providing for compensation of Rs crores to be paid to the Commissioner for payments to discharge part I liabilities <ORG> has to undertake an additional crores at least for discharging those liabilities It has to be borne in mind that the net wealth of the company at the time of take over was negative hence sections and can be meaningfully read if all the assets including the shares are considered to be taken over by the acquisition We have to bear in mind the Preamble of the Act which expressly recites that it was to ensure the principles enunciated in clauses and of Article of the Constitution Accordingly the shares in question are vested in <ORG> and it has right over the said per cent of the shareholdings In Transferred Case No of in Suit No of we hold that lakhs and lakhs equity shares mentioned hereinbefore and <ORG> at Kanpur and all the rights title and interest attached therewith relate to the textile undertaking of defendant No and they vest in <ORG> with effect from st of April and defendant Nos and are restrained by a decree of permanent injunction from dealing with them in any manner whatsoever We direct that irrespective of any order passed by any court the th annual general meeting should be held in accordance with law to be presided over by <NAME> recognising <ORG> as the rightful owner of the disputed shares
