but the appellants filed writ petitions claiming refund of the remainder of the licence fee paid by them During the pendency of the writ petitions the Kerala Luxury Tax on Tobacco Validation Act of Act of was passed by the <ORG> legislature to provide for the levy of a luxury tax on tobacco and validate the levy and collection of fees for licences for the vend and stocking of tobacco for the period between August and December and it received the assent of the President The appellants then challenged the validity of the Act but the <ORG> on the other hand demanded payment of the part of the fee earlier refunded to the parties The validity of the demand notice was questioned by the appellants on the question of validity of the Act <ORG> held that the levy being in respect of goods produced outside the <ORG> was not an excise duty falling within Entry of the Union List the tax clearly answers the description of luxury tax falling within entry of <ORG> List however the payment of the tax being a condition precedent to the bringing of the goods into the taxing territory it was a direct impediment on the free flow of goods and even so it is saved by Article being reason able tax levied in public interest What was held in that case was that the Cochin Tobacco Act and the similar Travancore Act taken along with the rules framed under those Acts were in substance law corresponding to the Central Excise and Salt Act The liability to pay the tax is on stocking and vending of tobacco There is no provision in the Act which is concerned with production or manufacture of tobacco or which links the tax under its provisions with the manufacture or production of tobacco Where however the levy imposed or tax has no nexus with the manufacture or production of an article the impost or tax cannot be regarded to be one in the nature of excise duty The word luxury has not been used in the sense of something pertaining to the exclusive preserve of the rich There is nothing static about what constitutes an article of luxury But while the <ORG> can impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one <ORG> and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest so far as the <ORG> legislatures are concerned restrictions must satisfy two requirements firstly they must be in public interest and secondly the restrictions should be reasonable AB a Where a topic is not included within the relevant List dealing with the legislative competence of <ORG> <ORG> by making a law cannot attempt to confer such legislative competence on the State legislatures This principle would however have no application where what is sought to be done is to validate the recovery of licence fee for stocking and vending of tobacco Where a challenge to the validity of a legal enactment is made on the ground that it is a colourable piece of legislation what is to be proved is that though the Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the legislature in substance and reality it covers a field which is outside its legislative competence FG a Where the State legislature can make valid law it can provide not only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of the law but can also provide for the retrospective operation of the provisions In judging the reasonableness of the retrospective operation of law for the purpose of Article the test of length of time covered by the retrospective operation could not by itself be treated as decisive The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Whether the provisions of the Luxury Tax on Tobacco Validation Act Act of hereinafter referred to as the Act enacted by <ORG> are void on the grounds that <ORG> lacked the legislative competence to enac that Act and the provisions of the Act contravened article of the Constitution and were not protected by article is the main question which arises for determination in these civil appeals Nos and to filed on certificate against the judgment of <ORG> On April after the Constitution had come in force and Travancore Cochin had become a Part State Finance Act No Section of the Finance Act provided that if immediately before the st lay of April there is in force in any State other than Jammu and Kashmir a law corresponding to but other than an Act referred to in sub sections or of section such law is hereby repealed with effect from the said date In the appellants who were A class licensees filed writ petitions in <ORG> for refund of the licence fee collected from them on the ground that the Cochin and Travancore Tobacco Acts stood repealed by the Finance Act of because of the extension of the Central <ORG>s and Salt Act to Part State of Travancore Cochin <ORG> dismissed the petitions holding that the laws under which the new rules were framed were in force and were valid under entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule The appellants then came up in appeal to this Court It was held by this Court in its judgment dated January reported in Supp SCR that the Cochin Tobacco Act of and the rules framed thereunder as also similar provisions in Travancore requiring licences to be taken out for storage and sale of tobacco and for payment of licence fee in respect thereof were law corresponding to the provisions of the Central <ORG>s and Salt Act and hence stood repealed on April by virtue of section of the Finance Act On July the appellants filed original petition No of in <ORG> for issue of a writ to the respondent State to pay the balance amount of Rs which along with interest came to Rs This Act received the assent of the President on March Original petition No of was filed by the appellants in <ORG> to challenge the validity of demand notice dated January as also the vires of the Act The preamble of the Act reads as under PREAMBLE WHEREAS it is expedient to provide for the levy of a luxury tax on tobacco for the period beginning with the th day of August and ending on the st day of December and the validation of the levy and collection of fees for licences for the vend and stocking of tobacco for the aforesaid period BE it enacted in the Fifteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows Section ii of the Act defines tobacco to include leaf of the tobacco plant snuff cigars cigarettes beedies beedi tobacco tobacco powder and other preparations or admixtures of tobacco Section is the charging section and provides that for the period beginning with the th day of August and ending on the st day of December every person vending or stocking tobacco within any area to which this Act extends shall be liable and shall be deemed always to have been liable to pay a luxury tax on such tobacco in the form of a fee for licence for the vend and stocking of the tobacco at such rates as may be prescribed not exceeding the rates specified in the Schedule Section of the Act gives power to <ORG> to make rules by publication in the gazette to carry out the purposes of the Act Validation Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court all fees for licences for the vend or stocking of tobacco levied or collected or purported to have been levied or collected under any of the rules or notifications specified in sub section or for the period beginning with the th day of August and ending on the st day of December shall be deemed to have been validly levied or collected in accordance with law as if this Act were in force on and from the th day of August and the fees for licences were a luxury tax on tobacco levied under the provisions of this Act and accordingly a no suit or other proceeding shall be maintained or continued in any court for the refund of any fees paid or purported to have been paid under any of the said rules or notifications and no court small enforce a decree or order directing the refund of any fees paid or purported to have been paid under any of the said rules or notifications Recovery of licence fees refunded Where any amount paid or purported to have been paid as a fee for licence under any of the rules or notifications specified in sub section of has been refunded after the th day of January and such amount would not have been liable to be refunded if this Act had been in force on date of the refund the person to whom the refund was made shall pay the amount so refunded to the credit of the <ORG> in any <ORG> treasury on or before the th day of April and where such amount is not so paid the amount may be recovered from him as an arrear of land revenue under the Revenue Recovery Act for the time being in force The appellants thereupon filed appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> against the judgment of the learned single Judge After remand affidavits were filed on behalf of the appellants and the respondent State There being no competing internal goods the mere fact that the levy is only on imported goods can only have like any other tax the economic effect of reducing the demand by reason of increasing the price The consequent diminution in the quantity of goods imported into the taxing territory is too remote an effect to be a direct impediment to the free flow of trade offending article of the constitution So far as the rules are concerned which were issued on August and January this Court held that as the parent Acts under which those rules were issued stood repealed on April there would be no power in the State Government thereafter to frame new rules in August and January for there would be no law to support the new rules No question relating to the validity of the above mentioned Act in the very nature of things could arise at the time of the earlier decision in It has next been argued on behalf of the appellants that the levy for the licence fee for stocking and vending of tobacco even though described as luxury tax in charging section of the Act is in reality and substance an excise duty on tobacco Generally speaking the tax is on the manufacturer or the producer yet laws are to be found which impose a duty of excise at stages subsequent to the manufacture or production see of the judgment of this Court delivered on January in the case between these very parties reported in Supp Where however the levy imposed or tax has no nexus with the manufacture or production of an article the impost or tax cannot be regarded to be one in the nature of excise duty In the light of what has been stated above we may now turn to the provisions of the impugned Act of There is no provision of this Act which is concerned with production or manufacture of tobacco or which links the tax under its provisions with the manufacture or production of tobacco According to that entry <ORG> can make laws in respect of taxes on luxuries including taxes on entertainments amusements betting and gambling The word luxury in the above context has not been used in the sense of something pertaining to the exclusive preserve of the rich It denotes something which is superfluous and not indispensable and to which we take with a view to enjoy amuse or entertain ourselves It is no doubt true that for those who have been lured by the charms and blandishments of Lady Nicotine there are few things which are so soothing to the distraught nerves and so entertaining as tobacco and its manifold preparations It may be added that there is nothing static about what constitutes an article of luxury Any difficulty which may arise in borderline case would not be faced when we are dealing with an article like tobacco which has been recognised to be an article of luxury and is harmful to health The learned Judges in this connection took the view that the levy of tax as a condition preceding to the entry of goods into a place directly impeded the flow of trade to that place We agree with the learned Judges of <ORG> that such levy directly impedes the free flow of trade and as such is violative of article of the Constitution The next question which arises for consideration is whether the levy of tax is protected by article of the Constitution Clause of article empowers the <ORG> of a State notwithstanding anything in article or article but subject to the sanction of the President to impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Article confers power upon <ORG> to impose by law such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest Perusal of article and article shows that while <ORG> can impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest so far as the State <ORG>s are concerned restrictions must satisfy two requirements firstly they must be in the public interest and secondly the restrictions should be reasonable The above observations though made in the context of article have equal relevance under article Taxes are levied usually for the obvious purpose of raising revenue To some extent every tax imposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed but that fact by itself would not make it unreasonable It is well settled that when power is conferred upon the legislature to levy tax that power must be widely construed it must include the power to impose a tax and select the articles or commodities for the exercise of such power it must likewise include the power to fix the rate and prescribe the machinery for the recovery of tax This power also gives jurisdiction to the legislature to make such provisions as in its As observed by Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Maryland the power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of Government and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the Government may choose to carry it In determining the reasonableness of the restriction we shall have to bear in mind the importance of freedom of trade and the requirement of public interest It is also true that no effort was made in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> in this case to show as to how the restrictions were reasonable but that fact would not necessarily lead the court to hold that the restrictions are unreasonable If the court on consideration of the totality of facts finds that the restrictions are reasonable the court would uphold the same in spite of lack of details in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> In judging the question of reasonableness of restriction in the present case we must bear in mind that the levy of luxury tax relates to tobacco the consumption of which involves health hazard The fact that there is no commercial production of tobacco in the area with which we are concerned would show that there is no discrimination between tobacco brought from outside that area and the locally grown tobacco because in fact there is no tobacco of the latter category except that grown on experimental basis Argument has been advanced on behalf of the appellants that the provisions of the Act do not apply to the entire State of Kerala but apply only to those areas which were parts of erstwhile States of Travancore and Cochin In support of the above contentions reference was made to the fact that the Act had been made applicable to the Andhra area and had not been made applicable to the Telengana area The above principle would however have no application where as in the present case what is sought to be done is to validate the recovery of licence fee for stocking and vending of tobacco Where a challenge to the validity of a legal enactment is made on the ground that it is a colourable piece of legislation what has to be proved to the satisfaction of the court is that though the Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the legislature in question in substance and reality it covers field which is outside its legislative competence There were similar Acts in several other States which suffered from the same infirmity and to meet that situation <ORG> passed the Sugarcane Cess Validation Act It was held by this Court that if collections are made under statutory provision which are invalid because they deal with a topic outside the legislative competence of <ORG> the <ORG> can in exercise of its undoubted legislative competence pass a law retrospectively validating the said collections by converting their character into collections made under its own statute operating retrospectively The legislative power was held to include the subsidiary or the auxiliary power to validate law which had been found to be invalid The test of length of time covered by the retrospective operation could nob by itself be treated as decisive Lastly it has been argued that section of the impugned Act is invalid because it provides for payment of an amount which had been refunded in pursuance of the order of this Court As a result of the above we dismiss these appeals but in the circumstances leave the parties to bear their own costs
