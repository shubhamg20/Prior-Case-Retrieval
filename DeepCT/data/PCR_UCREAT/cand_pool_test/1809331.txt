HEADNOTE The Ajmer Sound Amplifiers Control Act was enacted by <ORG> which by Of the Government of Part <ORG>s Act was empowered to make laws for the whole or any part of the <ORG> with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the <ORG> List or in the Concurrent List Held that the pith and substance of the impugned Act was the control of the use of amplifiers in the interests of health and also tranquillity and thus the Act was substantially within the powers conferred by Entry No and conceivably Entry No of the <ORG> List and did not fall within Entry No of the Union List even though the amplifier the use of which is regulated and controlled is an apparatus for broadcasting or communication <ORG> enacted the Ajmer Sound Amplifiers Control Act Ajmer of hereinafter called the Act which received the assent of the President on March The respondents who were absent at the hearing were prosecuted under of the Act for breach of the first two conditions of the permit granted to the first respondent to use sound amplifiers on May and of the Constitution <ORG> had power to make laws for any Part of the territory of India not included in Part A or of the First Schedule notwithstanding that such matter was a matter enumerated in the <ORG> List Section of the Government of Part <ORG>s Act enacted Subject to the provisions of this Act <ORG> of a State may undertake laws for the whole or any part of the State with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List Nothing in subsection shall derogate from the power conferred on <ORG> by the Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for a State or any part thereof If therefore the subjectmatter of the Act falls substantially within an Entry in the Union List the Act must be declared to be unconstitutional but it is otherwise if it falls substantially within the other two lists since prima facie there is no question of repugnancy to a central statute or of an occupied field Where in an organic instrument such enumerated powers of legislation exist and there is a conflict between rival <ORG>s it is necessary to examine the impugned legislation in its pith and substance and only if that pith and substance falls substantially within an Entry or Entries conferring legislative power is the legislation valid a slight transgression upon a rival <ORG> notwithstanding It is equally well settled that the power to legislate on a topic of legislation carries with it the power to legislate on an ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included in the power given It becomes therefore necessary to examine closely how the Act is constructed and what it provides The first section deals with the title the extent the commencement and the interpretation of the Act The last two sections provide for penalty for unauthorised use of sound amplifiers and the power of police officers to arrest without arrant That section prohibits the use in any place whether public or otherwise of any sound amplifier except at times and places and subject to such conditions as may be allowed by order in writing either generally or in any case or class of cases by a police officer not below the rank of an inspector but it excludes the use in a place other than a public place of a sound amplifier which is a component part of a wireless apparatus duly licensed under any law for the time being in force In the explanation which is added public place is defined as a place including a road street or way whether a thoroughfare or not or a landing place to which the public are granted access or have a right to resort or over which they have a right to pass The power to legislate in relation to public health includes the power to regulate the use of amplifiers as producers of loud noises when the right of such user by the disregard of the comfort of and obligation to others emerges as a manifest nuisance to them The pith and substance of the impugned Act is the control of the use of amplifiers in the interests of health and also tranquillity and thus falls substantially if not wholly within the powers conferred to preserve regulate and promote them and does not so fall within the Entry in the Union List even though the amplifier the use of which is regulated and controlled is an apparatus for broadcasting or communication As <NAME> pointed out in <ORG> The <ORG> A power to make laws with respect to a subjectmatter is a power to make laws which in reality and substance are laws upon the subject matter On a view of the Act as a whole we think that the substance of the legislation is within the powers conferred by Entry No and conceivably Entry No of the State List and it does not purport to encroach upon the field of Entry No though it incidentally touches upon a matter provided there Our attention was not drawn to any enactment under Entry No of the Union List by which the ownership and possession of amplifiers was burdened with any such regulation or control and there being thus no question of repugnancy or of an occupied field we have no hesitation in holding that the Act is fully covered by the first cited Entry and conceivably the other in the State List We allow the appeal and reverse the decision and we declare the Act in all its parts to be intra vires <ORG>
