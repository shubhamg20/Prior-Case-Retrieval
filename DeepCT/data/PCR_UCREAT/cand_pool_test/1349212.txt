Notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter as and from the financial year there shall be charged levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both situate in a municipality other than Class IV municipality at the rate specified in the table below TABLE i where the annual letting percentum of value exceeds Rs Clauses ii to not extracted The property tax levied under sub section shall not be leviable in respect of the following properties namely biuildings and lands the annual letting value of which does not exceed eighteen hundred rupees Provided that if any such building or land is in the ownership of a person who owns any other building or land in the same municipality the annual letting value of such building or land shall for the purpose of this clause be deemed to be the aggregate annual letting value of all buildings or lands owned by him in the municipality Counsel has placed reliance on three <ORG> decisions of this Court but those in our view do not support the contention pressed Grievance of a different nature had to be considered in that case albeit founded on a provision similar to that contained in the proviso of section A aforequoted In that case the only contention raised and indeed rejected was that for the purpose of determining the rate at which tax could be charged on house property by <ORG> the basis will be the total amount of the annual letting value of all houses of the same owner in that Municipality and that the rate of tax so determined will be applicable to each of the houses It was not the contention raised or the question decided in that case if any of the houses of the same owner was to be exempted from levy of property tax because the annual letting value of any of the houses was within the exemption limit contemplated However as in Nihalkaran the Bench deciding <NAME> relied on an earlier decision of this Court in Om Prakash MPLJ JLJ and also another decision In that case also it was held that annual letting value of each of the houses had to be assessed separately and the four buildings owned by the petitioner had to be treated as four separate units of assessment A different question was raised in that case about the different modes of determination of annual letting value but it was still held that in so far as rate of tax is concerned each building had to be treated as a separate unit We have no intention to under rate the difficulties that are often encountered in construing a proviso However we may refer appropriately in this connection to the decision in Sundaram AIR SC wherein their Lordships summed up the different purposes which a proviso may serve in different cases If any person owned one or more units of buildings and lands whose total annual letting value did not exceed Rs For the purpose of testing his entitlement to the exemption clubbing of annual letting value of all units of buildings and lands owned by him in the Municipality was contemplated In the preceding para we have already given reasons on the interpretation of the object and language of clause and its proviso for taking the view that the proviso is not an independent and substantive provision and it has to be read as an exception to clause However we may look at the other provisions of the Chapter VII captioned Municipal Taxation embracing sections and A etc As held in <NAME> AIR SC the power to make a law with respect to a tax includes a power to make provisions in the relevant statute with respect to all matters ancillary and incidental to the levy assessment collection and recovery of tax According to section <ORG> may impose a tax payable by the owners of houses buildings or lands situated within the limits of the Municipality with reference to annual letting value of the house building or land called property tax There is no doubt that the Act envisages annual letting value as the single important factor for determining the mode and measure of taxation of all lands and buildings in the Municipality For all the foregoing reasons we answer in the negative the question framed for decision of this Larger Bench Let it also be made clear that even when other units are found taxable because of aggregate of annual letting value exceeding Rs The impugned order passed in appeal by the learned Civil Judge upholding the assessment on houses abovereferred by <ORG> Mungavali is maintained However in facts and circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs
