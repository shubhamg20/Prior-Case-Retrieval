The question raised in this appeal is whether the plaintiff suing for arrears of rent and having been a minor at the time when one portion of the arrears accrued due is entitled to the benefit of Section of the Limitation Act and to bring his suit to recover those arrears after the period prescribed by the law for such suits in general The Subordinate Judge was of opinion that Section of the Limitation Act was not applicable to suits for rent under Bengal Act VIII of under which this suit was brought because that Act provides a special period of limitation for suits brought to recover arrears of rent and the schedule to the Limitation Act provides no period for such suits As suits for rent do not come within that schedule the <ORG> held that that section was not applicable and it appears to us that it was correct in the view which it took There is one authority pointed out to us by the pleader for the appellant as being against him cited to us it was held that the plaintiff suing under special Acts providing special periods of limitation were nevertheless entitled to the benefit of Section of the Limitation Act which provides that if the Court is closed when the period of limitation expires a plaintiff may file his suit upon the first day the Court re opens These decisions may at first sight appear to conflict with the provisions of Section of the Limitation Act which provides When by any special or local law a period of limitation is specially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed And as regards the suit to establish the right of the unsuccessful claimant under Section of the old Code of Procedure we observe that since the decision in that case new Limitation Act have been passed and also a new Code of Procedure and now the corresponding section does not prescribe a period of limitation whereas the present Limitation Act does prescribe a period of limitation for such suits in it third schedule Another argument was addressed to us in favour of the plaintiff based on these facts that a former ex parte decree was obtained when there was no bar of limitation but which ceased to have effect it is said because it was found after decree that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass it and though the sale held under that decree was set aside or not confirmed the defendant it was argued recovered his property saddled with a charge for the rent covered by that decree The appeal must be dismissed with costs
