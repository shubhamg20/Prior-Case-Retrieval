Though in its more recent pronouncements this <ORG> laid less emphasis on compelling reasons the principle has remained the same Once it was found that the High <ORG> applied the correct principles in setting aside the order of acquittal this <ORG> will not ordinarily interfere with the High <ORG> order of conviction in appeal against acquittal enter into the evidence to ascertain whether the High <ORG> was right in its view of the evidence Only such examination of the evidence would ordinarily be necessary as is needed to see that the High <ORG> approached the question properly and applied the principle correctly If the judgment of the High <ORG> did not disclose a careful examination of the evidence in coming to the conclusion that the view of the acquitting court was unreasonable or if it appeared that the High <ORG> erred on questions of law or misread the evidence or the judgment of the trial court this <ORG> would unless the case was sent back to the High <ORG> for re hearing appraise the evidence for itself to examine the reasons on which the lower court based its order of acquittal and then decide whether the High <ORG>s view that the conditions of the lower court was unreasonable was correct <NAME> it is said gave him a Sela thrust in the abdomen <NAME> died on the spot <NAME> was brought to the hospital at Gidderbha the following morning and received some treatment but he also died of his injuries the following day that is the th July In any case he thought <NAME> dying declaration had little probative value because as many as six persons had been named and that it could not be relied upon without corroboration These were the main reasons for which he came to the conclusion that the case had not been proved against any of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly acquitted the accused <ORG> was of opinion that the learned Judge was wholly wrong in holding that <NAME> was not mentioned in the Inquest Report that he had misread the time of the first Information Report as for A and that he was again in error in concluding that the statement made by <NAME> to the police on their arrival at A was inadmissible After pointing out these errors in the reasoning of the learned Trial Judge <ORG> said We have no hesitation in concluding that for the said reasons the judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge is wholly erroneous resulting in complete miscarriage of justice The main contention raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants is that <ORG> had no sufficient reasons for interfering with the order of acquittal made by the Additional Sessions Judge and that <ORG> itself had been guilty of errors especially as <ORG> has misread the judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge and had attributed to him statements which are not to be found in his judgment In many cases especially the earlier ones the <ORG> has in laying down such principles emphasised the necessity of interference with an order of acquittal being based only on compelling and substantial reasons and has expressed the view that unless such reasons are present an Appeal court should not interfere with an order of acquittal In later years the <ORG> has often avoided emphasis on compelling reasons but nonetheless adhered to the view expressed earlier that before interfering in appeal with an order of acquittal a <ORG> must examine not only questions of law and fact in all their aspects but must also closely and carefully examine the reasons which impelled the lower courts to acquit the accused and should interfere only if satisfied after such examination that the conclusion reached by the lower court that the guilt of the person has not been proved is unreasonable But on close analysis it iq clear that the principles laid down by the court ill this matter have remained the same Once the appellate court comes to the conclusion that the view taken by the lower court is clearly an unreasonable one that itself is a compelling reason for interference When <ORG> judgment shows clearly that the matter has been approached in the proper manner and the correct principles have been applied there is very little scope for this <ORG> to interfere with an order made by <ORG> convicting an accused person in an appeal against acquittal The position may however be different if the judgment of <ORG> while indicating its conclusion that in its opinion the view taken by the lower court is unreasonable does not disclose a careful examination of the evidence for coming to such conclusion Or it may appear from <ORG> judgment that <ORG> has erred on questions of law or has obviously misread the evidence on the record or the judgment of <ORG> So unless this <ORG> thinks fit to send the case back to <ORG> for re hearing of the appeal and its disposal in accordance with law it becomes the duty of this <ORG> in cases like these which fortunately are likely to be few in number to appraise the evidence for itself to examine the reasons on which the lower court based the order of acquittal and then decide whether <ORG> conclusion that the view taken by the lower <ORG> on the question of the guilt of the accused is clearly unreasonable is correct While it is true that a general statement is made by both the witnesses as regards all the six accused having attacked both Munshi <NAME> and Hazura <NAME> neither of them has spoken of any particular injury having been caused by Major <NAME> PP itself there is no escape from the conclusion that as stated in <NAME> Examination in Chief was a slip of tongue and the correct time of the record was A and that the fact that it reached the Magistrate at that day may well be due to the fact that the Constable was negligent and took his own time about going to the Magistrate or to some other reason not clear from the record The reasoning of the Trial Judge based on his wrong view about the time of recording of the formal First Information Report that the complainant party was not able to say who the assailants were and so delay was made therefore falls to the ground Just as when a number of persons are mentioned as culprits by a person claiming to be an eye witness in his evidence in court the court has to take care in deciding whether he has lied or made a mistake about any of them so also when a number of persons appear to have been mentioned as culprits in a dying declaration that court has to scrutinise the evidence in respect of each of the accused Speaking for the <ORG> <NAME> as he then was observed in that case It is settled law that it is not safe to convict an accused person merely on the evidence furnished by a dying declaration without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might well be drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration After pointing out that in <NAME> Case Supra the <ORG> after a careful examination of the facts of that case distinctly came to the conclusion that the dying declaration was not true and could not be relied upon this <ORG> stated in the later case that the observations of the <ORG> in <NAME> case were in the nature of obiter dicta The <ORG> then proceeded to review the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and of the decided cases in the different High <ORG>s in India and in this <ORG> and stated the law in these words that it cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated that each case must be determined on its own facts keeping in view the circumstances in which the dying declaration was made that it cannot be laid down as a general position that a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than other pieces of evidence that a dying declaration stands on the same footing as anotherpiece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with reference to the principles governing the weighing of evidence that a dying declaration which has been recorded by a competent magistrate in the proper manner that is to say in the form of questions and answers and as far as practicable in the words of the maker of the declaration stands on a much higher footing than a dying declaration which depends upon oral testimony which may suffer from all the infirmities of human memory and human character and that in order to test the reliability of a dying declaration the <ORG> has to keep in view the circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation for example whether there was sufficient light if the crime was committed at night whether the capacity of the man to remember the facts stated had not been impaired at the time he was making the statement by circumstances beyond his control that the statement has been consistent throughout if he had several opportunities of making a dying declaration apart from the official record of it and that the statement had been made at the earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties Hence in order to pass the test of reliability a dying declaration has to be subjected to a very close scrutiny keeping in view the fact that the statement has been made in the absence of the accused who had no opportunity of testing the veracity of the statement by cross examination But once the court has come to the conclusion that the dying declaration was the truthful version as to the circumstances of the death and the assailants of the victim there is no question of further corroboration Thus the necessity for corroboration arises not from any inherent weakness of a dying declaration as a piece of evidence as held in some of the reported cases but from the fact that the court in a given case has come to the conclusion that that particular dying declaration was not free from the infirmities referred to above or from other infirmities as may be disclosed in evidence in that case The evidence furnished by the dying declaration must be considered by the Judge just as the evidence of any witness though undoubtedly some special considerations arise in the assessment of dying declarations which do not arise in the case of assessing the value of a statement made in <ORG> by a person claiming to be witness of the occurrence In view of the several defects in the reasoning of the Trial Judge it is necessary for us to examine the evidence on the record to see whether <ORG> was right in thinking that the view taken by the learned Judge was clearly unreasonable We see no reason to doubt the truth of his statement that he did reach Dhurkot shortly after midnight of the rd July and that when on hearing that a murder had taken place near the Dharamshala he came to the Dharamshala <NAME> who was lying injured on a cot there made a statement to him he recorded the statement correctly Whether or not <NAME> could have made a mistake about the identity of the other assailants or could have implicated some of them at least falsely it will be unreasonable to think that he would substitute another person for the one assailant who gave him the fatal blow Even if there was no other evidence on the records as regards the part taken by the appellant <NAME> this dying declaration of <NAME> is so clearly true that the only reasonable view for a judge of facts to take is that <NAME> caused the death of <NAME> by striking him with a Sela As has already been noticed <NAME> in this statement mentioned <NAME> as the person who gave the first blow to <NAME> the blow which caused one of the injuries on his chest In this statement also he mentioned <NAME> and the other accused persons as having taken part in the attack But it will be noticed that there is nothing in this latter statement which detracts from the truth of the earlier statement made shortly after the occurrence to the police sub Inspector While there is nothing in law which requires the statement of witnesses to be recorded in the Inquest Report it appears to be a common practice in Punjab for police officers to record statements of witnesses in Inquest Reports It is also difficult to understand <NAME> statement that he left the place as soon as some neighbours came up after the occurrence and did not go back to the spot till he was called by the police On an examination it seems to us quite likely that <NAME> also accompanied <NAME> when the latter followed <NAME> towards the Dharmashala and it also seems to us improbable that he would give the main part in the assault falsely to <NAME> if somebody else was responsible for the blow which caused <NAME> death Apart from Bhag <NAME> only Hira <NAME> has ascribed any specific part to Major <NAME> in addition to saying generally that he took part in the attack We therefore allow the appeal of Major <NAME> set aside the order of conviction and sentence made against him by <ORG> and restore the order of acquittal made by <ORG>
