September it is stated that contributions were claimed from the archakas on the ground that the temple had been improved and that they had been getting a larger income that for sometime they had been making a lump payment of Rs that they had latterly been paying varying amounts for the expenses of certain new festivals that they preferred to have a fixed XXVIII shows that when that turn was let out in auction there was keen competition and the highest bidder agreed to pay as much as Rs There are certain duties to be performed at Tirumalai shrine on the hills grouped under the heading Bokkasam III that he had nothing to do with the Tiruchanur temple These two circumstances are strongly relied on by the archakas in support of their plea that there is no connection whatever between the Tiruchanur archakaship as such and the Bokkasam service on Tirumalai and that though Ramaswami was doing the Bokkasam service till his death it was not in his capacity as an archaka of the Tiruchanur temple We shall deal with this contention in due course About this time <NAME> turn of duty in the Padmavati shrine was approaching and he applied that a muchilika and security bond might as usual be taken from him and he might be permitted to perform his duty A No of arises out of this suit which was transferred to the <ORG><ORG><ORG> to be tried along with the other suit and renumbered in the <ORG><ORG><ORG> as No of CC that a muchilika and security bond must be taken from him as usual and he be permitted to attend to his duty The Court below found in favour of the will and of the adoption and as these findings have not been attacked in the course of the argument before us our judgment proceeds on the footing that <NAME> the first respondent in A No is the validly adopted son of the deceased <NAME> There is again no question here of the alienation being intended or calculated to alter the form of worship <NAME> Srinivasa Aiyangar It is true that in the <NAME> <NAME> I A I Mad But once the principle of appointment or selection was ignored and hereditary rights including those of woman were recognised the next step was to bring in the practice of partition and we have not been referred to any reported case where that decision has been dissented from on similar facts XXI and XXXVI respectively are of very little value when there is nothing else to show that their branch had ever been discharging these duties and they had admittedly not performed these duties since There is no doubt on the evidence that offerings and all other sources of income received in this shrine have all along gone to the <NAME> and the archaka whoever he was has been paid a fixed monthly salary There is nothing to support the suggestion that in doing duties as archakas at the new shrine and his father merely acted as deputies for the archakas of <NAME> shrine It makes reference to <NAME> in this connection though it is not clear how in the face of evidence <NAME> could have been doing duty at the new shrine on the date of <ORG> The plaintiff in the suit of examined as admits that for sometime after the prathishta puja was got done by some persons who were strangers to the mirasi families that he himself took over the archakaship on a kind of lease from the <NAME> for a period of five years that when he applied again for a further lease it has been refused and a contract given to somebody else XXIII that on certain terms the <NAME> of Sri Sundararajaswami may be given to the petitioners It is also significant that no claim was made in the plaint in the earlier suit i suit of A No in respect of this temple On behalf of the Devasthanam it has been contended that all these offerings prima facie belong to the deity that the archakas are only entitled to a reasonable remuneration for their services that the existing arrangement is and must at any rate be deemed to be only a temporary one subject to revision by the Vicharanakartha from time to time and that if regarded as permanent it will not be binding on the temple the suit was brought to set aside what purported in terms to be a perpectual lease granted by the Devasthanam committee to the archakas in and though the learned Judges refer to the older practice they proceed on the footing that the transaction amounted to a permanent assignment or appropriation of trust property by a trustee The relevant decisions take care to make an express reservation in favour of usages in each temple and unless there is anything clearly opposed to public policy Courts will not be justified in setting aside an arrangement which has been in vogue for more than a hundred years And we cannot accept the extreme contention of Mr <NAME> that the execution of annual muchilikas by <ORG> shows that the arrangement is only a renewable annual arrangement We know from the evidence and the muchilikas definitely say that the right is a mamool right We are unabie to award this claim to the temple on the strength of the evidence of a few of the who say that such was their secret intention when they made payments for <NAME> or <NAME> We shall deal with this matter when dealing with the connected CM we agree with the conclusion of the learned Subordinate Judge as to the relative rights of the archakas and the Devasthanam in respect of Kanukas Mr <NAME> drew our attention to the fact that the decree of the lower Court does not even provide for the annual contribution of Rs There is no justification for disallowing a contribution which the archakas have without objection been making for a long time but we need not discuss this matter at length as the archakas have agreed before us to be bound by the terms of Ex These two matters will be made clear by a specific reference thereto in the decree The appellant will also be entitled to credit in respect of the sums paid by the <NAME> first defendant to the plaintiffs during the pendency of the suit in pursuance of the consent order of February in No of in No of on the file of the lower <ORG> and also the sum of Rs The parties also agree that in the decrees in both the appeals the words jewels and gold and silver articles other than vessels may be substituted for the words gold and silver articles and jewels in the second paragraph of the lower Court decree
