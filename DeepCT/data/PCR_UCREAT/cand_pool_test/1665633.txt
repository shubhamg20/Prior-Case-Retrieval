It had long been regarded as well settled in this <ORG> that the starting point under Article was the date of the appellate decree and there is a decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I All which strongly supports that view The question then arose in execution as to the date from which mesne profits should be calculated under the provisions of Section of the Old Code Act XIV of and their Lordships observed at page The <ORG> is now executing not the District Judge decree of but the Queen Order of which by affirming the District Judge decree has adopted its terms and has carried on their effect down to a later date If the date of the final decree was the proper date to have regard to for the purposes of Section Civil Procedure Code it follows that it is equally the proper date to have regard to with reference to an application for a decree absolute under Order XXXIV Rule Assuming that Article was the article applicable <ORG> held that consideration failed when the sale itself was set aside in the first Court that time then began to run under Article and that consideration did not fail afresh when the order setting aside the sale was affirmed by <ORG> With reference to this question they observed in accordance with the express provisions of the Code that an original decree is not suspended by presentation of an appeal nor is its operation interrupted where the decree on appeal is one of dismissal but those observations must in my opinion be considered as inapplicable to questions arising under Articles and It would obviously be so if the decree of <ORG> had varied the preliminary decree passed by the lower Court and there are no good reasons for applying different rules as regards questions arising under Article when <ORG> affirms the decree of the lower Court and when it varies it
