No question arose in that case as to the right of the widow and her daughter after her to fill the office and it does not appear whether while they held it they performed the duties in person or by deputy Their Lordships at observe The rule as to the shebaitship being vested in the heir of the founder must from the very nature of the right be subject to the condition that the devolution in the ordinary line of descent is not inconsistent with or opposed to the purpose the founder had in view in establishing the worship and they say later on at page that to allow the plaintiff claim to an admittedly Ballav temple where the rights are performed according to Ballav ritual which it is clearly established they cannot perform would in their Lordships judgment defeat the purpose for which the worship was established On the contrary it seems to me clear from the report that the out of date unshastraic custom obtaining in the South by which Dharmapathnies who are Sahadharmacharinees of their husbands are considered incompetent to pronounce mantrams and do religious duties along with and even solely in the absence of their husbands does not obtain among the Ballavacharya Grossains one of the Vnishnavite sects which are in several respects much more liberal in the treatment of women and birth sudras than other sects though many Vaishnavite sects might have become very degenerate in other respects Though law is not always logical and though the narrow point referred to us relates to inheritance by a person incompetent by reason of sex alone for performing the duties of a religious office I do not think that considerations of the difficulties which are aggressively prominent when we take the four analogous cases of a male heir being incompetent by reason of conversion to another faith when the inheritance opens of his becoming incompetent after the inheritance opens of a female heir being incompetent by reason of conversion before the inheritance opens and becoming incompetent after the inheritance opens can be kept out of mind in deciding the present reference especially having regard to the provisions of Act XXI of Coming to the weight to be given to practice and usage many pernicious and unshastraic usages have crept into the Hindu religions and social systems during dark medieval days and through efflux of time It is on this question that I feel that there is real and substantial difference of opinion between myself and the learned Judges who have considered this question in this <ORG> since I do not think it contains reasons of such weight as to justify a departure from the principle of stare decisis I would answer the question referred to us in the negative
