PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT STATE OF BIHAR DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> GUPTA A SHINGAL CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO SC SC ACT Inherent powers of <ORG> to quash proceedings taking cognizance of the offence when the allegations set out in a complaint or the chargesheet do not constitute any offence Criminal Procedure Code Act of A revision filed under of the Criminal Procedure Code on the ground that the allegations in the complaint did not constitute any offence warranting the cognizance was dismissed in limine On appeal by special leave to this Court HELD Where the allegations set out in the complaint or the charge sheet do not constitute any offence it is compe tent to <ORG> exercising its inherent jurisdiction under of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the order passed by the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence The instant case was clearly one where the allegations contained in the complaint did not constitute any offence and the Sub Divisional Magistrate was in error in taking cognizance of it and <ORG> also ought not to have in the circumstances rejected the application of the appellant for quashing the order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate It appears that at about on st December when the New Year eve was being celebrated at the Club a raid was carried out by the Assistant Commissioner of Ex cise Inspector of Excise and SubInspector Excise and it was found that two women and five men were singing and dancing in the club premises The allegations on the basis of which the complaint was filed are material and we may set them out in extenso A Cabaret dance with women was in progress at <ORG> Patna These allegations according to the appellant did not con stitute any offence and hence the appellant filed an appli cation in <ORG> under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate Patna taking cognizance of the offences charged against the appellant The appellant thereupon preferred an application to <ORG> for leave to appeal to this Court but this application was also rejected by <ORG> on the ground that the allegations set out in the complaint made out a prima facie case against the appellant It is now settled law that where the allegations set out in the complaint or the charge sheet do not constitute any offence it is competent to <ORG> exercising its inherent jurisdiction under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the order passed by the Magis trate taking cognizance of the offence The question which therefore arises for consideration is whether the allega tions set out in the complaint constitute any offence against the appellant Section a provides that if any licensed vendor or any person in his employ and acting on his behalf in contravention of Section employs or permits to be employed in any part of his licensed premises referred to in that section any person under the age of years or any women he shall be liable to fine which may extend to Rs It is an essential ingredient of this offence that the licensed vendor should employ or permit to be employed any women in any part of his licensed premises in contravention of Section We may point out that it was contended on behalf of the appellant that subsection of Section can have no application in case of a person who is holding an OFF licence as distinct from an ON AND OFF licence in form No and since the appellant in the present case was SCI holding an OFF licence he could not be guilty of contra vention of Section sub sect on and hence no question of offence under Section a could arise But we will assume for the purpose of argument that the appellant was covered by Section subsection and he was bound to obey the prohibition contained in that sub section Equally it is difficult to see how the allegations contained in the complaint could be said to constitute an offence under Section That section provides that if any holder of a licence granted under the Act or any person in his employ or acting on his behalf wilfully does any act in breach of the condition of the licence for which a penalty is not prescribed elsewhere in the Act he shall be liable to fine which may extend to Rs The com plaint does not allege as to which condition of the licence was broken by the club or the appellant in allowing a caba ret to be performed in the club premises Nor could the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> point out any such condition of the licence The allegations con tained in the complaint manifestly did not constitute an offence under Section We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order of <ORG> and quash the proceedings in Case No Trial No pending in the Court in Mr <NAME> Executive Magistrate Sadar Patna
