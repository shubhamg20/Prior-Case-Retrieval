of the Evidence Act is necessary only if a witness denies that he made the former statement requires that his attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction But that position does not arise when the witness admits the former statement The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is a simple case though it was argued at great length on behalf of the appellant and a number of technical objections to the validity of the trial taken The appellant <NAME> has been convicted of the murder of one <NAME> and sentenced to death He has also been convicted under section of the Indian Arms Act but we are not concerned with that here from <NAME> who lent him the money and entered the transaction in his ac count book This raises a question which is largely academic in this case because the reason <NAME> was not examined by the Committing Magistrate is that the witness had gone away and was not available and it would have been a needless and indeed unjustifiable holding up of the pro ceedings to wait till he could be found and summoned It is evident that <ORG> has power to examine wit nesses who were not examined before the Committing Magis trate because of section of the Criminal Procedure Code and if the witness is treated as a prosecution witness and examined by the prosecuting counsel instead of by the Court itself that at best would be an irregularity curable by section The learned counsel for the appellant took us elaborate ly through the provisions of Chapter XVIII of the Criminal Procedure Code and stressed in particular section but we need not enter into this because section is a complete answer in this particular case <NAME> and concluded at page with the remark that the question is one of fact in each case and that in his opinion there was prejudice in that particular case The other learned Judge took the same view at pages and and said The <ORG> can of course always use its discretion and allow the production of further evidence section it is evident that the accused has the right to cross examine The appellant was presumably supplied with the witnesses statement to the police or at any rate he had the right to demand a copy under section and if he did not do so It was presumably because neither he nor his two learned counsel wanted it But <NAME> <NAME> concurring after saying that After a careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case I entertain no doubt in my mind that <NAME> and <NAME> have told nothing but the truth went on to say and that <NAME> and <NAME> who made correct statements before the police and before the Committing Magistrate have given false evidence in the trial <ORG> with the object of saving the appellant from the gallows Even if that be so it would make no difference because the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> whom the learned Judges primarily believe is sufficient to afford a basis for the conviction and the mere fact that extraneous matter not necessary for the conviction was also called in aid would not affect In cross examination the witness statement in <ORG> was read out to him and he was asked whether he had made such a statement and he said Yes When that statement is read it is found to tally with his evidence in chief and with the depositions of <NAME> and <NAME> and with the first information report Resort to section would only be necessary if the witness denies that he made the former statement In that event it would be necessary to prove that he did and if the former statement was reduced to writing then section requires that his attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction But that position does not arise when the witness admits the former statement It is true the earlier statement could also have been used for contradicting the version given in crossexamination and in that event if it is in writing the limitations imposed by section of the Evidence Act would have to be observed but the prosecution is not bound to do that But in the case before us there is no need to resort to these subtleties because here the depositions were brought on record and could be used as substantive evidence even if the formalities prescribed by section of the Evidence Act were not observed for the very simple reason that there was no need in this cause to resort to section conceded but it was argued that this was done without drawing the witness attention to the parts of the writing which were to be used for the purposes of contradiction <NAME> said that the statement made by him in the committal proceedings was not read over to him and so did <NAME> There is nothing in this point It was also argued that there was no proper compliance with the provisions We are satisfied that there was substantial compliance in this case Two have been believed and in the case of the other two certain statements made by them in the Sessions <ORG> resiling from statements previ ously recorded in the committal proceedings have been disbe lieved We see no reason to interfere with the sentence of death
