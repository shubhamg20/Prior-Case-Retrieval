Sub section of states that the <ORG> Government shall issue a notification declaring that the provisions of shalt come into force on such date as may be specified in the notification Similarly cl of subsection requires that such termination should be approved by the Vice Chancellor or any officer of the <ORG> authorised by the Vice Chancellor in this behalf Article enacts that all minorities whether based on religion Dr language shalt have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice In a petition under article the petitioner contended that as religious and Linguistic minorities they had a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice as also the right to affiliation The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the above sections The respondent on the other band contended that articles and are mutually exclusive that there was no fundamental right to affiliation or recognition that a minority educational institution seeking affiliation or recognition must conform to the conditions prescribed for recognition or affiliation that unless a law or regulation is wholly destructive of the right of minorities under Art <NAME> <NAME> The content of right under Article differs from content of the right under Article By full <ORG> There is no fundamental right to affiliation But recognition or affiliation is necessary for a meaningful exercise of the right to establish and administer educational institutions as restricting the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice only to cases where such institutions are concerned with language script or culture of the minorities and are the same then the consequences will be that any section of citizens not necessarily linguistic or religious minorities will have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice as the right to establish and administer educational institutions for giving religious construction or for imparting education in their religious teachings or tenets the fundamental right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice will be taken away The consistent view of this <ORG> has been that there is no fundamental right of a minority institution to affiliation The right conferred on the religious and linguistic minorities to administer educational institutions of their choice is not an absolute right Provisions of this section have the effect of displacing the management and entrusting it to a different agency The right to administer is the right to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution Restrictions on the right of administration imposed in the interest of the general public alone and not in the interests of and for the benefit of minority educational institutions concerned will affect the autonomy in administration A The provisions contained in A cannot apply to minority institutions Section of the Act cannot have any compulsory application to minority institutions because it will take away their fundamental right to administer the educational institutions of their choice As soon as the court which is one of the authorities of the university determines that the teaching and training shall be conducted by the <ORG> the provisions of of the Act come into force The provisions contained in A cannot be said to be a permissive regulatory measure inasmuch as it confers arbitrary power on the Vice Chancellor to take away the right of administration of the minority institutions would serve would be that minorities might establish their institutions lay down their own syllabi provide instructions in the subjects of their choice conduct exami nations and award degrees or diplomas Such institutions have the right to seek recognition to their degrees and diplomas and ask for aid where aid is given to other educational institutions giving a like education on the basis of the excellence achieved by them The <ORG> is bound to give recognition to their qualifications and to the institutions and they cannot be discriminated except on the ground of want of excellence in their educational standards so far as recognition of degrees or educational qualifications is concerned and want of efficient management so far as aid is concerned Article confers a right on any section of citizens having distinct language script or culture of its own to conserve the same In case an educational institution is established by a minority to conserve its distinct language script or culture the right to establish and administer such institution would fall both under art The right to establish and administer such an institution is guaranteed by art It is not however permissible to prescribe conditions for recognition or affiliation which have the effect of impairing the right or the minority to The law which interferes with the minorities choice of a governing body or management council would be violative of the right guaranteed by art Bishop Patro JUDGMENT It is permissible for the <ORG> and its educational authorities to prescribe qualifications of teachers but once teachers possessing the requisite qualifications am selected by the minorities for their educational institutions the <ORG> would have no right to veto the selection of those teachers Clause a of sub sections and of A of the Act which make provision for giving a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the penalty to be proposed on a member of the staff of an educational institution is valid Clause of those sub section which gives a power to the Vice Chancellor and officer of the University authorised by him to veto the action of the managing body of an educational institution in awarding punishment to a member of the staff interferes with the disciplinary control of the managing body over its teachers Ile power conferred by this clause is a blanket power Conferment of such blanket power on the Vice Chancellor or other officer authorised by him for vetoing the disciplinary action of the managing body of an educational institution makes a serious inroad on the right of the managing body to administer an educational institution What is objectionable in the section is the giving of the power to the Vice Chancellor to nominate the umpire This would cause an inroad in the right of the governing body to administer the institution A provision which makes it imperative that teaching in undergraduate courses can be conducted only by the University and can be imparted only by the teachers of the University plainly violates rights of minorities to establish and administer their educational institutions Abridgment of the right of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice is writ large on the face of the impugned provisions The right guaranteed to a religious or linguistic minority under art is the right to establish any educational institution of its choice When a linguistic minority establishes an educational institution to conserve its language the linguistic minority can invoke the protection of both the articles If a linguistic minority can establish only an educational institution to conserve its language then the expression of their choice in art a Over the years this Court has held that without recognition or affiliation there can be no real meaningful exercise of the right to establish and administer educational institutions under art In The Kerala Education Bill this Court pointed out that no educational institution can in actual practice be carried on without aid from the State and if they will not get it unless they surrender their rights they will by compulsion of financial necessities In fact every one is not being offered the same package since the condition serves as a significant restriction on the activities only of those who have the fundamental right of the nature guaranteed by art It is contradictory to speak of a constitutional right and yet to discriminate against a person who exercises that right The power to withhold recognition or affiliation altogether does not carry with it unlimited power to impose conditions which have the effect of restraining the exercise of fundamental rights The normal desire to enjoy pri vileges like affiliation or recognition without which the educational institutions established by the minority for imparting secular education will not effectively serve the purpose for which they were established cannot be made an instrument of suppression of the right guaranteed But it cannot be said that by the general laws such as the law of taxation law relating to sanitation etc the <ORG> in any way takes away or abridges the right guaranteed under art A referred to Measures which are directed at other forms of activities but which have the secondary or indirect or incidental effect upon the right do not generally abridge the right unless content of the right is regulated It sounds paradoxical that a right which the constitution makers wanted to be absolute can be subjected to regulations which need only satisfy the nebulous and elastic test of State necessity i Recognition or affection is a facility which the <ORG> grants to an educational institution for the purpose of enabling the students to sit for an examination to be conducted by the <ORG> in the prescribed subjects and to obtain the degree conferred by the <ORG> and therefore it stands to reason to hold that no regulation which is unrelated to the purpose can be imposed If beside recognition or affiliation an educational institution conducted by a religious minority is granted aid further regulations for ensuring that the and is utilised for the purpose for which it is granted will be permissible The provisions of sub section a and of A abridge the right of the religious minority to administer educational institutions and therefore their choice Under the guise of preventing maladministration the right of the governing body of the <ORG> constituted by the religious minority to administer the institution cannot be taken away The effect of the provision is that the religious minority virtually loses its right to administer the institution it has founded The right to choose a principal and to have the teaching conducted by teachers appointed by the management after an overall assessment of their outlook and philosophy is perhaps the most important fact of the right to administer an educational institution There is no reason why a representative of the <ORG> nominated by the Vice Chancellor should be on <ORG> for recruiting the principal or for the insistence of the head of the department besides the representative of the <ORG> being on <ORG> for recruiting the members of the teaching staff The fundamental right of a minority to administer educational institutions of its choice comprises with it the elementary right to conduct teaching the training and instruction in courses of studies in the institutions so established by teachers appointed by the minority If this essential component of the right of administration is taken away from the minority and vested in the university there can be no doubt that its right to administer the educational institution guaranteed under art To require that for terminating the services of a teacher after an enquiry has been conducted the management should have the approval of an outside agency like the Vice Chancellor or of his nominee would be an abridgement of its right to administer the educational institution A blanket power without any guidelines to disapprove the action of the management would certainly encroach upon the right of the management to dismiss or terminate the services of a teacher after an enquiry The Provision contained in this section subserves no propose and there is no doubt that it will needlessly interfere with the day to day management of the institution Every petty dispute raised by a member of the teaching or non teaching staff will be referred to arbitration if it seems to touch the service conditions If the object of an enactment is to compel a minority institution even indirectly to give up the exercise of its fundamental rights the provisions which have this effect will be void or inoperative against a minority institution The price of affiliation cannot be a total abandonment of the right to establish and administer a minority institution conferred by article of the Constitution Section i has the effect of compelling a college to abandon its fundamental rights guaranteed by article of the Constitution as a price for affiliation by the Gujarat <ORG> because it is not permitted to affiliate with any other <ORG> without the sanction of the Government A The only provisions which could have a compulsive effect petitioning college could be and then sections and which would magically convert affiliated colleges into constituent colleges of the <ORG> without the interposition of an option and therefore could be said to deprive the petitioning college of the opportunity to become an autonomous college This provision would have the compelling effect of making it automatically a constituent unit of the University be held to be inoperative against the petitioning college as it cannot affect the fundamental rights guaranteed by article of the Constitution Section of the Act as it stands could have the effect of negativating the right conferred by of the Act by transforming mechanically and by operation of the statute affiliated colleges into constituent colleges so that no question of autonomy could practically arise after that The essence of the right guaranteed by article of the constitution is a free exercise of their choice by minority institutions of the pattern of education as well as of the administration of their educational institutions Both these taken together Where these patterns are accepted voluntarily by a minority institution itself the requirement to observe these patterns would not a real violation of rights protected by article No doubt the rights protected by article are laid down in absolute terms without the kind of express restrictions found in articles and of the Constitution benefits of a statutory right there is no reason why the absoluteness of the right under article of the Constitution is taken away or abridged Article on the other hand guarantees the right of a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions Article gives security to an interest article gives security to an activity minorities to establish an educational institution of a particular type The minorities have a right to establish or not to establish any particular type of educational institution As our State is secular in character affiliation of an institution imparting religious instruction or teaching only theology of a particular religious minority may not comport with the secular character of the State does not grant right of affiliation to such an institution it cannot confer that right on an institution imparting secular general education A A glance at the context and scheme of Part III of the constitution would show that the constitution makers did not intend to confer absolute rights on a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions These instances should be sufficient to explode the argument of absolute or near absolute right to establish and administer an educational institution by a religious or linguistic minority from the absolute words of art Articles and place certain express limitations on the right in art There are also certain implied limitations on this right The system implies order and harmony among the various rights constituting our liberty according to the necessities of each case No minority educational institution can be singled out for treatment different from one meted out to the majority educational institution While balancing these competing interests the <ORG> should give due weight to the legislative judgment Nor should the regulatory power be hamstrung by such concepts as real and effective exercise of the right should not be touched by the regulation or that regulation should not directly and immediately impinge on the right conferred by art Since the right of affiliation is not a fundamental right guaranteed by art there is no difficulty in the <ORG> taking over the teaching in tinder graduate classes The question of minority rights is a very sensitive and delicate one and there are no compelling or coercive considerations which would justify this <ORG> in over ruling its previous decisions and reducing the content of the right given to the minorities Articles and of the Constitution confer separate and distinct rights the right of any section of the resident citizens to conserve its down language script or culture article the right of all religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Article the right of an educational institution not to be discriminated against in the matter of State aid On the ground that it is tinder the management of a religious or linguistic minority Article and the right of the citizen not to be denied admission into an state maintained or state aided educational institution on the ground of religion caste race or language Article The differences between article and are unmistakable while article confers the fundamental right to any section Article confers the right only on minorities the right to conserve language script or culture article deals with the right to establish and administer educational institutions of the minorities own choice There is a fundamental distinction between restriction on the right of administration and a regulation prescribing the manner of administration The right of administration means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of the institutions The right of administration means the right to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution through a <ORG> or body of persons in whom the management have faith and confidence and who have full autonomy in that sphere subject to permissible regulatory measures the right to impart education through one own teachers having regard to their compatibility with the ideals and aims aspirations and traditions of the institution The right includes the right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations about academic qualifications and does not support the contention that the latter article will apply only to educational institutions established by a minority community for the sole purpose of conserving its distinct language or script or culture The words used in article are any section of the citizens having a distinct language script or culture of its own The words used in article Are minorities whether based on religion or language There is no reference to religion in articles in article the reference is only to religion and language and there is no reference to culture But they are a minority based on religion to whom article will apply Under the Constitution only the minorities have been given the fundamental right to establish and administer educational institution of their choice The right to administer means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of the institution Sections and of the Amending Act have the effect of destroying the educational agencies disciplinary control over the teachingandnonteaching staff of the college The right to administer educational institutions of their choice in article which includes the right to impart general secular This article does not confer any right or privilege greater than or superior to that enjoyed by any linguistic or religious majority There is no fundamental right of minority institutions to insist an affiliation by <ORG> The right to administer a minority educational institution was not conceived to be unfettered and absolute The following Judgments were delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The question for consideration is whether the minorities based on religion or language have the right to establish and administer educational institutions for imparting general secular education within the meaning of Article of the Constitution This raises the question at the threshold whether Articles and of the Constitution are mutually exclusive Article deals with right of any section of the citizens residing in India to preserve their language script or culture provides that all religious and linguistic minorities have the right to establish and administer educa tional institutions of their choice Articles and Confer four distinct rights First is the right of any section of the resident citizens to conserve its own language script culture as mentioned in Article Second is the right of all religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice as mentioned in Article Fourth is the right of the citizen not to be denied admission into any <ORG> maintained or <ORG> aided educational institution on the ground of religion caste race or language as mentioned in Article It will be wrong to read Article as restricting the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice only to cases where such institutions are concerned with language script or culture of the minorities First Article confers the fundamental right on any section of the citizens which will include the majority section whereas Article confers the right on all minorities Second Article is concerned with language script or culture whereas Article deals with minorities of the nation based on religion or language third Article is concerned with the right to conserve language script or culture where as Article deals with the right to establish and administer educational institutions of the minorities of their choice A minority may administer an institution for If rights under Articles and are the same then the consequence will be that any section of citizens not necessarily linguistic or religious minorities will have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice has been conferred on religious and linguistic minorities so that the majority who can always have their rights by having proper legisla tion do not pass a legislation prohibiting minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice If the scope of Article is made an extension of the right under Article as the right to establish and administer educational institutions for giving religious instruction or for imparting education in their religious teachings or tenets the fundamental right of minorities to establish and administer educational institution of their choice will be taken away The <ORG> this <ORG> said that Article covers institution imparting general secular education All persons whether in the majority or in the minority have the right under Article freely to profess practice and propagate religion Article gives the right to linguistic minorities as well where no question of religion arises is a corollary to the right guaranteed under Article Article is a general protection given to sections of citizens to conserve their language script or culture Article is a special right to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice If religious or linguistic minorities are not given protection under Article to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice they will feel isolated and separate The second question which arises for consideration is whether religious and linguistic minorities who have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice have a fundamental right to affiliation It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that the right to establish educational institutions of their choice will be without any meaning if affiliation is denied The respondents pose the question whether educational institutions established and administered by minorities for imparting general secular education have a fundamental right to be affiliated to a statutory <ORG> on terms of management different from those applicable to other affiliated colleges The consistent view of this Court has been that there is no fundamental right of a minority institution to affiliation Any law which provides for affiliation on terms which will involve abridgement of the right of linguistic and religious minorities to administer and establish educational institutions of their choice will offend Article Minorities will virtually lose their right to equip their children for ordinary careers if affiliation be on terms which would make them surrender and lose their rights to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under Article All institutions of general secular education whether established by the minorities or the non minorities must impart to the students education not only for their intellectual attainment but also for pursuit of careers The entire controversy centers round the extent of the right of the religious and linguistic minorities to administer their educational institutions In other words the minority institutions want to have the right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations about academic qualifications The right conferred on the religious and linguistic minorities to administer educational institutions of their choice is not in an absolute No teacher was to be dismissed removed or reduced in rank or suspended without the previous sanction of the officer authorised by the <ORG> in this behalf These clauses authorised the <ORG> to take over any aided school under certain circumstances Father <NAME> case supra held that section A of the Bihar <ORG> Act which came into force from March There were other provisions in that section viz Those sections were found by this <ORG> to have the effect of displacing the administration of the college and giving it to a distinct corporate body which was in no way answerable to the institution The minority community was found to lose the right to administer the institution it founded These rulings of this <ORG> indicate how and when there is taking away or abridgement of the right of administration of minority institutions in regard to choice of the governing body appointment of teachers and in the right to administer Withholding aid on terms which demand the surrender of the right of the minority to administer the institution is an infringement of the right under Article The minority institutions have the right to administer institutions The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is that it does not rest on or Proclaim its minority character Regulations are therefore necessary to see that there are no divisive or disintegrating forces in administration As soon as the <ORG> which is one of the authorities of the university determines that the teaching and training shall be conducted by the university the provisions of section of the Act come into force Section of the Act consists of four sub sections The result is that section of the Act cannot have any compulsory application to minority institutions because it will take away their fundamental right to administer he educational institutions of their choice Section of the Act contains four sub sections Section ii of the Act confers power on the university to approve the appointment of the teachers made by colleges Section iv of the Act confers power on the university to co ordinate and regulate the facilities provided and expenditure incurred by colleges and institutions in regard to libraries laboratories and other equipments for teaching and research Section confers power on the university to require colleges and institutions when necessary to confine the enrollment of student in certain subjects In view of our conclusion that sections and of the Act hang together and that section of the Act cannot have any compulsory application to minority institutions it follows that section of the Act cannot equally have any compulsory application to minority institutions It is not necessary to express any opinion on the provisions contained in section of the Act as to whether such provisions can be applied to minority institutions affiliated to a university irrespective of the conversion of affiliated colleges into constituent colleges These provisions are challenged on the ground that this amounts to invasion of the fundamental right of administration The right to administer is the right to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution Restrictions on the right of administration imposed in the interest of the general public alone and not in the interests of and for the benefit of minority educational institutions concerned will affect the autonomy in administration The provisions contained in section A a of the Act have the effect of displacing the management and entrusting it to a different agency In view of the fact that notices were given to minority institutions to appear and those institutions appeared and made their submissions a special consideration arises here for expressing the views on section A of the Act The provisions contained in section A of the Act are that for the recruitment of the Principal and the members of the teaching staff of a college there is a selection committee of the college which shall consist The contention of the interveners with regard to these provisions is that there is no indication and guidance in the Act as to what types of persons could be nominated as the representative Section A states that no member of the teaching other academic and non teaching staff of an affiliated college shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard and until a he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making representation on any such penalty The provision contained in section A clause of the Act cannot be said to be a permissive regulatory measure inasmuch as it confer arbitrary power on the Vice Chancellor to take away the right of administration of the minority institutions The provisions contained in section A of the Act contemplate reference of any dispute between the governing body and any member of the teaching other academic and non teaching staff of an affiliated college which is connected with the conditions of service of such member to <ORG> consisting of one member nominated by the governing body of the college one member nominated by the member concerned and an Umpire appointed by the Vice Chancellor These provisions violate the fundamental rights of the minority institutions The right of a minority to administer its educational institution involves as part of it a correlative duty of good administration and in the light of the view taken on the several aspects aforesaid to consider the validity of certain impugned provisions of the amended Gujarat University Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The attempt on behalf of the <ORG> of Gujarat has been to once again raise the same crucial issues which go to the root of the rights conferred on the minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice and whether the <ORG> could treat the majority and minority educational institutions equally an issue upon which this <ORG> has pronounced in no uncertain terms on earlier occasions In order to avoid giving scope to any such contention being raised we would merely refer to some earlier provisions already held to violate the fundamental rights of minorities guaranteed under Art The right of a linguistic or religious minority to administer educational institutions of their choice though couched in absolute terms has been held by this Court to be subject to regulatory measures which the State might impose for furthering the excellence of the standards of education The report which was made to the President in that Reference it is true is not binding on this <ORG> in any subsequent matter wherein a concrete case the infringement of the rights under any analogous provision may be called in question though it is entitled to great weight this <ORG> expresses its opinion if it so chooses and in some cases it might even decline to express its opinion vide In Re To the extent that this <ORG> has applied these principles to concrete cases there can be no question of there being any conflict with what has been observed by <NAME> <NAME> The decisions rendered on analogous provisions as those that are under challenge in this case would prima facie govern these cases unless this larger Bench chooses to differ from them is the case may be or if there is no suitable person in such college or colleges from other persons removed reduced in rank or suspended by the manager without the previous sanction of the officer authorised by the <ORG> in this behalf A teacher against whom disciplinary action is taken shall have a right of appeal to the <ORG> and the <ORG> shall have Power to order reinstatement of the teacher in case of wrongful removal or dismissal and to order such other remedial measures as it deems fit The governing body shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal The managing council shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal If the governing body or managing council as the case may be disapproves any decision taken by the <ORG> in connection with the management of the private college the matters shall be referred by the governing body or managing council as the case may be to the <ORG> within one month of the date of receipt of the report under sub section who shall thereupon pass such order thereon as they think fit and communicate the same to the governing body or managing council and also to the <ORG> The manager appointed under subsection of section shall be bound to give effect to the decisions of the University and if at any time it appears to the University that the manager is not carrying out its decisions itmay for reasons to be recorded inwriting and after giving the manager anopportunity of being heard by orderremove him from office and appointanother person to be the manager afterconsulting the educational agency In spite of the consistent and categorical decisions which have held invalid certain provisions of the University Act of some of the States as interfering with the fundamental rights of management of minority in situations inherent in the right to establish educational institutions of their choice under Art The Central Government to which notice was given probably realising the sensitive nature of the issue did not put forward any contentions contrary to those that have already been considered and decided by this Court though we had the advantage of the personal views of the Attorney General on some of the aspects of those rights The equality between members of the majority and of the minority must be effective genuine equality We are of opinion that this view is a sound one and the contentions advanced on behalf of some of the respondents in support of the validity of the impugned provisions cannot be accepted He said at There is no doubt no such thing as fundamental right to recognition by the <ORG> but to deny recognition to the educational institutions except upon terms tantamount to the surrender of their constitutional right of administration of the educational institutions of their choice is in truth and in effect to deprive them of their rights under Art The right to establish educational institutions of their choice must therefore mean the right to establish real institutions which will effectively serve the needs of their community and the scholars who resort to their educational institutions In a democratic system of Government with emphasis on education and enlightenment of its citizens there must be elements which give protection to them then there is no meaning in saying that the right to recognise vis a vis minority institutions is not a fundamental right would serve would in that case be that minorities may establish their institutions lay down their own syllabi provide instructions in the subjects of their choice conduct examinations and award degrees or diplomas Such institutions have the right to seek recognition to their de grees and diplomas and ask for aid where aid is given to other educational institutions The <ORG> is bound to give recognition to their qualifications and to the institutions and they cannot be discriminated except on the ground of want of excellence in their educational standards so far as recognition of degrees or educational qualifications is concerned and want of efficient management so far as aid is concerned In the A College case the compulsory affiliation of minority educational institutions to the University which had prescribed a medium of instructions other than the language of the minority a via media was suggested having regard to the formation of the linguistic States throughout India that no compulsory affiliation can be insisted upon which offends the right guaranteed under Arts there is a right to get recognition or affiliation where it is possible in India or minority institutions to preserve their language script and culture This may be regarded in fact as a necessary corollary to the provisions contained in Article of the Constitution which gives to the minorities the right to establish and ad minister educational institutions of their choice minorities able to establish an educational institution can insist on recognition where affiliation is not provided for by the University Act to the educational qualifications awarded by them whether degrees diploma or other certificates which conform to the educational standards prescribed by the <ORG> for the recognition of such degrees diplomas and other certificates KHANNA What is the scope and ambit of the rights of minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under clause of article of the Constitution is the question which arises for consideration in this writ petition filed by <ORG> and another under article of the Constitution Section of the principal Act contained definitions According to section of the Act within a period of three years from the date on which section which dealt with the incorporation of the <ORG> comes into force the <ORG> shall determine that all instructions teaching and training beyond the stage of Intermediate Examinations shall within the area of the City of Ahmedabad and such other contiguous area as the <ORG> may determine be conducted by the <ORG> and shall be imparted by the teachers of the <ORG> The <ORG> shall then communicate its decision to <ORG> which Government may after making such inquiry as it thinks fit by notification in the official Gazette declare that the provisions of section would come into force on such date as may be specified in the notification Section was amended by Bombay Act of as a result of which the words three years were substituted by the words seven years The effect of that amendment was that the <ORG> could take its decision under section of the Act within seven years from the date on which section came into force The petitioners and some others then filed petitions under article of the Constitution in <ORG> on the ground that the powers of the <ORG> and <ORG> under section of the principal Act had got exhausted on November when the period of seven years from the commencement of the principal Act had expired The amending Act came into force on March On receipt of the communication under sub section the State Government may after making such inquiry as it thinks fit by notification in the Official Gazette declare that the provisions of section shall come into force on such date as may be specified in the notification the conditions of their service ii to approve the appointments of the teachers made by such colleges and institutions iii to require each such college and institution to contribute a prescribed quota of recognized teachers in any subject for teaching on behalf of the University iv to co ordinate and regulate the facilities provided and expenditure incurred by such colleges and institutions in regard to libraries laboratories and other equipments for teaching and research to require such colleges and institutions when necessary to confine the enrollment of students to certain subjects vi to levy contributions from such colleges and institutions and make grants to them and vii to require satisfactory arrangements for tutorial and similar other work in such colleges and institutions and to inspect such arrangements from time to time Provided that a constituent degree college or a constituent recognized institution shall supplement such Leaching by tutorial or other instruction teaching or training in a manner to be prescribed by the Regulation to be made by <ORG> A No member of the teaching other academic and non teaching staff of an affiliated college and recognized or approved institution shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges and until a he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making representation on any such penalty proposed to be inflicted on him and the penalty to be inflicted on him is approved by the Vice Chancellor or any other officer of the University authorised by the Vice Chancellor in this behalf No termination of service of such member not amounting to his dismissal or removal falling under sub section shall be valid unless a he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showingcause against the proposed termination and such termination is approved by the Vice Chancellor or any officer of the University authorised by the Vice Chancellor in this behalf Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to any person who is appointed for a temporary period only The petitioners thereupon filed the present petition under article of the Constitution According to the petitioners <ORG> is an educational institution established by a minority and them provisions of sections and of the amended Act are violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under articles and of the Constitution The three main reliefs sought by the petitioners are That sections and of the Gujarat University Act Bombay Act No of as amended by the Gujarat University Amendment Act Gujarat Act No of are ultra vires the legislative powers of <ORG> and or are violative of articles a and and of the Constitution of India That sections A and A as

India That section A inserted in the Gujarat University Act Bombay Act No of as amended by the Gujarat University Amendment Act Gujarat Act No of read with section Clause XXXIX as inserted in the Gujarat University Act by the Gujarat University Amendment Act are ultra vires articles and and of the Constitution of India The following resolution was passed by the <ORG> in the meeting held on March and Lengthy arguments have thereafter been addressed before us on behalf of the petitioners<ORG> the respondents as well as others who have been allowed to intervene We may now refer to some of the relevant provisions of the Constitution to which reference has been made According to clause of article subject to public order morality and health and to the other provisions of Part all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion Article gives a right subject to public order moraltiy and health to every religious denomination or any section thereof a to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes to manage its own affairs in matters of religion to own and acquire movable and immovable property and to administer such property in accordance with law Nothing in clause shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the <ORG> but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The article also contains provision against compulsion for persons attending an educational insti tution recognized by the state or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds to take part in any religious instruction thatmay be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premisesattached thereto Although the marginal note of article mentions protection of minority rights the rights actually conferred by that article are not restricted merely to the minorities Once that is provided those citizens shall have the right to conserve their language script or culture irrespective of the fact whether they are members of the majority community or minority community Clause of article gives right to all minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Those minorities may be based either on religion or on language The word establish indicates the right to bring into existence while the right to administer an institution means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of the institution The words of their choice qualify the educational institutions and show that the educational institutions established and administered by the minorities need not be of some particular class the minorities have the right and freedom to establish and administer such educational institutions as they choose Before we deal with the contentions advanced before us and the scope and ambit of article of the Constitution it may be pertinent to refer to the historical background Often you must have heard in various debates in British <ORG> that have been held on this question recently and before when it has been claimed in behalf of <ORG> that they have a special responsibility a special obligation for protection of the interests of the minorities It is in the context of that background that we should view the provisions of the Constitution contained in articles to The object of articles to was to preserve the rights of religious and linguistic minorities to place them on a secure pedestal and withdraw them from the vicissitudes of political controversy The Constitution at the same time expressly guarantees freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion The Constitution makers were conscious of the deep attachment the vast masses of our country had towards religion the sway it had on their minds and the significant role it played in their lives To allay all apprehensions of interference by the legislature and the executive in matters of religion the rights mentioned in articles to were made a part of the fundamental rights and religious freedom contained in those articles was guaranteed by the Constitution It may be apposite in this context to refer to the observations made by <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> The Commonwealth while dealing with section of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act which provides inter alia that the Commonwealth shall not make any law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion In particular they shall have an equal right to maintain manage and control at their own expense or to establish in the future charitable religious and social institutions school and other educational establishments with the right to use their own language and to exercise their religion freely therein The first case was a reference made by the President under article of the Constitution for obtaining the opinion of this <ORG> upon certain questions relating to the constitutional validity of the provisions of tile Kerala Education Bill which had been passed by <ORG> and had been reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the President sub clause of clause and clauses to of Kerala Education Bill or any provision thereof offend clause of article of the Consti tution in any particulars or to any extent Clause of the Bill made the recognition of new schools subject to other provisions of the Bill and the rules framed by the <ORG> under clause Clause authorised the <ORG> to acquire any category of schools Clauses to made provisions for the regulation and management of schools payment of salary to the teachers and the terms and conditions of their appointment It was held that Article of the Constitution made no distinction between minority institutions existing from before the Constitution or established thereafter and protected both It was further held The right of the minorities to administer their educational institutions under Art and of the Constitution override the fundamental rights by employing indirect methods for what it had no power to do directly it could not do indirectly Dealing with the question of <ORG> recognition of the minority institutions the <ORG> held While it was undoubtedly true that there could be no fundamental right to <ORG> recognition denial of recognition except on such terms as virtually amounted to a surrender of the right to administer the institution <NAME> in his minority opinion held that article of the Constitution did not in terms confer a right on the minority institutions to <ORG> recognition nor properly construed could it do so by implication for such an implication if raised would be contrary to the express provisions of article of the Constitution Article was primarily intended to protect such minority institutions as imparted purely religious education and to hold that the <ORG> was bound thereunder to recognize them would be tantamount not only to rendering article wholly infructuous but also to nullifying the basic concept of the Constitution itself namely its secular character was the next case in which this Court went into the question of the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions The petitioners thereupon approached this Court under article of the Constitution on the allegation that the directions issued to them were violative of article and other provisions of the Constitution It was Held by a Bench of six judges speaking through <NAME> as he then was that the rules for recognition of private training institutions in so far as they related to reservation of seats therein under orders of <ORG> and directions given pursuant thereto regarding reservation of of the seats and the threat to withhold grant in aid and recognition of the college infringed the fundamental freedom under article was the next case wherein this Court dealt with the protection afforded by article to educational institutions established by the minorities The petitioners approached this <ORG> under article of the Constitution and contended that <ORG> was founded by Christian minority and they had a right to administer it While the petition was pending section was inserted into the Bihar Universities Act whereby it was provided that the governing body of affiliated colleges established by a minority based on religion or language would be entitled to make appointments dismissals termination of service or reduction in rank of teachers or take other disciplinary measures subject only to the approval of the <ORG> and the Syndicate of the <ORG> The order of the President of <ORG> was set aside by the Secretary to the Government <ORG> by order dated May On June the Regional Deputy Director of Education Bhagalpur addressed a letter to the Secretary <ORG> Bhagarpur inviting his attention to the order dated May and requesting him to take steps to constitute a Managing Committee of the School in accordance with that order A petition was then filed in <ORG> of Patna by four petitioners for restraining the State of Bihar and its officers from interfering with the right of the petitioners to administer and manage the affairs of the school The aforesaid petitioners then came up in appeal to this <ORG> On the above finding the <ORG> speaking through <NAME> as he then was held that the order passed by the educational authorities requiring the Secretary of the School to take steps to constitute a Managing Committee in accordance with the order dated May was invalid Question of the protection of article next arose in the case of State of Kerala etc section provided that the new bodies would be bodies corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal Sub section of each section laid down that the powers and functions of the new bodies the removal of members thereof and the procedure to be followed by them The petitioners challenged the provisions of those two sections as also sub sections and of section which conferred on the <ORG> of the <ORG> the power to veto the decisions of the governing council and a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by their action Likewise the petitioners challenged section which conferred ultimate powers on the <ORG> and the <ORG> in disciplinary matters in respect of teachers section which removed membership of <ORG> as a disqualification for teachers and section which provided that whenever Government was satisfied that a grave situation had arisen in the working of a private college it could inter alia appoint the <ORG> to manage the affairs of such <ORG> it was further held was also right in declaring that sub sections and of section subsections and of section were ultra vires as they fell within sections and that section in so far as it removed disqualification which Petitions were thereafter filed in this <ORG> under article of the Constitution on the ground that the <ORG> bad no power The right of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice it was further held included the right to have a choice of the medium of instruction also As a result of notification issued under section of the Guru Nanak <ORG> Amritsar Act Act of those colleges which were in the specified areas ceased to be affiliated to the Punjab <ORG> and were to be associated and admitted to the privileges of the Guru Nanak <ORG> Arya Samajis were held entitled to invoke the right guaranteed by article because they were a section of citizens having a distinct script they were also entitled to invoke article because they were a religious minority Clauses a and of Chapter of the statutes were struck down by the <ORG> as offending article because they interfered with the right of the religious minority to administer their educational institutions Having done that we should now consider the principle which should be adopted in construing those articles Disputes have consequently arisen and come up before this <ORG> for determining whether the impugned measures violate the provisions of the Constitution embodied in articles and The Constitution and the laws made by civilized nations therefore generally contain provisions for the protection of those interests The right conferred by the clause is in absolute terms and is not subject to restrictions as in the case of rights conferred by article of the Constitution The right of the minorities to administer educational institutions does not however prevent the making of reasonable regulations in respect of those institutions The right to administer educational institutions can plainly not include the right to maladminister The <ORG> can prescribe regulations to ensure the excellence of the institution Prescription of standards for educational institutions does not militate against the right of the minority to administer the institutions Therefore if universities establish syllabi for examinations they must be followed subject however to special subjects which the institutions may seek to teach and to a certain extent the <ORG> may also regulate the conditions of employment of teachers and the health and hygiene of students Yet the right of the <ORG> to regulate education educational standards and allied matters cannot be denied It is therefore as much in the interest of minorities as that of the majority to ensure that the protection afforded to minority institutions is not used as a cloak for doing something which is subversive of national interests At the same time it has to be ensured that under the power of making regulations nothing is done as would detract from the character of the institution as a minority educational institution or which would impinge upon the rights of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The right conferred by article is intended to be real and effective and not a more pious and abstract sentiment it is a promise of reality and not a teasing illusion <NAME> supra regulations which may lawfully be imposed either by legislative or executive action as a condition of receiving grant or of recognition must be directed to making the institution while retaining its character as minority institution effective as an educational institution Such regulation must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it Difficulty however arises in cases which are in the twilight region If a request is made for the affiliation or recognition of an educational institution it is implicit in the request that the educational institution would abide by the regulations which are made by the authority granting affiliation or recognition The said authority can always prescribe regulations and insist that they should be complied with before it would grant affiliation or recognition to an educational institution To deny the power of making regulations to the authority Question then arises whether there is any limitation on the prescription of regulations for minority educational institutions So far as this aspect is concerned the authority prescribing the regu lations must bear in mind that the Constitution has guaranteed a fundamental right to the minorities for establishing and administering their educational institutions Regulations made by the authority concerned should not impinge upon that right Balance has therefore to be kept between the two objectives that of ensuring the standard of excellence of the institution and that of preserving the right of the minorities to establish and administer their educational institutions It has not been disputed on behalf of the petitioners that if the <ORG> or other statutory authorities make reasonable regulations for educational institutions those regulations would not violate the right of a minority to administer educational institutions It must take its colour from the context Free speech does not mean free speech it means speech hedged in by all the law against defamation blasphemy sedition and so forth it means free dom governed by law The First Amendment of the American Constitution provides inter alia that the <ORG> shall make no law respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof The contention advanced on behalf of the appellant in that case that polygamy was a part of his religious belief and the Act of the <ORG> prohibiting polygamy violated his free exercise of religion was repelled Similar view was expressed by <NAME> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> while dealing with section of the Australian Constitution when he said that obligation to obey the laws which apply generally to the community is not regarded as inconsistent with freedom In this respect I am of the view that clause of article and clause of article deal with distinct matters and it is not permissible to circumscribe or restrict the right conferred by clause of article by reading in it any limitation imported from clause of article Article confers a right on any section of citizens having a distinct language script or culture of its own to conserve the same As against that the right conferred by article is only upon minorities which are based either on religion or language The right conferred by article is for the conservation of language script or culture while that guaranteed by article is for the establish ment and administration of educational institutions of the choice of minorities Had it been the intention of the Constitution makers that the educational institutions which can be established and administered by minorities should be only those for conservation of their language script or culture they would not have failed to use words to that effect in article In case an educational institution is established by a minority to conserve its distinct language script or culture the right to establish and administer such institution would fall both under article as well as under article The right to establish and administer such an institution is guaranteed by article and the fact that such an institution does not conserve the distinct language script or culture of a minority would not take it out of the ambit of article It does not say that minorities based on religion should establish educational institutions for teaching religion only or that linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions for teaching their language only What the article says and means is that the religious and the linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions of their choice There is no limitation placed on the subjects to be taught in such educational institutions As such minorities will ordinarily desire that their children should be brought up property and efficiently and be eligible for higher university education and go out in the world fully equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make them fit for entering the public services educational institutions of their choice will necessarily include institutions imparting general secular education also The latter article is a general protection which is given to minorities to conserve their language script or culture The former is a special right to establish educational institutions of their choice The two articles create two separate rights although it is possible that they may meet in a given case It has been argued on behalf of the respondents that there is no fundamental right to affiliation or recognition and that a minority educational institution seeking affiliation or recognition must conform to the conditions which are prescribed for recognition or affiliation It is not however permissible to prescribe conditions for recognition or affiliation which have the effect of impairing the right of the minority to establish and administer their educational institutions Affiliation and recognition are no doubt not mentioned in article the position all the same remains that refusal to recognize or affiliate minority institutions unless they the minorities surrender the right to administer those institutions would have the effect of rendering the right guaranteed by article to be wholly illusory and Indeed a teasing illusion The right conferred by article is a real and meaningful right The right to establish educational institutions of their choice must therefore mean the right to establish real institutions which will effectively serve the needs of their community and the scholars who resort to their educational institutions There is no doubt no such thing as fundamental right to recognition by the <ORG> but to deny recognition to the educational institutions except upon terms tantamount to the surrender of their constitutional right of administration of the educational institutions of their choice is in truth and in effect to deprive them of their rights under Art Argument has been advanced on behalf of the respondents that unless a law or regulation is wholly destructive of the right of minorities under article the same would not be liable to be struck down According to that article a law would be void even it it merely abridge a fundamental right guaranteed by Part III and does not wholly take away that right The argument that a law or regulation could not be deemed to be unreasonable unless it was totally destructive of the right of the minority to administer educational institutions was expressly negatived by this <ORG> in the case of Rev was the sole measure or test of reasonableness it also did not decide that a regulation would be deemed unreasonable only if it was totally destructive of the right of the minority to administer educational institution There is however nothing in those observations to indicate that this Court would have upheld those clauses if those clauses had abridged or partially destroyed the right under article and not totally destroyed that right In the light of the above principles it can be stated that a law which interferes with the minorities choice of a governing body or management council would be violative of the right guaranteed by article This view has been consistently taken by this Court in the cases of Rt Bishop <NAME> this Court declared invalid the order passed by the educational authorities requiring the Secretary of <ORG> to take steps to constitute a managing committee in accordance with the order of the educational authorities it is of course permissible for the <ORG> and its educational authorities to prescribe the qualifications of teachers but once the teachers possessing the requisite qualifications are selected by the minorities for their educational institutions the <ORG> would have no right to veto the selection of those teachers Clause a of sub sections and of section A of the impugned Act which make provision for giving a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against a penalty to be proposed on a member of the staff of an educational institution would consequently be held to be valid Clause of those sub sections which gives a power to the Vice Chancellor and officer of the <ORG> authorised by him to veto the action of the managing body of an educational institution in awarding punishment to a member of the staff in my opinion interferes with the disciplinary control of the managing body over its teachers It is significant that the power of approval conferred by clause in each of the two sub sections of section A on the Vice Chancellor or other officer authorised by him is a blanket power The conferment of such blanket power on the Vice Chancellor or other officer authorised by him for vetoing the disciplinary action of the managing body of an educational institution makes a serious inroad on the right of the managing body to administer an educational institution it may also be stated that there is nothing objectionable to selecting the method of arbitration for settling major disputes connected with conditions of service of staff of educational institutions This must cause an inroad in the right of the governing body to administer the institution The effect of sections and is that in case the <ORG> so determines and the State Government issues the necessary notification under subsection of section all instructions teaching and training in under graduate courses shall within the <ORG> area be conducted by the <ORG> and shall be imparted by the teachers of the <ORG> A provision which makes it imperative that teaching in under graduate courses can be conducted only by the <ORG> and can be imparted only by the teachers of the <ORG> plainly violates the rights of minorities to establish and administer their educational institutions Such a provision must consequently be held qua minority institutions to result in contravention of article It has been argued on behalf of the respondents that in the case of Re Kerala Education Bill supra this <ORG> upheld clauses and It is the law declared by this <ORG> in the subsequent contested cases which would have a binding effect the view expressed by this <ORG> in Re Kerala Education Bill in this respect was hesitant and tentative and not a final view in the matter referred to an observation made in the case of Attorney General for Ontaric Attorney General for Canada that the advisory opinion of the <ORG> would have no more effect than the opinion of the law officers I need not dilate upon this aspect of the matter because I am of the opinion that the view expressed by this <ORG> in subsequent cases referred to above by applying the general principles laid down in the Re Kerala Education Bill is correct and calls for no interference There was no reference to the conversion of affiliated colleges into constituent colleges in any of these three reports No observation was also made in any of the reports that the provisions of article and the construction placed upon that had in any way stood in the way of raising the standards of education or improving the excellence of educational institutions The process of extension can thus totally annihilate the right guaranteed by article It has also been argued on behalf of the respondents that we should not strike down the impugned sections but should wait till statutes or ordinances are made in pursuance of those sections In this respect I am of the view that since the impugned sections confer the power to frame statutes or regulations violative of the fundamental right under article the very provisions of the Act conferring such power are void so far as minority institutions are concerned No rules or statutes or ordinances framed under the provisions of the Act can take away the constitutional infirmity of those provisions Similar view was expressed in the case of Re Kerala Education Bill supra wherein <NAME> CJ Reference has also been made on behalf of the respondents to the provision of Chapter VIA containing sections to which has been inserted by the amending Act These provisions relate to autonomous colleges autonomous institutions and autonomous <ORG> departments According to section the <ORG> authorities may allow an affiliated college a <ORG> college a recognized institution or a <ORG> department to enjoy autonomy in the matter of admissions of students prescribing the courses of studies imparting instructions and training holding of examinations and the powers to make necessary rules for the purpose in case the <ORG> authorities are satisfied that the standard of education in such college institution or department is so developed that it would be in the interest of education to allow the college institution or department to enjoy autonomy <NAME> <NAME> on behalf of himself and <NAME> <NAME> We agree respectfully with the conclusions of the learned Chief Justice but we propose to state our reasons separately The first question that arises for consideration in writ petition No is whether article of the Constitution confers on the religious and linguistic minorities only the right to establish and administer educational institutions for conserving their language script or culture or whether the scope of the guarantee under that article is wide enough to enable them to establish and administer any other educational institutions of their choice Article reads All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice They say that when article talks of the right of religious or linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice that can only mean educational institutions for conserving their language script or culture or at the most educational institutions for imparting general secular education in order to conserve their language script or culture and not institutions for imparting general secular education divorced from the above purposes In In re The Kerala Education Bill <NAME> speaking for the majority of to said in a Presidential reference under article that the key to the understanding of the true meaning and implication of article is the words of their own choice in the article and that the article leaves it to the choice of those minorities to establish such educational institutions as will serve both purposes namely the purpose of conserving their religion language or culture and the purpose of giving a thorough good general education to their children The learned Chief Justice speaking for the <ORG> said that the width of article cannot be cut down by introducing in it considerations on which article is based that whereas the latter article is a general protection which is given to minorities to conserve their language script or culture the former is a special right to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice and that this choice is not limited to institutions seeking to conserve language script or culture Father <NAME> case and held that articles and confer separate rights though in a given case these rights may overlap <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> observed that article is wider than article in that while any section of the citizens including the minorities can invoke the rights guaranteed under article the right guaranteed under article is only available to the minorities based on religion or language He then went on to say that a reading of these two articles together would lead to the conclusion that a religious or linguistic minority has the right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice for effectively conserving its distinctive language script or culture which right however is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and facilitating the excellence of its standards and that while this is so these two articles are not inter linked nor do they permit of their being always read together Article confers on any section of citizens resident in the territory of India the right to conserve its language script or culture Whereas article confers the right not only upon a minority as understood in its technical sense but also upon a section of the citizens resident in the territory of India which may not be a minority in its technical sense the beneficiary of the right under article is a minority either religious or linguistic language script or culture article deals only with the right to establish and administer educational institutions But under article the right conferred on the religious or linguistic minority is not only the right to establish an educational institution for Supp When a linguistic minority establishes an educational institution to conserve its language the linguistic minority can invoke the protection of both the articles If a linguistic minority can establish only an educational institution to conserve its language then the expression of their choice in article is practically robbed of its meaning For these religious minorities article guarantees no right Yet article gives them the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice That article does not say that only religious minorities having a distinct language script or culture can establish educational institutions of their choice Therefore it is clear that the right guaranteed to a religious or linguistic minority under article is the right to establish any educational institution of its choice The question whether such educational institutions can include a military academy or a police training school need not be considered in the context of the facts of this writ petition for here we are only concerned with an institution imparting general secular education as ordi narily understood The learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the State of Gujarat submitted that although religious and linguistic minorities have the fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice they have no right fundamental or otherwise to get recognition or affiliation as the case may be for the educational institutions established by them unless they submit to the regulations made by the appropriate authority and applicable alike to educational institutions established and administered by the majority as well as to those established and administered by religious and linguistic minorities The argument was that article does not confer any right to recognition or affiliation that recognition or affiliation is a privilege which might be granted or withheld as the legislature might think fit He said that the right to establish educational institutions of their choice means the right to establish real institutions which will effectively serve the needs of their com See the observations of Justice <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> munity and the scholars who resort to their educational institutions and that though there is no such thing as a fundamental right to recognition by the <ORG> yet to deny recognition to the educational institutions except upon terms tantamount to the surrender of their constitutional right of administration of the educational institutions of their choice is in truth and in effect to deprive them of their rights under article see In re The Kerala Education Bill supra The reason why the Constitution makers were at pains to grant religious minorities the fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice is to give the parents in those communities an opportunity to educate their children in institutions having an atmosphere which is congenial to their religion Article implies that a religious minority administering an educational institution imparting general secular education has the liberty to provide for religious education in the institution We have grave doubts whether the expression secular state as it denotes a definite pattern of church and state relationship can with propriety be applied to India There are provisions in the Constitution which make me hesitate to characterize our state as secular The fundamental right of the religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice is the only legal barrier to confine the bursting expansionism of the new Educational Leviathan And juridical equality postulates that the religious minority should have a guaranteed right to establish and administer its own educational institutions where it can imp art secular education in a religious atmosphere Over the years this <ORG> has held that without recognition or affiliation there can be no real or meaningful exercise of the right to establish and administer educational institutions under Article see In re The Kerala Education Bill at Rev Let us now examine the validity of the argument that as there is no right fundamental or otherwise to recognition or affiliation the government may withhold recognition or affiliation for any reason or impose any condition for the same and consequently it may withhold or revoke it even though the reason for doing so may be the minority refusal to surrender its constitutional rights to administer the institution This argument is phrased in syllogistic terms Article does not confer a fundamental right upon a religious or linguistic minority to obtain recognition or affiliation <ORG> has no duty or obligation to set up or establish a university with facilities for affiliation of educational institutions let alone those established and administered by the religious or linguistic minorities in fact there are many universities which are only teaching universities and which do not provide for any facility for affiliation if the legislature is competent to establish universities without providing any facility for affiliation or recognition and thereby withhold affiliation it may grant it in a limited form since the greater power of withholding absolutely must necessarily include the lesser power of granting it with restrictions and conditions and therefore the legislature has power to impose conditions on affiliated colleges established and administered by the religious or linguistic minorities which result in their becoming constituent colleges And as a corollary to this argument it is submitted that the recipient of the benefit or facility namely the The story begins with the judgment of Justice <NAME> in <NAME> New Bedford where he despatched the petition of a policeman who had been discharged from his service for violating a regulation which restricted his political activities by saying that the petitioner may have a constitutional right to talk politics but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman The servant cannot complain as he takes the employment on terms which are offered to him The notion that the petitioner has no constitutional right to be a policeman although he has a constitutional right to talk politics is a specific application of the larger view that no one has a constitutional right to government largess or privilege and is much the same as the argument here that a religious or linguistic minority administering as educational institution has no right to recognition or affiliation though it has a fundamental right to establish or administer it The right to absolutely exclude all right to use necessarily includes the authority to determine under what circumstances such use may be availed of as the greater power contains the lesser at While the term unconstitutional condition was not specifically employed in the opinion the case seems clearly to be the fountainhead of the doctrine which now goes by that name This doctrine takes for granted that the petitioner has no right to be a policeman but it emphasizes the right he is conceded to possess by reason of an explicit provision of the Constitution namely his right to talk politics This is much the same as what <NAME> said inIn re The Kerala Education Bill No educational institutions can in actual practice be carried on without aid from the State and if they will not get it unless they surrender their rights they will by com pulsion of financial necessities be compelled to give up their rights under Article The Additional Solicitor General argued that the <ORG> is not denying equality before the law because the burden of the condition Supp applies to all recipients namely all who establish and administer educational institutions imparting secular education and seek recognition or affiliation whether they be religious or linguistic minorities or not We are of the opinion that in fact everyone is not being offered the same package since the condition serves as a significant restriction on the activities only of those who have the fundamental right of the nature guaranteed by article namely the religious and linguistic minorities and who desire to exercise the right required to be waived as a condition to the receipt of the privilege It is contradictory to speak of a constitutional right and yet to discriminate against a person who exercises that right To avoid invalidation of a condition on any of these grounds it would seem necessary to show that the granting of the benefit or privilege places the recipient in a position which gives the <ORG> or the university a legitimate interest in regulating his rights It appears that there are two legitimate interests which may justify such regulation An examination of the traditional bases of the power to impose conditions upon governmental benefits or privileges would reveal that the power to impose conditions is not a lesser part of the greater power to withhold but instead is a distinct exercise of power which must find its own justification and that the power to withhold recognition or affiliation altogether does not carry with it unlimited power to impose conditions which have the effect of restraining the exercise of fundamental rights The normal desire to enjoy privileges like affiliation or recognition without which the educational institutions established by the minority for imparting secular education will not effec tively serve the purpose for which they were established cannot be made an instrument of suppression of the right guaranteed It cannot be said that by these general laws the <ORG> in any way takes away or abridges the right guaranteed under article Measure which are directed other forms of activities but which have a secondary or indirect or incidental effect upon the right do not generally abridge a right unless the content of the right is regulated But where the burden is the same as that borne by others engaged in different forms of activity the similar impact on the right seems clearly insufficient to constitute an abridgement if an educational institution established by a religious minority seeks no recognition affiliation or aid the state may have no right to prescribe the curriculum syllabi or the qualification of the teachers It sounds paradoxical that a right which the Constitution makers wanted to be absolute can be subjected to regulations which need only satisfy the nebulous and elastic test of state necessity If besides recognition or affiliation an educational institution conducted by a religious minority is granted aid further regulations for ensuring that the aid is utilized for the purpose for which it is granted will be permissible teed by article the right guaranteed under article is not subject to reasonable restrictions and that the right is intended to be errective and is not to be whittled down by so called regulative measures conceived in the interest not of the minority educational institution but of the public or the nation as a whole It was the view of the <ORG> that regulations which may lawfully be imposed either by legislature or executive action as a condition of receiving grant or of recognition must be directed to making the institution while retaining its character as a minority institution effective as an educational institution and that suck regulation must satisfy a dual tes the test of reasonableness namely the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it The <ORG> said further that the right of the state to regulate education educational standards and allied matters cannot be denied since the minority institutions cannot be allowed to fall below the standards or under the guise of exclusive right of management to decline to follow the general pattern and that while the management must be left to them they may be compelled to keep in step with others What the <ORG> said in answer to the contention of Mr <NAME> that the provisions in the Kerala University Act which were struck down were conceived in the interest of general education is instructive in this context Mr <NAME> brought to our notice passages from the Report of the Education <ORG> in which the <ORG> bad made suggestions regarding the conditions of service of the teaching staff in the universities and the colleges and standards of teaching We have no doubt that the provisions of the Act were made bona fide and in the interest of education but unfortunately they do affect the administration of these institutions and rob the founders of that right which the Constitution desires should We think that the provisions of sub sections and of A abridge the right of the religious minority to administer educational institutions of their choice The requirement that the college should have a governing body which shall include persons other than those who are members of the governing body of <ORG> would take away the management of the college from the governing body constituted by <ORG> and vast it in a different body The right to administer the educational institution established by a religious minority is vested in it It is in the governing body of <ORG> that he religious minority which established the college has vested the right to administer the institution and that body alone has the right to administer the same The question is whether the provision has the effect of divesting the governing body as constituted by the religious minority of its exclusive right to administer the institution Under the guise of preventing maladministration the right of the governing body of the college constituted by the religious minority to administer the institution cannot be taken away The effect of the provision is that the religious minority virtually loses its right to administer the institution it has founded Sections and of the Kerala University Act which came up for consideration in that case respectively dealt with the governing body for private colleges not under corporate management and the managing council for private colleges under corporate management It was held that the sections had the effect of abridging the right to administer the educational institution of the religious minority in question there The right to choose the principal and to have the teaching conducted by teachers appointed by the management after an overall assessment of their outlook and philosophy is perhaps the most important facet of the right to administer an educational institution That is part of the fundamental right of the minorities to administer the educational institution established by them Sub section of says that on receipt of the communication under subsection the Government may after making such inquiry as it thinks fit by notification in the Official Gazette declare that the provisions of shall come into force on such date as may be specified The fundamental right of a minority to administer educational institutions of its choice comprises within it the elementary right to conduct teaching training and instruction in courses of studies in the institutions so established by teachers appointed by the minority If this essential component of the right of administration is taken away from the minority and vested in the university there can be no doubt that its right to administer the educational institution guaranteed under article is taken away The word conduct occurring in cannot have a meaning different from what it has in If in it means that the university is the exclusive teaching and training agency in post graduate instruction there is no reason to think that any vestige of the right to teach trait or instruct will be left to the minority after these matters are taken over by the university If this section is ultra vires article we do not think that which in the present scheme of legislation is dependent upon can survive and therefore it is unnecessary to express any view upon the constitutionality of its provisions Sub sections and of A read A No member of the teaching other academic and non teaching staff of an affiliated college and recognized or approved institution shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an enquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity or being heard in respect of those charges and until a he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making representation on any such penality proposed to be inflicted on him and the penalty to be inflicted on him is approved by the Vice Chancellor or any other officer of the university authorised by the Vice Chancellor in this behalf No termination of Service of such member not amounting to his dismissal or removal falling under sub section shall be valid unless a he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing caus against the proposed termination and such termination is approved by the Vice Chancellor or any officer of the University authorised by the Vice Chancellor in this behalf Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to any person who is appointed for a temporary period only It was argued for the petitioners that clause of A has the effect of vesting in the Vice Chancellor a general power of veto on the right of the management to dismiss a teacher of course it is open to the State in the exercise of its regulatory power to require that before the services of a teacher are terminated he should be given an opportunity of being heard in his defence But to require that for terminating the services of a teacher after an inquiry has been conducted the management should have the approval of an outside agency like the Vice Chancellor or of his nominee would be an abridgement of its right to administer the educational institution The fact that the power on be delegated by the ViceChancellor to any officer of the university means that any petty officer to whom the power is delegated can exercise a general power of veto There is no obligation under the sub sections and that the Vice Chancellor or his nominee should give any reason for disapproval As we said a blanket power without any guideline to disapprove the action of the management would certainly encroach upon the right of the management to dismiss or terminate the services of a teacher after an enquiry In the result we hold that the provisions of A subclauses and of A and A are violative of article of the Constitution and therefore they can have no application to educational institutions established and administered by religious or linguistic minorities <NAME> The two questions to be answered by us are Whether the impact of Article of the Constitution upon any of the provisions of the Act before us or to put it conversely whether the effect of any of the provisions of the Act upon the fundamental rights guaranteed to minorities by Art is such as to invalidate these provisions Whether the rights guaranteed by Article are in any way circumscribed by Article On the second question I have nothing significant to add to what has fallen from My Lord the Chief Justice In other words it has a right to impart a general secular education But can it be compelled to give it a treatment different from that given to other <ORG>s making such a choice Turning to the first and the more complex question I think it is difficult to answer the argument of the Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the State of Gujarat that where a minority <ORG> has of its own free will opted for affiliation under the terms of a statute it must be deemed to have chosen to give up as a price for the benefits resulting from affiliation the exercise of certain rights which may in another context appear to be unwarranted impairments of its fundamental rights It is true that if the object of an enactment is to compel a minority <ORG> even indirectly to give up the exercise of its fundamental rights the provisions which have this effect will be void or inoperative against the minority <ORG> The price of affiliation cannot be a total abandonment of the right to establish and administer a minority <ORG> conferred by Art I shall endeavour to show that the view which this <ORG> has taken whenever questions of this kind have arisen before it on the effect of the provisions of a statute though theoretically and logically perhaps not quite consistent always on propositions accepted has the virtue of leaving the result to the balancing of conflicting considerations to be carried out on the particular provisions and facts involved in each case When we examine either the Act as a whole or the impugned provisions of the Act before us we find no mention whatsoever of anything which is directed against a minority or its educational Institutions If we accept the argument that When the minority Institution exercised its choice by applying for affiliation under the provisions of the Act there were no amendments before it The first provision which has a compulsive effect on <ORG> is Sec The petitioner has not however in the reliefs prayed for by the petition asked for a declaration that Section is invalid Inasmuch as Section of the Act has a compulsive effect by denying to the petitioning college the option to keep out of the statute altogether it would in my opinion be in operative against it This provision would have the compelling effect of making it automatically a constituent unit of the <ORG> and must therefore be held to be inoperative against the petitioning <ORG> as it cannot affect the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art of the Act the statute read as a whole places before the Petitioning college the following four alternatives To become a constituent unit of the University To continue as an affiliated college on new terms embodied in amended provisions contained in Sections A A and A of the Act If the petitioning <ORG> which has applied for the status of an autonomous <ORG> under Section of the Act as amended in is provided with an avenue of escape by the amended provisions themselves it seems quite unnecessary to consider the impact of Sec The only provision which could have a compulsive effect in their present form against the petitioning <ORG> could be sec Therefore it seems unnecessary in the case before us to consider the impact of provisions other than sections and of the Act upon the rights of the petitioning college at present may be expressed there is a power in the <ORG> to regulate their exercise Provision for and regulation by the <ORG> of the very conditions which secure to minority institutions the freedom to establish and administer its educational institutions is obviously inevitable and undeniable In other words existence of some power to lay down necessary conditions or prerequisites for maintaining the right to establish and administer an institution itself in a sound state is inherent in the very existence of organised society which the <ORG> represents Laws made for sustaining the very conditions of organised society and civilised existence so that the rights of all including fundamental rights of the minorities may be maintained and enforced do not rest on mere implication But it was submitted on behalf of the <ORG> that it is only a law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution containing the fundamental rights of citizens which is void and that too only to the extent of the contravention of the Constitution we have to look at the total effect of statutory provisions and not merely intention behind them In a case in which the pattern is accepted voluntarily by a minority institution with a view to taking advantage of the benefits conferred by a statute it seems to me that it cannot insist upon an absolutely free exercise of the right of administration It appears to me that Sec of the Act which deals with the powers of <ORG> of <ORG> does not directly or indirectly touch a minority institution rights under Art of the Constitution merely because <ORG> may take decisions which may have that effect of the Act could be determined because the section itself gives a general power not specifically directed against minority institutions A of the Act on the ground that it violates any fundamental right other than the it seems to me that provisions of Sec The majority of the learned Judges held at The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to maladminister The minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings without any competent teachers possessing any semblance of qualification and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars It stands to reason then that the constitutional right toadminister an educational institution of their choice does notnecessarily militate against the claim of the <ORG> to insist that in order to grant aid the <ORG> may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to be aided But there is little room for differences of opinion when it is asserted that the spirit which the <ORG> is bound to foster is that of pursuit and worship of the ideals set out in the preamble to our Constitution It does not declare anything more to be unconstitutional and invalid than that which has a compelling effect so as to practically leave no choice open before a minority institution except to submit to statutory regulations as the price to be paid for its existence at all as an educational institution of the Act before us which offers the right to the petitioning college to become quite independent and free from the administrative control of the <ORG> beyond a general supervision of the constitution it does not appear to me to be helpful in resolving the difficulties of the case before us Administration was equated with management of affairs of the institution and it was observed at page This management must be free of control so that the founders or their nominees an mould the institution as they think fit and in accordance with their ideas of how the inte rests of the community in general and the institution in particular will be best served Immediately after that however followed a paragraph which with great respect I find some difficulty in completely reconciling with any absolute freedom of the management of the institution from control There is however an exception to this and it is that the standards of education are not a part of management as such Therefore if universities establish syllabi for examinations they must be followed subject however to special subjects which the institutions may seek to teach and to a certain extent the <ORG> may also regulate the conditions of employment of teachers and the health and hygiene of students Yet the right of the <ORG> to regulate education educational standards and allied matters cannot be denied of the Act provides the petitioning <ORG> before us with a practically certain mode of escape from the compulsiveness of provisions other than Sections and of the Act if claims made on its behalf are correct this Court considered the effect of a notification of <ORG> It was held there at Clause however in our view does not suffer from the same vice as clause because that provision in so far as it is applicable to the minority institutions empowers the <ORG> to prescribe by regulations governing the service and conduct of teachers which is enacted in the larger interests of the institutions to ensure their efficiency and excellence Of course while the power to make ordinances in respect of the matters referred to is unexceptional the nature of the infringement of the right if any under Article will depend on the actual purpose and import of the ordinance when made and the manner in which it is likely to affect the administration of the educational institution about which it is not possible now to predicate It was urged on behalf of the petitioning college that if it could get the advantages of affiliation or recognition by the <ORG> only under the terms of an enactment which requires it to adhere to a pattern or scheme under which substantial powers relating to management of the institution have to be surrendered it really amounts to compelling it to abandon the exercise of its fundamental right of management guaranteed by Art It is submitted that the situation which emerges is that there is practically speaking no alternative left before the college other than compliance with the terms of affiliation or recognition without which its students could not get degrees of the Constitution enables a mino rity to contend that in order to secure an equal protection of laws the <ORG> should make some statutory provision so that minority institutions may obtain recognition or teach for degrees recognised by the <ORG> without sacrificing any part of it rights of management guaranteed by Art No claim for an order directing the <ORG> to make such alternative provision for the petitioning minority institution is made before us If we were to hold that affiliation is open to a minority institution on some other terms not found in the statutory provisions at all it would it seems to me really amount to nothing short of legislation which is really not our function Moreover in the case before us on the claims put forward on behalf of the petitioning college it appears very likely that the college will get the benefit of section of the Act and therefore will escape from the consequences of affiliation found in the impugned sections It is true that section of the Act imposes certain conditions which if the claims made on behalf of the petitioning college are correct the college will have no difficulty in satisfying For this reason also it appears to me to be unnecessary at least at this stage to make a declaration about the effect of sections and A and A and A upon the fundamental rights of the petitioner protected by Art Section to which I attach considerable importance for the purposes of this case reads as follows Any affiliated college or University college or a recognised institution or <ORG> may by a letter addressed to the Registrar apply to <ORG> to allow the college institution or as the case may be <ORG> to enjoy autonomy in the matters of admission of students prescribing the courses of studies imparting instructions and training holding of examinations and the powers to make necessary rules for the purpose hereinafter referred to as the specified matters Either on receipt of a letter or application under sub section or where it appears to <ORG> that the standards of education in any affiliated college or University college or recognised institution or University <ORG> are so developed that it would be in the interest of education to allow the college institution or <ORG> to enjoy autonomy in the specified matters on its own motion <ORG> shall a for the purpose of satisfying itself whether the standards of education in such college institution or <ORG> are so developed that it would be in the interest of education to allow the college institution or <ORG> to enjoy autonomy in the specified matters i direct a local inquiry to be made by a competent person or persons authorised by <ORG> in this behalf and ii make such further inquiry as may appear to it to be necessary after consulting <ORG> on the question whether the college institution or <ORG> should be allowed to enjoy autonomy in the specified matters and statingthe result of the inquiry under clause a record its opinions that question and make a report to the Court on that question embodying in such report the result of the inquiries the opinion of <ORG> and the opinion recorded by it Where <ORG> sanctions the proposals it shall by an order published in <ORG> confer on the college institution or <ORG> specified in the proposals power to regulate the admission of students to the college institution or as the case may be the <ORG> prescribing the course of studies in the college institution or <ORG> the imparting if instructions teaching and training in the course of studies the holding of examinations and powers to make the necessary rules for the purpose after consulting <ORG> and such other powers as may have been specified in the proposals Is it possible for us to gauge the total effect without taking all these factors into con sideration I venture to think with great respect that we cannot determine the effect of each provision in the abstract or in isolation from other provisions and the facts relating to the particular petitioning college put forward before us On the situation under consideration before us the minority institution affected by the enactment has upon the claims put forward on its behalf also a means of escape from the impugned provisions other than sections and of the Act by resorting to Sec <NAME> <NAME> Since I partly agree and partly degree with the plurality opiniotis it has become necessary for me to write a separate judgment It is true that an educational institution may also impart religious instruction and may thus serve as a means to the exercise of religious freedom But Art elevates the right of establishing and administering an educational institution to the plane of an independent right It has nothing to do with the majority community extends the right of establishing and administering an educational institution not only to a religious minority but also to a linguistic minority who may be even atheists Such a minority may establish and administer institutions for imparting secular general education The right to establish and administer educational institutions for imparting secular general education cannot be disentangled from the whole plexus of rights under Art Article on the other hand guarantees the right of a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions Article gives security to an interest Article gives security to an activity may establish an educational institution which may have no concern with the object of conserving its script language and culture Article does not in express or implied terms limit the right of the minorities to establish an educational institution of a particular type The right to establish an educational institution impliedly grants two kinds of choices The minorities have a right to establish or not to establish any particular type of educational institution The right to form associations and unions under Art So it seems to me that the words of their choice merely make patent what is latent in Art The Court has already held that the right to establish an educational institution under Art They have also taken special care to extend a guarantee to a minority educational institution against discrimination in the matter of aid from the <ORG> on the ground that it is under management of a minority based on religion or language Again as our <ORG> is secular in character affiliation of an institution imparting religious instruction or teaching only theology of a particular reli gious minority may not comport with the secular character of the <ORG> does not grant the right of affiliation to such an institution it cannot confer that right on an institution imparting It is urged that as freedom of circulation is held to be implied in freedom of speech and expression so the right of affiliation should be implied in the right to establish educational institutions There is a distinction between freedom of thought and freedom of speech and expression But the right of affiliation is not necessarily implied in that sense in the right of establishing educational institutions In pro independent India there were a number of unaffiliated and unrecognised educational institutions of good repute The <ORG> may at any time abandon this facile and mechanical suitability test and may make selections by competitive examinations open to all whether possessing or not possessing a recognised degree or diplomas However in case of an affiliating University affiliation cannot be denied to a minority institution on the sole ground that it is managed by a minority whether based on religion or language or on arbitrary or irrational basis gives a right to the majority community to establish and administer educational institutions subject to reasonable restrictions in the public interest Art should be construed to confer a higher right on the minority than the one conferred on the majority by Art The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India has been greatly qualified by the recognition of the <ORG> regulating power to make laws operating differently on different classes of persons in the governance of its subjects with the result that the principle of equality of Article confers a right by enacting a prohibition which in form at least is absolute but Art Article as interpreted by the courts would run in some such words as these The <ORG> shall not deny to any person equality be fore the law or equal protection of the law provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the <ORG> from making a law based on or involving a classification founded on an intelligible differentia having a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging freedom of speech or of the Press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for the redress of grievances In incorporating these principles into the fundamental law there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions which continued to be recognised as if they had been formally expressed This survey should be sufficient to explode the argument of absolute or near absolute right to establish and administer an educational institution by a religious or linguistic minority from the absolute words of Art and of the Constitution <NAME> said If however two constructions are possible then the court must adopt that which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or No religious or linguistic minority establishing and administering an educational institution which receives aid from the <ORG> funds shall deny admission to any citizen to the institution on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The right to admita student to an educational institution is admittedly comprised in the right to administer it Article enables the <ORG> to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes in the matter of admission in the educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid from the <ORG> Article imposes a third restriction on the right in Art prohibits a religious minority establishing and administering an educational institution which receives aid or is recognised by the <ORG> from compelling any citizen reading in the institution to receive religious instruction against his wishes or if minor against the wishes of his guardian It cannot be disputed that the right of a religious minority to impart religious instruction in an educational institution forms part of the right to administer the institution There are also certain implied limitations on this right The system implies order and harmony among the various rights constituting our Liberty according to the necessities of each case For instance a citizen cannot exercise his right of freedom of speech and expression on another man property without his leave for such exercise of right would violate the latter right to hold property conferred on him under Art which protects a law throwing open Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes of Hindus this <ORG> upheld the validity of a law throwing open public temples to excluded class of Hindus Speaking for the <ORG> <NAME> said The result then is that there are two provisions of equal authority neither of them being subject to the other The rule of construction is well settled that when there are in an enactment two provisions which cannot be reconciled with each other they should be so interpreted that if possible effect could be given to both then full effect can be given to art will be put wholly out of operation in the latter effect can be given to both that provision and Art How could they then intend to confer an absolute or near absolute right on a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer an educational institution for imparting secular general education It is well to remember that it is the Constitution which we are expounding There may be some others which may receive both aid and recognition some others may receive neither aid nor recognition For instance institutions receiving aid and recognition may be subject to greater regulation than those which receive neither Similarly institutions imparting secular general education may be subject to greater regulation than those which are imparting religious cultural and linguistic instruction solely In other words what is the test for deciding whether a regulation imposed on a minority educational institution takes away or abridges the right conferred by Art While balancing these competing interests the <ORG> should give due weight to the legislative judgment It is conceded by counsel supporting the petitioners that the <ORG> may prescribe the curriculum and syllabus for the minority educational institutions which are aided or recognised by it It appears to me that the <ORG> prescribes the curriculum and syllabus as much from the point of view of excellence of instruction as from the point of view of having a uniform standard of instruction With profound respect to the learned Judges who decided the <ORG> case I find it difficult to accept this argument Nor should the regulatory power be hamstrung by such concepts as real and effective exercise of the right should not be touched by the regulation or that regulation should not directly and immediately impinge on the right conferred by Art Speaking for the majority <NAME> said We are thus faced with a problem of considerable complexity apparently difficult of solution There is on the one hand the minority rights under Art Likewise cl takes away an obvious item of management for the manager cannot appoint any teacher at all except out of the panel to be prep ared by <ORG> which apart from the question of its power of taking up such duties may not be qualified at all to select teachers who will be acceptable to religious denominations and in particular sub cl of that clause is objectionable for it thrusts upon educational institutions of religious minorities teachers of Scheduled Castes who may have no knowledge of the tenants of their religion and may be otherwise weak educationally This passage also shows that the <ORG> has adhered to the view taken by <NAME> in Re Kerala Education Bill supra to the effect that the <ORG> has power to make regulations for protecting certain social interests The decision in this case does not seem to me to be in conflict with the construction suggested by me because the <ORG> took the view that the right of <ORG> to admit students of their own choice was severely restricted by the <ORG> order Take for instance the right of any citizen including a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer a military academy for imparting theoretical as well as practical training to the students admitted to it However <NAME> speaking for the unanimous <ORG> observed In our view there is no possible justification for the provisions contained in clause of Chapter of the statutes which decidedly interfere with the ri ghts of management of <ORG> All these decisions follow one or the other decisions of this Court as they should have done In particular they shall have an equal right to maintain manage and control at their own expense or to establish in the future charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establish Supp Section provides that on receipt of the communication the <ORG> Government may after making such inquiry as it thinks fit by notification in the Official Gazette declare that the provisions of shall come into force on such date as may be specified in the notifi It has already been held earlier that the right of affiliation is not a fundamental right guaranteed by Art Accordingly I see no difficulty in the <ORG> take over of the teaching in under graduate classes Section consists of five sub sections It is the degree of external control exercised over the administration of a minority college and not its statutory name that is relevant for the purposes of Art Serious objection on behalf of the petitioner has however been taken to clauses ii to vi of sub section Sub section provides that the services of no member of the teaching and non teaching staff shall be terminated unless he had been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed termination It is clarified that this provision shall not apply to a person who is appointed for a temporary period this power is also made subject to the approval of the Vice chancellor or any other officer of the <ORG> authorised by the Vice chancellor But this right cannot include the right to take away or abridge the employee constitutional right to form associations to carry on his profession and other constitutional and legal rights It seems to me that the power of approval by the Vice Chancellor is necessary in the interest of the security of service of the teaching and non teaching staff
