No such principles however were published in the <ORG> or laid before the two Houses of Parliament though certain principles governing the issue of permits by the Controller were specified in a communication addressed by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India dated April to the Chief Industrial Adviser by virtue of which the Controller could issue permits only to certain manufactures and not to any dealer On April the petitioners applied for permits to enable them to take delivery of the copper in respect of which they had entered into contracts but the applications were refused Thereupon the petitioners filed a petition under Art of the Constitution of India challenging the validity of the order refusing the grant of the permit and contended inter alia that the fixation of the price under cl of the Non ferrous Metal Control Order which had the effect of driving the dealer out of business in imported copper and likewise cl of the said Order read with the communication dated April which had the effect of completely eliminating the dealers from the trade in imported copper contravened Arts and of the Constitution and that such total elimination of the dealer amounting as it will to prohibition of any exercise of the right to carry on trade or to acquire property was not a mere restriction on the rights and was outside the saving provision of cls and of the Constitution includes cases of prohibition also that where a restriction reaches the stage of total restraint of rights special care has to be taken by the Court to see that the test of reasonableness is satisfied by considering the question in the background of the facts and circumstances under which the order was made taking into account the nature of the evil that was sought to be remedied by such law the ratio of the harm caused to individual citizens by the proposed remedy the beneficial effect reasonably expected to result to the general public and whether the restraint caused by the law was more than was necessary in the interests of the general public The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> three persons who have filed this petition under Art On different dates prior to April they entered into contracts of purchase of copper with importers at Bombay and Calcutta The price was controlled by cl of the Order which provides in its first sub clause that no person shall sell or offer to sell any non ferrous metal at a price which exceeds the amount represented by an addition of to its landed cost and in its second sub clause that no person shall purchase or offer to purchase from any person non ferrous metal at a price higher than at which it is permissible for that other person to sell to him under sub cl Clauses and of the Order made it obligatory on the importers to notify quantities of non ferrous metal imported and to maintain certain books of account while the last clause i cl confers powers on the Controller to enter and search any premises in order to inspect any book or document and to seize any non ferrous metal in certain circumstances The relevant portion of this com munication is in these words The following principles shall govern the issue of permits by the Controller In respect of the scheduled industries under the Control of <ORG> the Controller will determine the monthly requirements of actual users based on their production in the year In the case of small scale industries the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports on the certificate of the State Directors of Industries will inform the Controller of the quantities that the units would be entitled to and thereupon the Controller will make such quantities available to these units from time to time Tile Controller shall normally release one month requirements at a time to the consuming units and the permit shall be valid for a period of two months but if heavy imports are reported the Controller shall have the discretion to issue stocks in larger quantities In view of the requirement of cl of the Order the petitioners applied on April for permits to enable them to take delivery of the copper in respect of which they had entered into contracts with different parties First it is said that cl of the Order read with the principles specified in the letter of the th April violates the right conferred on them as citizens of India by Art of the Constitution of India to acquire pro perty and also the right conferred by Article to carry on trade that these violations are not within the saving provisions of Art Secondly it is said that the fixation of the price at the landed cost plus as the maximum also abridge the rights conferred on them by Arts The petitioners pray for an appropriate writ or order or direction restraining the respondents <ORG> the Chief Industrial Adviser to <ORG> and the Development Officer <ORG> from enforcing cls and of the order to quashing the order of the Development Officer rejecting the petitioners application for grant of permit by a direction to the nd and rd respondents to grant the applications for permits and restraining them from granting permits to others than the petitioners in respect of copper covered by their contracts with importers and of the Order and the principles specified are laws which impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of rights conferred by Arts It is urged that once it is found that the <ORG> has power under a valid law to provide for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution of an essential commodity and trade and commerce therein as soon as it is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of the essential commodity or for securing its equitable distribution and availability at fair prices the order made by them can be attacked only if it is outside the power granted by the section or if it is mala fide Malafides have not been suggested and we are proceeding on the assumption that <ORG> was honestly of opinion that it was necessary and expedient to make an order providing for regulation and prohibition of the supply and distribution of imported copper and trade and commerce therein may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce in to include a power to make such provisions even though they may be in contravention of the Constitution Such words have to be read by necessary implication in every provision and every law made by the <ORG> on any day after the Constitution came into force we have first to coNsider the question whether such total elimination is a mere restriction on the rights under Arts On behalf of the petitioners it has been urged that the prohibition of the exercise of a right must be distinguished from restriction on the exercise of a right and when the Constitution speaks of laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of rights it does not save laws which prohibit the exercise of any such right It is urged that the total elimination of the dealer amounting as it will to prohibition of any exercise of the right to carry on trade or to acquire property would therefore be in any case outside the saving provisions of cls At of the Report <NAME> after pointing out that the deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India observed Therefore Art cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty I am unable to accept the contention that the word deprivation includes within its scope restriction when interpreting article qualifies sub clause of clause which should therefore be read in the light of cl The last mentioned clause permits the <ORG> to impose reasonable restrictions on the Imposition of reasonable restrictions clearly implies that the right of free movement is not entirely destroyed but that parts of the right remain Such a prohibition on the face of it is of an arbitrary nature inasmuch as it has no relation whatsoever to the object which the legislation seeks to a law which had the effect of prohibiting the exercise of a right to carry on trade to many citizens to that even in the fields of these rights new laws might be made and old laws would operate where this was necessary for general welfare Laws imposing reasonable restriction on the exercise of the rights are saved by cl in respect of rights under sub cl which is in these words All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall to the extent of such inconsistency be void The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void or taking away the rights conferred by the Article provided this inconsistency or taking away was reasonable in the interests of the different matters mentioned in the clause When however the foreign exchange position of the country deteriorated and it was felt necessary in the larger interests of the country to conserve foreign exchange as much as possible copper was excluded from the Open General List from July and it became necessary to obtain a licence before copper could be imported During the period October to March licences were granted to established importers only Was it necessary however that the prices should be fixed in such a manner as to eliminate the dealer completely as has been done in the instant case The introduction of a system of permits was also clearly necessary in the interests of the general public There is therefore no substance in the contention that the specification of the principles violates Art There is no escape therefore from the conclusion that so long as principles are not specified by <ORG> by an Order notified in accordance with sub and laid before both <ORG> in accordance with sub as it is now Worded is not within the saying provisions of Arts The petitioners are therefore entitled to relief only in respect of cl of the order We direct that an order be issued restraining the respondents from enforcing cl of the Non ferrous Metal Control Order so long as principles in accordance with law are not published in <ORG> and laid before <ORG> in accordance with sub As the petition has succeeded in part and failed in part we order that the parties will bear their own costs
