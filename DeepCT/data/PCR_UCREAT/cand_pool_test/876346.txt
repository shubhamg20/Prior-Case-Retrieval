The petitioner has assailed the notification dated annexure to the writ petition issued under Section read with Section and Section of the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter referred to as an Act Primarily as it would appear from the facts and discussions herein under the petitioner has only attacked the notification issued under Section and of the Act by which the provisions of Section A of the Act have been excluded and the petitioner right to file objections against the proposed acquisition has been taken away The petitioner for developing the said land had submitted a lay out plan to <ORG> hereinafter referred to as <ORG> for approval and when the same was not approved the petitioner approached <ORG> by filing a writ petition wherein vide order dated passed by this Court directions were issued to the <ORG> to consider the lay out plan of the petitioner in accordance with law on merit provided the land is not under acquisition In the meantime the State of on issued the impugned notification under Section read with Section of the Act proposing to acquire Hectare of land of the villages Barauli Ahir Bagda Tora Lakawali Chamrauli Mayapur and Kala Kheria in Agra including the land in dispute In the aforesaid notification it has been clearly stated that the land is needed for the public purpose of plan development of a residential colony The petitioner further states that the development authority is already possessed of over bighas of land which was acquired by it for Taj Nagari phase II and this acquired land has not been developed by it therefore there is no need for acquiring any further land It has also been stated in the petition that the respondents have left out or released some plots of land from the acquisition on account of political influence or pressure and as such the action of the respondents in acquiring the land of the petitioner is arbitrary and discriminatory in nature The petitioner contends that the valuable right of the petitioner to file objections under Section A of the Act against the proposed acquisition cannot be taken away as the respondents have not applied mind as to whether there was any urgency of such a nature so as to exclude the petitioner rights under Section A of the Act The plea of urgency is belied from the fact that despite the impugned notification having been issued on even then the respondents have not cared to issue the final declaration under Section of the Act till date At the time of filing of writ petition a preliminary objection was raised on behalf of <ORG> that the petition is premature and is not maintainable The petitioner has no cause of action to challenge the notification issued under Section of the Act independently However despite the above preliminary objection the writ petition was duly entertained and an interim order was passed on directing the parties to maintain status quo for a limited period which order is continuing In the meantime many other writ petitions challenging the impugned notification on the same footing were entertained and interim orders on the same lines were passed therein by <ORG> Few of the other writ petitions of similar nature challenging the impugned notification came to be dismissed as premature and not maintainable However <ORG> vide order dated dismissed all Special Leave Petitions on the ground that they arise from an interim order passed by <ORG> directing for maintaining status quo <ORG> further while dismissing the Special Leave Petitions hoped that <ORG> shall dispose of the writ petitions pending before it within three months after notice to the respondents However since <ORG> has passed an order for maintenance of status quo we expect <ORG> to dispose of these petitions when they come up after notice and in any case not later than three months from today Some petitions have now been filed challenging both the notifications issued under Section and of the Land Acquisition Act In the present writ petition counter affidavits have been filed separately by the respondent No State of respondents No and Collector and Land Acquisition Officer <ORG> respectively and respondent No A <NAME> learned Counsel for <ORG> has reiterated the preliminary objection that the petitioner has no cause of action for filing the writ petition as in respect of the petitioner land only a notification under Section of the Act has been issued and there is no final declaration under Section of the Act He has relied upon few orders passed by this <ORG> wherein the writ petitions challenging the notification under Section of the Land Acquisition Act were dismissed summarily as premature with liberty to the petitioners to approach the <ORG> as and when occasion arises i after the issuance of declaration under Section of the Act <NAME> learned Counsel for the petitioner in reply to the above preliminary objection and the submissions of <NAME> Advocate has emphasized that the notification issued under Section of the Act can also be challenged independently if there are legal mala fides in issuing the same i it has been issued for non existing purposes or for any oblique motive In short the plea that the writ petition challenging the notification under Section of the Act as premature was not accepted and it was observed that though ordinarily the <ORG> do not interfere at the stage of proposal but where there is a frontal attack to the notification on account of legal infirmities and there are legal mala fides the <ORG> is not powerless in issuing an appropriate writ even at the stage of proposal Similar view has been expressed by <ORG> of Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of <NAME> <ORG> Supra wherein it has been held that where the very initiation of the proceedings are tainted with mala fides the notification under Section of the Act can be challenged on the basis of a colourable exercise of power forthwith In view of the above discussions we are of the view that even though the notification issued under Section of the Act is merely a proposal and is not a conclusive proof of acquisition the <ORG> may exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution of India to quash the same if the notification is per se illegal and the mandatory procedure prescribed has not been followed in issuing and publishing the same and where the proposal is tainted by mala fides Therefore to conclude the writ petition challenging the notification under Section of the Act is some times maintainable at least in the above two exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the <ORG> In the present case it is admitted that there is no legal discrepancy in issuing and publishing the notification under Section of the Act The notification has duly been published in the Official Gazette dated <ORG> Amar Ujala and Dainik Jagran of Agra both dated The substance of the notification has also been published in the locality by beat and drums on as well as by pasting public notices at the convenient places in the locality Thus admittedly there is no frontal attack on the validity of the notification issued under Section of the Act So far as the second aspect of the matter is concerned that the proposal for acquisition is based on the legal mala fides in as much as there is no public purpose to acquire the land we are of the opinion that the notification in unequivocal terms states that the land is needed for the public purpose of plan development of a residential colony The submission that the land is actually being acquired for development by private builders and as such there is no public purpose has no base to stand Therefore the argument that the proposal to acquire the land is tainted with legal mala fides and is a colourable exercise of power is not acceptable to us Sri <NAME> has then asserted that even if the notification issued under Section of the Act is held to be a valid notification the other part of the impugned notification in so far as it invokes the provisions of Section and of the Act dispensing with enquiry under Section A of the Act is bad in law as the statutory right of the petitioner to file objection has been taken away without there being any urgency to acquire the land The scheme of the Act makes it abundantly clear that the notification under Section of the Act is quite distinct separate and independent from the notification issued under Section of the Act Some times the notification under Section of the Act is simultaneously issued and published with the notification under Section of the Act and there is no illegality in doing so This is what has been done in the present case The first part of the notification contains the proposal of the respondents to acquire the land in dispute in public interest for the plan development and the second part of the notification relates to invoking the powers under Section of Act excluding the inquiry contemplated by Section A of the Act Therefore the notification issued under Section of the Act is open to challenge independently even before the issuance of the declaration under Section of the Act where prima facie there is no material before the authorities to record subjective satisfaction about urgency The scheme of Act contemplates the use of emergency powers only in exceptional circumstances provided there is real urgency where the <ORG> cannot even wait for holding enquiry under Section A of the Act though in forming such a opinion elaborate reasons are not required to be given but nevertheless there must be something on record to show that the opinion of the Collector or <ORG> has been formed on the basis of the material on record and is not arbitrary The language of the notification is not conclusive but the Court is required to consider the material whether there is any urgency to exercise the power under Section of the Act The same view taken by this Court in <NAME> case AIR SCW referred to earlier It may also be noted that the existence of the urgency alone is not enough to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act it requires consideration whether the urgency is of a type as to justify the dispensing of the enquiry In other words <ORG> has not only to apply its mind to the urgency of the matter but also that the urgency is of such a nature that even summary proceedings contemplated by Section A of the Act are required to be dispensed with wherein it has been held that The mind of the Officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an enquiry under Section A which has to be considered It provides for issuing the notification under Section of the Act containing the proposal to acquire the land Section A gives a statutory right to the person interested or to the person whose land is proposed to be acquired to file objection disputing the proposal to acquire the land Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the <ORG> to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose A public purpose however laudable it may be by itself is not sufficient to take aid of Section to use this extraordinary power as use of such power deprives a landowner of his right in relation to immovable property to file objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the enquiry under Section A of the Act The authority must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose real urgency that the situation demands and the time factor i whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period within which the objections could be received from the landowners and the inquiry under Section A of the Act could be completed Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose does not arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise unexpectedly exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such as due to earthquake flood or some specific time bound project where the delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous A citizen property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real and genuine urgency it may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due consideration of the acquiring authority While applying the urgency clause the <ORG> should indeed act with due care and responsibility Save in real urgency where public interest does not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not having regard to Articles and burke an enquiry under Section of the Act It has also been laid down that in order to satisfy itself as to whether one or more grounds for judicial review exist the <ORG> may call for record and must satisfy about the existence of the I urgency or there being application of mind by <ORG> on the basis of the material on record The <ORG> vide letter No i ii A dated under the signatures of the Vice Chairman has submitted the proposal to acquire the land in dispute to the Collector Agra for being forwarded to <ORG> The said proposal states that the proposal to acquire the land in dispute has been passed by the Board of <ORG> vide resolution No in its th Meeting held on There is requirement to have a solid land bank for future development There is no whisper about the urgency to acquire the same However in the application form for acquisition of land which forms the part of the above proposal it has only been stated that the possession of the land is immediately required because unauthorized developments are taking place in urgent need of residential and commercial activities The certificate of the Secretary of <ORG> dated which is also the part of the proposal states that the land is needed for promoting the residential colony for which purpose solid land bank is required therefore the land is urgently needed and the provision of Section of the Act should be invoked so as to avoid the delay in holding the inquiry under Section A of the Act The proposal submitted by the <ORG> places no material on record to establish any urgency to acquire the land except stating that the land is urgently needed for consolidating the land bank for future development There is absolutely no material on record to justify that the land is so urgently needed that the Collector State Government cannot even wait for completing the summary enquiry contemplated by Section A of the Act He has placed reliance upon paragraph of the counter affidavit of the <ORG> which states that International Olympic size stadium is to be constructed over acares of proposed acquired land for holding International level sports events in Agra and for this a joint survey report was submitted by the officer on the basis of which the decision to invoke the provisions of Section and of the Act was taken We have considered the above submission of Sri <NAME> but we fail to agree with the same First the land is sought to be acquired for the plan development of residential colony and there is no recital that it is needed for the purpose of providing infra structure to the International level sports activities much less for the construction of stadium Secondly there is no joint survey report on the record as alleged in which any urgency had been shown for acquiring the land at the time of issuing the impugned notification dated Any subsequently material if any though not on record is not material as the decision about urgency as required to be taken only on the basis of the material on record at the relevant time In view of the above discussions it leaves no scope for us but to hold that there was no material before <ORG> at the relevant time so as to invoke the provisions of Section and of the Act and to dispense with the summary enquiry under Section A of the Act which has the effect of taking away the minimal right of filing statutory objections against the proposed acquisition There is no justification to deviate from the normal procedure and to resort to exceptional mode under the facts and circumstances of the present case Thus the impugned notification issued under Section of the Act is liable to be quashed and is hereby quashed With the above observations writ petition is party allowed and the notification dated under Section of the Act is quashed with no order as to costs <NAME> have been heard in five other connected writ petitions wherein the aforesaid notification issued under Section read with Section of the Act dated has been challenged alongwith final declaration made under Section of the Act dated Sri <NAME> has adopted the arguments of Sri <NAME> and has submitted that the entire acquisition stands vitiated under the Law as there was no urgency to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act and the powers of Section of the Act have been invoked casually in a routine manner without application of mind in as much as there was no material on record to justify the urgency
