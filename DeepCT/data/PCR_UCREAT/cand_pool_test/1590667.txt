The respondent went up in appeal to the Deputy Inspector General of Police but the appeal was dismissed on May Thereupon the respondent filed a writ petition under Art There is no rule with regard to certiorari as there is with mandamus that it will lie only where there is no other equally effective remedy If an inferior <ORG> or tribunal of first instance acts without jurisdiction or in excess of it or contrary to the rules of natural justice the superior <ORG> may quite properly issue a writ of certiorari to correct the error even if an appeal to another inferior <ORG> or tribu nal was available whether recourse was or was not had to it DAS <NAME> is an appeal filed under a certificate of fitness granted by <ORG> at Allahabad under Arts It is directed against the judgment and order of <ORG> of the said <ORG> pronounced on March in Civil Misc Writ No of quashing the depart mental proceedings against the respondent and the orders passed therein namely the order for his dismissal passed by the District Superintendent of Police on December the order of the Deputy Inspector General of Police passed on June dismissing his appeal against the order of his dismissal and the order of the Inspector General of Police dated April rejecting his application for revision The judgment of the <ORG> also directed that if it were desired to proceed against the respondent the trial should be presided over by a person other than the District Superintendent of Police who gave evidence in the case and also passed the order of dismissal against the respondent and that it should be in strict conformity with the relevant Police Regulations As there were only sixty vacancies and as sixty candidates had al ready been selected the <ORG> people were led to make enquiries as to how this letter came to be issued from Lucknow The respondent went up on appeal to the Deputy Inspector General of Police under Reg Having exhausted all his remedies under the Police Act read with the Regulations thereunder the respondent on February filed a writ petition under Art The main point taken in the affidavit filed in support of the petition and urged before <ORG> was that <NAME> District Superintendent of Police who presided over the trial and as such had to come to a finding and to make an order also gave his own evi dence in the proceedings at two stages and had thus become disqualified from continuing as the judge as in the cir cumstances he was bound to be biased against the respondent to deal with the order of dismissal which had been passed at a time when the Constitution of India had not come into force but <ORG> rejected that plea as it took the view that the order of dismissal passed by the District Superin tendent of Police on December and the order of dismissal of the appeal passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police on June had not become final until the Inspector General of Police on April made his order dismissing the revision application filed by the respondent under Reg and that as the last mentioned order had been passed after the Constitution had come into force and had by Art The appellant <ORG> on February obtained from <ORG> a certificate of fitness under Arts There is nothing on the record before us to support this suggestion We find ourselves in agreement with <ORG> that the rules of natural justice were completely discarded and all canons of fair play were grievously violated by <NAME> continuing to preside over the trial Learned counsel appearing for the appellant <ORG> then urges that assuming that any error irregularity or illegality had been committed by <NAME> in the course of the trial held by him a writ application under art Reference is made to of the Police Act which subject to such rules as the <ORG> Government may make under the Act gives power to certain specified Police Officers of high rank to dismiss suspend or reduce any Police Officer of the subordinate ranks whom they may think remiss or negligent in the discharge of his duties or unfit for the same In this case admittedly the respondent preferred an appeal and then went up to <NAME> in revision The respondent knew the material facts and must be deemed to have been conscious of his legal rights in the matter and therefore if he failed to raise the objection before the officer who was dealing with his appeal or revision he cannot it is urged be permitted to do so for the first time on a writ petition under Art On the other hand if he had raised the question in his grounds of appeal or in his revision petition and insisted on it at the hearing of his appeal or his revision application then the orders of dismissal of his appeal and his revision petition by authorities fully competent and having full powers and jurisdiction to decide the question must be taken as a rejection of that plea on its merits and as no error or irregularity or illegality is alleged to have been committed at the stages of the appeal or the revision proceedings <ORG> could not under Art Their Convictions and sentences had been Confirmed by <ORG> before January when the Constitution of India came into force praying for a writ in the nature of certiorari calling Upon the Government of Hyderabad and the Special Judge to produce the records of the case and to show cause why the convictions and sentences should not be quashed and for a writ of prohibition directing the Government and the Special Judge not to execute the petitioners As regards the several points complaining of alleged illegality by reason of misjoinder of charges and the infliction of the sentence of death by hanging and not decapitation this <ORG> at page observed But for the purpose of the present case it is sufficient to point out that even if we assume that there was some defect in the procedure followed at the trial it does not follow that the trial court acted without jurisdiction There is a basic difference between want of jurisdiction and an illegal or irregular exercise of jurisdiction and our attention has not been drawn to any authority in which mere non compliance with the rules of procedure has been made a ground for granting one of the writs prayed for In either case the defect if any can according to the procedure established by law be corrected only by a court of appeal or revision Here the appellate court which was competent to deal with the matter has pronounced its judgment against the petitioners and the matter Then this <ORG> went on to consider the remaining question namely whether after the commencement of the Constitution this <ORG> could exercise its newly acquired jurisdiction under Art It was urged that it was open to the petitioners to prove by affidavit that the court which passed the order had acted without jurisdiction or in excess of it and the superior court was free to investigate the matter After stating that a return that the persons were in detention in execution of sentences on indictment on criminal charges was a sufficient answer to the application for a writ of habeas corpus this <ORG> proceeded at pages to observe as follows Assuming however that it is open even in such cases to investigate the question of jurisdiction as was held in In re Authers it appears to us that the learned judges who decided that case went too far in holding that notwithstanding the fact that the conviction and sentence had been upheld on appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction the mere fact that the trial court had acted without jurisdiction would justify interference treating the appellate order as a nullity Evidently <ORG> in a case which properly comes before it on appeal is fully competent to decide whether the trial was with or without jurisdiction and it has jurisdiction to decide the matter rightly as well as wrongly If it affirms the conviction I and thereby decides wrongly that the trial court had the jurisdiction to try and convict it cannot be said to have acted without jurisdiction and its order cannot be treated as a nullity It is true that there is no such thing as the principle of constructive res judicata in a criminal case but there is such a principle as finality of judgments which applies to criminal as well as civil cases and is implicit in every system wherein provisions are to be found for correcting errors in appeal or in revision In the first place it must be noted that the two obser vations quoted from the decision of this Court on which reliance is placed on behalf of the appellant <ORG> were made in a case where the alleged error irregularity or illegality was committed by a special tribunal which had not merely the trappings of a court but was a court of law presided over by a judge with legal training and background and bound by rules of evidence and procedure laid down for it and the appeal from its decision lay before the highest and final court of the <ORG> a superior court of record In the next place it must be borne in mind that there is no rule with regard to certiorari as there is with mandamus that it will lie only where there is no other equally effective remedy that the aggrieved party has another and adequate remedy may be taken into consideration by the superior court in arriving at a conclusion as to whether it should in exercise of its discretion issue a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings and decisions of inferior courts subordinate to it and ordinarily the superior court will decline to interfere until the aggrieved party has exhausted his other statutory remedies if any But this rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies before the writ will be granted is a rule of policy convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law and instances are numerous where a writ of certiorari has been issued in spite of the fact that the aggrieved party had other adequate legal remedies In the <NAME> Postmaster General Ex parte <NAME> a certiorari was issued although the aggrieved party had an alternative remedy by way of appeal At page Viscount Caldecote observed It remains to consider the argument that the remedy of certiorari is not open to the applicant because others were available It would mean asking this court to consider as a question of law whether justices were right in convicting a man without hearing his evidence As to the right of appeal to quarter sessions it may be that the applicant could have had his remedy if he But it appears to me that there can be cases where the court can and should issue a certiorari even where such alternative remedies are available Where a <ORG> or <ORG> which is called upon to exercise judicial or quasi judicial functions discards all rules of natural justice and arrives at a decision contrary to all accepted principles of justice then it appears to me that the court can and must interfere If therefore the existence of other adequate legal remedies is not per se a bar to the issue of a writ of certiorari and if in a proper case it may be the duty of the superior court to issue a writ of certiorari to correct the errors of an inferior court or tribunal called upon to exercise judicial or quasi judicial functions and not to relegate the petitioner to other legal remedies available to him and if the superior court can in a proper case exercise its jurisdiction A I Bom in favour of a petitioner who has allowed the time to appeal to expire or has not perfected his appeal by furnishing security required by the statute should it then be laid down as an inflexible rule of law that the superior court must deny the writ when an inferior court or tribunal by discarding all principles of natural justice and all accepted rules of procedure arrived at a conclusion which shocks the sense of justice and fair play merely because such decision has been upheld by another inferior court or tribunal on appeal or revision The case of In re <NAME> referred to in <NAME> case furnishes the answer Evidently the point was taken that if there had been any error irregularity or illegality committed by the magistrate the quarter sessions could have on appeal corrected the same and that the quarter sessions having dismissed the appeal the court of Queen Bench Division could not issue the writ of habeas corpus This was repelled by the following observation of <NAME> This is true as a fact but it puts the prosecution in no better position for if the magistrate had no power to give himself jurisdiction by finding that there had been a first offence where there had been none the justices could not give it to him On the authorities referred to above it appears to us that there may conceivably be cases and the instant If an inferior court or tribunal of first instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or manifestly conducts the proceedings before it in a manner which is contrary to the rules of natural justice and all accepted rules of procedure and which offends the superior court sense of fair play the superior court may we think quite properly exercise its power to issue the prerogative writ of certiorari to correct the error of the court or tribunal of first instance even if an appeal to another inferior court or tribunal was available and recourse was not had to it or if recourse was had to it confirmed what ex facie was a nullity for reasons aforementioned The superior court will ordinarily decline to interfere by issuing certiorari and all we say is that in a proper case of the kind mentioned above it has the power to do so and may and should exercise it Learned counsel for the appellant <ORG> next urges that because the order of dismissal was passed by the District Superintendent of Police on December and the order dismissing the appeal was passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police on June both of which were before the commencement of the Constitution <ORG> could not exercise its powers under Art This argument is countered by the respondent by the argument that the dismissal order of December did not become final until after the Inspector General of Police had dismissed the revision application on April that is to say after the Constitution came into force and therefore <ORG> had ample power to quash all the three orders It has been held in a series of decisions of <ORG>s some of which are referred to in the judgment under appeal that Art It is therefore conceded that if the matter had rested with the order of dismissal passed by the District Superintendent of Police on April and the order passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police on June dismissing the appeal and confirming the order for the dismissal of the respondent an application for a writ under Art It is however contended that the order of dismissal dated April had merged in the order passed on appeal on June and that both the orders merged in the order passed by the Inspector General of Police on April on the revision application It is said that the revisional jurisdiction is a part of the appellate jurisdiction and the principle on which a decree of the court of first instance in a civil suit merges in the decree on appeal applies with equal force to an order made on an application for revision and consequently both the orders passed by the District Superintendent of Police and that passed on appeal by the Deputy Inspector General of Police merged in the order passed on revision by the Inspector General of Police on April To put it shortly the contention of the respondent is that the order of dismissal passed on April became final only on the passing of the order in revision on April and as that order was passed after the date of the commencement of the Constitution its validity could be called in question on an application under Art As we have already observed an order of dismissal passed on a departmental enquiry by an officer in the department and an order passed by another officer next higher in rank dis missing an appeal therefrom and an order rejecting an application for revision by the head of the department can hardly be equated with any propriety with decrees made in a civil suit under the Code of Civil Procedure by the court of first instance and the decree dismissing the appeal there from by an appeal court and the order dismissing the revision petition by a yet higher court as has been sought to be done by <ORG> in this case because the departmental tribunals of the first instance or on appeal or revision are not regular courts manned by persons trained in law although they may have the trappings of the courts of law The danger of so doing is evident from what has happened in the very case now before us There is nothing in the Indian Law to warrant the suggestion that the decree or order of the court or tribunal of the first instance becomes final only on the termination of all proceedings by way of appeal or revision The original order of dismissal if there were no inherent infirmities in it was operative on its own strength and it did not gain any greater efficacy from the subsequent orders of dismissal of the appeal or the revision except for the specific purposes hereinbelow mentioned That order of dismissal having been passed before the Constitution and rights having accrued to the appellant <ORG> and liabilities having attached to the respondent before the Constitution came into force the subsequent conferment of jurisdiction and powers on <ORG> can have no retrospective operation on such rights and liabilities The appeal is therefore allowed but in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs once a competent <ORG> of appeal has finally decided whether a <ORG> subordinate to it has jurisdiction or not in a given matter I also accept the position that the Constitution is not retrospective and that the <ORG>s cannot exercise any new jurisdiction and powers conferred by it to reopen decisions and orders that had become final before it came into being I see no reason why any narrow or ultra technical restrictions should be placed on them What is the position here What would have been the result if the order of April dismissing the respondent had been passed after the Constitution instead of before it At what point of time would the High <ORG> have entertained a petition under Art It is true that on a matter of jurisdiction or on a question that goes to the root of the case the High <ORG> can entertain a petition at an earlier stage but they are not bound to do so and a petition would not be thrown out because the petitioner had done that which the <ORG> usually direct him to do namely to exhaust his normal remedies before invoking an extraordinary jurisdiction It is true that if it had been passed before the Constitution came into force on January the petitioner would have had no remedy in the Courts Why should they be viewed narrowly Why should not that which would have been regarded as still pending for present purposes if all had been done after the Constitution be construed in any different way when the final act which is the decisive one for these purposes was done after it I regard it as unduly narrow and restrictive to equate these broad based constitutional privileges to highly technical procedural decisions dealing with limitation and the merger of decrees The Departmental Rules that require an enquiry in such cases call the The matter is as I said covered by authority and I need say no more except that even if it were not I would have had no hesitation in reaching the same conclusion I would dismiss the appeal
