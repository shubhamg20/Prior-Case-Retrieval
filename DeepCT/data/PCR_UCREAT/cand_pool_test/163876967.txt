of the statements made by the injured witnesses <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW as corroborated by the postmortem report seizure of jewellery hammer blood stained clothes Ex First ground taken by the learned counsel for the appellant with respect to denial of opportunity to the accused to be defended by a counsel of his choice is incorrect as from the record we find that proper opportunity was given to the accused The order sheets of <ORG> dated th September shows that the appellant made an application that appellant wanted to get the witnesses cross examined by senior Advocate Mr <NAME> therefore he requested to defer the cross examination of the witnesses On th September when the case was fixed for evidence though he was competent to cross examine the witnesses but he moved the application to defer the cross examination of the witnesses on the ground that the accused wanted to engage senior Advocate Mr <NAME> Since there was none to represent the accused <ORG> appointed Mr <NAME> Advocate to pursue the appeal The next question is whether death sentence awarded to the appellant is excessive disproportionate on the facts and circumstance of the case i whether the present case can be termed to be a rarest of the rare case ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered a Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender Whether the case is one of the rarest of the rare cases is a question which has to be determined on the facts of each case Concern for the dignity of the human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentalities and that ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases unless the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed In exercise of its discretion the court would also take into consideration the mitigating circumstances and their resultant effects ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also requires to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases the court shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance this Court took the view that custodial torture and consequential death in custody was an offence which fell in the category of the rarest of rare cases The Court felt that there was no evidence to show that the criminals were pic incapable of reforming themselves that it was not a rarest of the rare case and therefore declined to award death sentence to the accused Thus applying the doctrine of prudence it noticed the fact that the accused were unemployed young men in search of job and they were not criminals The court would consider the cumulative effect of both these aspects and normally it may not be very appropriate for the court to decide the most significant aspect of sentencing policy with reference to one of the classes under any of the following heads while completely ignoring other classes under other heads It will be appropriate for the court to come to a final conclusion upon pic balancing the exercise that would help to administer the criminal justice system better and provide an effective and meaningful reasoning by the court as contemplated under Section CrPC by the accused with a prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences committed by the person having a substantial history of serious assaults and criminal convictions The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity and meanness Where the court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that the crime was not committed in a preordained manner and that the death resulted in the course of commission of another crime and that there was a possibility of it being construed as consequences to the commission of the primary crime Principles The court has to apply the test to determine if it was the rarest of rare case for imposition of a death sentence The option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be cautiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all relevant considerations If there is any circumstance favouring the accused like lack of intention to commit the crime possibility of reformation young age of the accused not a menace to the society no previous track record etc There is nothing specific to suggest the motive for committing the crime except the articles and cash taken away by the accused It is true that the accused has committed a heinous crime but it cannot be held with certainty that this case falls in the rarest of the rare category
