HEADNOTE Entry of the Union List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution confers power for the regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the union is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules made under the Act which came into force on October gave power to the <ORG> Government to frame rules for the regulation and development of minor minerals as defined in the Rules The appellant purchased in a lease for quarrying minor minerals as defined in Act of from a vendor who had taken the original lease from the then landlords in Rule of the said Bihar Rules as originally framed provided for realisation of dead rent royalty and surface rent in respect of leases granted or renewed would also apply to leases granted or renewed prior to the date of the commencement of the Act and subsisting on such date The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> Dissatisfied with the judgment of that court the appellant came to this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellant i that the subject of regulation of mines and mineral development came within the exclusive jurisdiction of <ORG> as a result of the passing of Act of with the result that the <ORG> Legislature was left with no power to pass the second proviso to and the said proviso was therefore ultra vires ii that being without legislative support could not touch a lease granted in It goes on to state in that the <ORG> Government may by notification make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith and in that till such rules iii The contentions raised on behalf of the <ORG> must be rejected a The abolition of the rights of intermediaries in the mines and vesting of these rights as lessors in the <ORG> Government was a topic connected with land and land tenures But after the mining leases stood between the <ORG> Government and the leases any attempt to regulate those mining leases will fall not in entry but in entry The pith and substance of the amendment to of the Reforms Act falls within entry although it incidentally touches land Appeals from the judgments and orders dated November December and December of <ORG> in Nos The facts of all the four cases are similar and the same points arise for determination He sold his rights title and interest by a registered sale deed on September to the present appellant Subsisting leases of mines and minerals

section shall not come into force until they have been approved either with or without modification by <ORG> The rules made under sub section shall provide a for giving previous notice of the modification or alteration proposed to be made thereunder to the lessee and when the lessor is not <ORG> also to the lessor and for affording them an opportunity of showing cause against the proposal Section provided that <ORG> might by notification direct that any power exercisable under that Act might be exercised subject to such conditions if any as might be specified by such officer or authority or might be specified in the direction It came into force from December We are primarily concerned with this Act in these appeals The Act of came into force on st June and extended to the whole of India It contained the following declaration in It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under the control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided Prospecting or mining operations to be under license or lease No person shall undertake any prospecting or mining operations in any area except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a prospecting licence or as the case may be a mining lease granted under this Act and the rules made thereunder Provided that nothing in

sub section of section The Central Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of sub section and in particular such rules shall provide a for giving previous notice of the modification or alteration proposed to be made in any existing mining lease to the lessee and where the lessor is not <ORG> also to the lessor and for affording him an opportunity of showing cause against the proposal The argument of the appellant is that apart from the provisions of the nd proviso to added to the Land Reforms Act in by Act IV of and second sub rule added to rule of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules there is no power to modify the terms With regard to <ORG> it is contended that the scheme of the relevant entries in the Union and State List is that to the extent to which regulation of mines and mineral development is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest the subject of legislation is withdrawn from the jurisdiction of <ORG> and therefore Act of leaves no legislative field to <ORG> to enact Act of amending the Land Reforms Act These are the two matters which need decision That the Bihar Rules in so far as they make demands of rent and royalty on the existing leases which were executed prior to their coming into force are beyond the power to make rules in respect of minor minerals under of Act of that itself is unconstitutional and void because it delegates legislative power to the rule making authority and it is excessive delegation and that the amendment of Bihar Land Reforms Act is void because it affects the fundamental rights of the appellants guaranteed under Articles and of the Constitution However considering further whether a declaration made by a <ORG> law could be regarded as a declaration by <ORG> for the purpose of entry it was held that it could not and there was thus a lacuna which the Adaptation of Therefore it was held that there was room for legislation by <ORG> After the provisions came into force a demand was made for payment of fees due from July to March and the demand was challenged It was held on appeal that since Act of contained the requisite declaration by <ORG> under entry and that Act covered the same field as the Act of in regard to mines and mineral development the ruling in Hingir Rampur case applied and as ss and of the Act of were very wide ruled out legislation by <ORG> Where a superior legislature evinced an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after must be held to be overborne As covered the entire field there was no scope for the argument that till rules were framed under that section room was available The other side must of course show that the matter is already covered and there is no room for legislation It goes on to state in that the <ORG> Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith and that until rules are made any rules made by the <ORG> Government regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining lease in respect of minor minerals which were in force immediately before the commencement of Therefore there is no room for <ORG> legislation Mr <NAME> argued that the topic of legislation concerns land and therefore falls under entry of the State List and he drew our attention to other provisions on the subject of mines in the Land Reforms Act as originally passed The abolition of the rights of intermediaries in the mines and vesting these rights as lessors in <ORG> was a topic connected with land and land tenures But after the mining leases stood between <ORG> and the lessees any attempt to regulate those mining leases will fall not in entry but in entry even though the regulation incidentally touches land The pith and substance of the amendment to of the Reforms Act falls within entry although it incidentally touches land and not vice versa We have also held that entry of List II was to that extent cut down by entry of List I The whole of the topic of minor minerals became a <ORG> subject In regard to leases of minor minerals executed between this date and December when Rule was enacted there is no provision of law which enables the terms of existing leases to be altered We have also held that vested rights could only be taken away by law made by a competent legislature
