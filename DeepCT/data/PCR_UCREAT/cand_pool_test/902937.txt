The assessee company was assessed to tax on its business profits for the assessment year and it claimed various expenses as allowable deductions aggregating to Rs The view taken by the Income tax Officer was that the assessee company had only commenced business when it purchased the groundnut mill on the st of November and therefore he disallowed all the expenses which were incurred prior to the st of November The assessee company went in appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and substantially the view taken by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was that the expenses incurred after getting the certificate of commencement of the business should be treated as expenses incurred for the purpose of carrying on the business in the year of account and therefore barring the sum of Rs They also took the view that some time must have been taken in making arrangements for the purchases and therefore the material date they fixed was the st of September and they disallowed the expenses previous to the st of September and allowed expenses subsequent to that date The Income tax Officer fixed the date as the st of November on the basis of the purchase of the ground nut oil mill the Appellate Assistant Commissioner fixed the th of April as the date on which the certificate of commencement of business was granted to the company and the <ORG> fixed the st of September as the date on the basis that some time should be allowed to the assessee company prior to the actual purchase of raw materials Now having perused the statement of the case we are inclined to agree with the <ORG> that the appropriate question which should have been referred to us was Whether there was evidence before the <ORG> to hold that the assessee company commenced its business as from st of September The question that we asked the <ORG> to refer carried in it an implication that the only fact that the <ORG> took into consideration was that the first transaction of purchase of raw materials took place at the end of September That underlying assumption seems to be incorrect because in the statement of the case of <ORG> points out that there were many other facts taken into account in fixing the date of the commencement of the business like certificate of commencement of business the date of the purchase of the mills the details of the expenses given in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and so on Mr <NAME> has placed strong reliance on the judgment of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and also on the various items of expenses which have been allowed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the whole gravamen of Mr <NAME> charge against the <ORG> is that the <ORG> has overlooked the nature of these expenses and has not applied its mind to them and Mr <NAME> says that the order of the <ORG> makes it clear that they did not take into consideration these expenses They have told us that they have taken into consideration the details of the expenses given in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner Therefore the question that we have ultimately to answer and which is the real question that arises on the order of the <ORG> is whether there was evidence before the <ORG> for holding that the assessee company commenced its business as from the st of September Now it is rather unfortunate that in the order of the <ORG> and also in the question which they themselves have suggested really arises they should have used the expression commenced although in fairness to the <ORG> it may be pointed out that the very interesting question which has been debated at the <ORG> was never urged argued or even suggested before the <ORG> and the question that has been raised before us is that there is a distinction and a clear distinction between a person commencing a business and a person setting up a business and that for the purposes of the Indian law what we have to consider is the setting up of a business and not the commencement of a business Now turning to our statute the deductions claimed are under Section and they are in relation to a business and in order that those deductions can be allowed the business must be carried on by the assessee Let us try and understand whether there is any difference between the two expressions setting up and commenced and if so what is the difference Now this is indeed a very strong case on facts in support of the Commissioner because the view taken by Mr Justice <NAME> is that everything that had been done by the company before the installation of the plant and machinery was completed was preparatory to the commencement of the business and it was only when the company actually started receiving raw materials for the purpose of manufacture into finished products the plant and machinery being ready that it could be said that the assessee company had commenced business and this is what the learned Judge says at page Referring to their minutes having looked round and having got their machinery and plant and having also employed their foremen and having got their works erected and generally got everything ready then they began to take the raw materials and to turn out their products Therefore if this case were to be applied to the present assessee then we would be driven to the conclusion that if anything the <ORG> has taken a view of the case very favourable to the assessee because on the facts of this case it would seem that the Income tax Officer was right in holding that the net expenses prior to the st of November should not be allowed as permissible deductions The distinction is this that when a business is established and is ready to commence business then it can be said of that business that it is set up But prior to this there was a period when the business could be said to have been set up and the company was ready to commence business and in the view of the <ORG> one of the main factors was the purchase of raw materials from which an inference could be drawn that the company had set up its business but that is not the only factor that the <ORG> has taken into consideration The <ORG> has as pointed out in the statement of the case scrutinised the various details of the expenses given in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and having scrutinised those expenses the <ORG> has come to the conclusion even on an interpretation more favourable to the assessee than the one we are giving to the expression setting up that these expenses do not show that the business was set up prior to the st of September It is only if there is no evidence which would justify the decision of the <ORG> that a question of law would arise which would invoke our advisory jurisdiction which after all is a very limited jurisdiction We will therefore redraft the question submitted by the <ORG> as follows whether there was evidence before the <ORG> to hold that the assessee company set up its business as from st of September and we will answer that in the affirmative
