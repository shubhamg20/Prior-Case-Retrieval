Notice was given to the two petitioners on th February to produce <NAME> in <ORG> on th February Section provides Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> by which a bond under this Code has been taken or of the <ORG> of a Presidency Magistrate or Magistrate of the st Class or when the bond is for appearance before a <ORG> to the satisfaction of such <ORG> that such bond has been forfeited the <ORG> shall record the grounds of such proof and may call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the penalty thereof or to show cause why it should not be so paid In my judgment the provisions of this section indicate that two steps are to be taken first it must be proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> that the bond has been forfeited whereupon the <ORG> is to record the grounds of such proof secondly the <ORG> on being satisfied as aforesaid may call upon the person bound by such bond to pay the penalty thereof or to show cause why it should not be paid It appears that notice was given to the petitioners to show cause why the bail bond should not be forfeited On that occasion it was admitted by them that they had executed the bond and that they had received notice on th February to produce <NAME> on th February and the learned Judge expressed the opinion that a reasonable time had been allowed for the attendance of <NAME> It does not appear whether the question as to the time allowed being sufficient and reasonable was contested or not If there is anything in this point it will be open to the petitioners to raise it on the further hearing which we propose to direct In effect however his judgment amounted to a finding that it had been proved that the bond had been forfeited and there is no doubt that he recorded the grounds of such proof I am not aware whether the petitioners will be able to produce any reasons other than those already advanced why the penalty should not be paid but it is desirable that the provisions of the section should be observed and the result in my judgment is that the Rule should be made absolute and the matter should be remanded in order that the learned Judge may call upon the petitioner to pay the penalty of the bond or to show cause why it should not be paid The Rule therefore is made absolute and the matter remanded to the learned Judge so that if he thinks it necessary to proceed further with the matter he may take the steps which are prescribed in Section Criminal and which are indicated in our judgment
