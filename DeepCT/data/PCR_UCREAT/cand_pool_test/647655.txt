HEADNOTE In <ORG> granted a lease of land for ten years to a partnership firm with the covenant that the lessee would at their own expense construct upon the said land certain buildings to the specification There was a claim for Rs The Tenants may during the period of notice for determination of tenancy hereby in accordance with proviso No herein before contained remove such buildings as have been standing upon the demised land provided that the Tenants shall have paid all rent hereby reserved up to the determination of this tenancy and shall have performed and observed all the covenants on the part of the Tenants and the conditions herein contained or referred to to the assignors and this assignment appears to have been accepted by the lessors On January the Trustees of the port of Bombay sent a notice to <NAME> and <NAME> requiring them to vacate the premises and deliver He raised a plea of jurisdiction alleging that the suit had to be filed in <ORG> Bombay inasmuch as it was governed by the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging Houses Rates Control Act It was held that the tenancy was a joint tenancy that a notice to one of the joint tenants was sufficient and that the suit also was not bad for non joinder of the legal representatives of <NAME> For same reason the trial Judge also held that the suit was properly laid in <ORG> at Bombay The same contentions were raised before us and we shall deal with them in the same order The argument about notice need not detain us long By the deed of assignment dated February the tenants took the premises as joint tenants the Assignors do and each of them both hereby assign and assure with the Assignees as Joint Tenants The deed of assignment was approved and accepted by the Trustees of <ORG> and <NAME> and the appellant must be regarded as joint tenants In our opinion the notice and the frame of the suit were therefore proper and this argument has no merit We shall therefore consider these two points together It must not be overlooked that the suit was for eviction from the land only Under the Rent Control Act the word premises is defined by inter alia as follows Premises means any land not being used for agricultural purposes A suit was filed by <ORG> against its own tenants in <ORG> This <ORG> on appeal by special leave reversed the decision of the High <ORG> and restored that of the Trial Judge There is one more reason in this case for reaching the same conclusion because at the time of the lease in the lessees from whom the appellant claims assignment were given a lease not only of the land but of the buildings It was a monthly tenancy liable to be terminated with a notice under the Transfer of Property Act and there was only a grace that the lessees when evicted might remove buildings within one month of their eviction It was contended that the contract was incapable of being performed because at least between the present appellant and his sub tenants the provisions of the Rent Control Act would apply and he would not be able to evict them in his turn Whether or not the <ORG> authorities would be able hereafter to evict the sub tenants of the appellant is a matter on which we need not express any opinion The are only claiming vacant possession of the sited and under the agreement if the appellant does not remove the buildings within one month then they would be entitled to take possession of the land with the buildings whatever might be the rights of the sub tenants and as to which as we have pointed out already we say nothing In our opinion the appeal must fail and is dismissed but in the circumstances of the case we do not make any order about costs
