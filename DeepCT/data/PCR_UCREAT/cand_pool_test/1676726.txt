The documents filed on behalf of the plaintiffs are voluminous preserved into several boxes They are I that admittedly the plaintiffs have not secured renewal of the registration of their trade mark in India since the reasons being inconsequential Admittedly plaintiff No did not have full scale commercial use of the trademark in India this would amount to abandonment of the trademark by plaintiff No II that the plaintiffs cannot claim the said trademark <ORG> having become associated with the plaintiffs in the mind of the customers in India any right by user of any trademark in regard to trade and exclusive right to use the same by any person can only be territorial in nature nobody can claim exclusive right to use a trademark in a territory or locality where it has not sold the goods with the said trademark or acquired any reputation therein of any exclusive appropriation or use of the trademark III that the defendants have secured the registration of the trademark <ORG> in India On the <ORG> Registrar of Trademarks passed an order dismissing the opposition and allowing the application to proceed for registration According to the defendants there is a delay of five years and eight months in bringing the present suit by the plaintiffs calculated from the initiation by <ORG> of the proceedings for registration of the trademark <ORG> putting the plaintiffs on notice of the defendants adoption and use of the trademark The principles as to the grant of interim injunction in cases relating to infringement of trade mark and passing off actions are too well settled to be restated The questions of prima facie case balance of convenience and irreparable injury would be examined and the case decided thereon just like any other case In the opinion of this court the issues arising for decision between the parties at this stage may be crystallised into the following four specially keeping in view the emphasis in submissions made by the learned counsel for both the sides If plaintiff No was not having any sales in India but was having sales in the trademark <ORG> in other countries geographical regions of the world can the plaintiffs have the benefit of trans border reputation so as to maintain passing off action in India or should their goodwill reputation be treated confined to territories in which they have proved actual user of the trade mark in market Whether the plaintiff No can be deemed to have abandoned the trademark Whirlpool in India since A What is the effect of registration of the trade mark in India obtained by a defendant on a passing off action filed by one who does not have such registration What is the effect of the pendency of appeal against the order of registration of trademark Whether the plaintiffs can be justifiably accused of culpable delay acquiescence and Laches so as to disentitle them from the relief of injunction Question No It cannot be denied that A perusal of the affidavits and the documents filed on behalf of the plaintiffs leads to the following factual inferences A Documented sales to India of <ORG> branded products Date Particulars Documents Us Govt stand arise Ex Territorial extent of rights altough there is some authority to the effect that the right of property in a trademark is not limited in its enjoyment by territorial bounds the general rule in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary is that the right to the exclusive use of a trademark or trade name is limited to the territory of markets wherein it has become established as such by actual use However is unclear whether there is an additional requirement that the plaintiff must carry on business in or at least have a trade extending to the country in which he seeks to restrain the defendant from using the mark or name or whether the geographical separation of the plaintiff business from the defendant is factual element which merely makes it difficult but not impossible in all circumstances for a plaintiff to show that the defendant activities are likely to cause him substantial damage What is clear is that a plaintiff who has no place of business in the United Kingdom and does not directly trade there but whose goods are imported by others can acquire a reputation and goodwill that is able to be protected If goodwill is to be treated as a matter of law as stopping at frontiers there may still be cases where the defendant activities are likely to cause damage to the plaintiff business in the country or countries where he trades They are trans borders reputation and agreeing with what was said by <ORG> I agreed in <ORG> case Arb Law Report at page with what was stated by <ORG> by observing as under I stated in the <ORG> case at page as under It is not necessary in the context of the present day circumstances the free exchange of information and advertising through newspapers magazines video television movies freedom of travel between various parts of the world to insist that a particular plaintiff must carry on business in a jurisdiction before improper use of its name or mark can be restrained by the court In passing off cases the main consideration is the likelihood of confusion and consequential injury to the plaintiff and the need to protect the public from deception deliberate or otherwise where such confusion or deception is prima facie shown to exist protection should be given by courts to the name or mark or goodwill of the plaintiff In <ORG> where the matter was settled by an application filed under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure the observations made by me were not modified varied or set aside under Order Rule Civil Procedure Code as they were apparently found to be lawful What may be adequate evidence to establish trans border live reputation To quote <NAME> TRANS BORDERreputation of the plaintiff has been in my view established sufficiently in this country by means of the fact that the sales of Glenfiddich takes place on duty free shops in India by the fact that advertisement of Glenfiddich whisky are to be found in various magazines like the In house magazine of <ORG> and other foreign publications which are freely available in India some of which have been placed on record of this case as a result of which in my view Glenfiddich whisky has a live reputation in India It is no doubt true that an action for passing off relates to the business and it must be established that the plaintiff has a reputation or goodwill of his business in this country The principle of law of passing off has been also made applicable to non trading business or non profit mating bodies as well Bahri has further approved the view that trade mark law is not intended to protect a person who deliberately sets out to take benefit of somebody else reputation with reference to goods especially so when the reputation extends worldwide I am bound by the view taken by the two learned single Judges of this Court in the cases decided earlier and referred to hereinabove Having lost there at the plaintiffs have preferred an appeal which is pending There is no question of acquiescence by the plaintiffs Having lost before the Assistant Registrar the plaintiffs have preferred an appeal and also filed this suit The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under sub section shall be subject to any conditions and limitations in which the registration is subject Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trade marks which are identical with or nearly resemble each other the exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks shall not except so far as their respective rights are subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any other of those persons merely by registration of the trade marks by each of those persons has otherwise the same rights as against other persons not being registered users using by way of permitted use as he would have if he were the sole registered proprietor It has an overriding effect on all the other provisions of the Act <NAME> in his Law of Trade marks and Passing Off Fourth Edition sums up the law vide para at pp in the following words Registration does not confer immunity against passing off The provisions of the Act including those or registration do not affect rights of action against any person for passing off goods as the goods of another or the remedies in respect thereof That registration itself does not create a trade mark A single actual use with intent to continue such use eo instanti confers a right jto such mark as a trade mark Proof of actual damage or fraud is unnecessary in a passing off action whether the relief asked for is injunction alone or injunction account and damages If there is likelihood of the offending trade mark invading he proprietary right a case for injunction is made out Strong reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the defendant on a few decisions of this Court which have all been distinguished or commented upon on by Mr <NAME> Advocate for the plaintifs In <ORG> case supra the learned single Judge has referred to <ORG> case supra but vide para the learned judge has disposed off the law laid down by <ORG> in para and of its judgment as mere observations The view to the contrary taken by the learned single Judge in Field <NAME> case supra and other case does not either take note of or follow <ORG> nor take note of Section of the Act Para an infringement action is available when there is violation of specific property right acquired under and recognised by the statute In addition it has to be kept in view that there is vast difference in the prices of the machines of the plaintiffs and defendants which would unable the defendants washing machines being passed off as plaintiffs It has rightly been pointed out that the defendants are not going to suffer any injury inasmuch as even if they have manufactured any washing machines they have only to remove and replace the small metallic strip bearing the offensive trade mark name which includes <ORG> It is not necessary to deal with at length on this submission for the simple reason that as already noticed this <ORG> has formed an opinion that the registration of the <ORG> as trade mark of the defendants was of no consequence in passing off action This order too would not have any effect on the registration proceedings sub judice in appeal which shall be decided on its own merits I have avoided the need of doing so in this case at this stage inasmuch as what is being disposed of is an interlocutory matter after all and inviting decision by <ORG> or a larger bench would have merely delayed the matter further During the course of hearing Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs had expressed willingness of the plaintiffs to file undertaking for compensating the defendant for the loss and damages incurred by them in the event of the plaintiffs suit failing The plaintiffs shall within weeks from today place on record an undertaking in the shape of affidavits sworn in by their duly constituted attorney or representative undertaking to indemnify the defendants from any loss or damage which the defendants may incur on account of these proceedings and determined in this suit or any other duly constituted legal proceedings in the event of the plaintiffs being held not entitled to the relief sought for in the suit Legal contentions have all been raised by either party and dealt with by this order
