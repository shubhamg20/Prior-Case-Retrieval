The assessee claimed a deduction of an amount equal to of the profits which were attributable in respect of an activity mentioned in The th Schedule to section of the Income tax Act The profits attributable to the business of tea plantation amounted to Rs On this amount the assessee claimed a deduction equal to It was inter alia contended that under section the assessee was entitled to a deduction at the rate of from the profits and gains of an activity specified in the list in the th schedule The said deduction is not on the total income as determined but is restricted to the profit which is attributable to the activity as specified in the th Schedule Reliance in this context was placed on the decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> case their Lordships were concerned with the dividend that was declared by a company which was entitled for a relief under section on the shareholder assessment The total income according to him is computed by aggregating the profits and losses of different businesses carried on by an assessee The assessee came up in further appeal before <ORG> The Income tax Officer action in deducting from the income attributable to an activity specified in the th Schedule of a loss from another activity not mentioned therein could not be justified on any grounds In this context it referred to the provisions of section which are in the following term In the case of a company to which this section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other from of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent The section further postulates that if such a total income includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in th Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to thereof in computing the total income of the company The decision relied upon by the learned departmental representative was distinguished on the ground that it was in connection with the operation of a provision which did not create such a differentiation It affirmed the fact that in computing the total income liable to tax various factors have to be taken into consideration In that view of the matter <ORG> held that the assessee was entitled to a relief of Rs From the aforesaid order of <ORG> the following question of law arise Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was justified in holding that for the purpose of allowing a deduction under section of the Income tax Act the words such profits occurring in that section mean the profits and gains attributable to an activity as specified in the th Schedule before deducting any loss incurred in any business activity This is a reference under section of the Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act It also carries on the business of manufacture of plastic bags and polythene pipes used for spraying etc Section of the Act as it stood at the relevant period allowed to an assessee a deduction of per cent of the profits and gains attributable to the priority industry accordingly the assessee claimed a deduction of Rs only which works out at Rs Then the department obtained a reference to this court of the following question of la Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was justified in holding that for the purpose of allowing a deduction under section of Income tax Act the words such profits occurring in that section mean the profits an gains attributable to activity as specified in the th Schedule before deducting any loss incurred in any business activity The learned counsel on both sides submitted that there is no decision of any court on the question before us The said section has now been replaced by section I In the case of a company to which this section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of their Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other from job power of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction form such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight percent Briefly state the argument of <NAME> was that the effect of this provision it that the deduction under section will be allowed from the profit from the specified priority industries as computed after allowing all the deduction admissible in computing the business income under sections to of the Act and also after giving effect to the relevant provisions for set off or carry forward of loss contained in Chapter VI of the Act Section accordance with the provisions contained in sections to A Section is found in Chapter VI A under the head other deductions to be made in computing the total income It will be observed that the deduction under section referred to above is allowable in computing the profits and gains from the specified priority industries INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL INCOME AS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS of the Income tax Act The effect of this provision is that the deduction under section will be allowed from the profits from the specified priority industries as computed AFTER allowing all the deductions admissible in computing the business income under sections to of the Income tax Act and also after giving effect to the relevant provisions for set off or carry forward of loss Contained in Chapter VI of that Act In such a case a question may arise as to whether the loss of the relevant previous year under a head other than Profits and gains of business or profession or the business loss carried forward from earlier years should be set off on a proportionate basis both against the profits from the specified priority industries and the profits from other business activities We are unable to agree with the views of <ORG> that the effect of the provision is that the deduction under section will be allowed from the profits from the specified priority industries as computed after allowing all the deductions admissible in computing the business income under section to of the Act The first pre requisite condition in order to entitle the assessee to the benefits of section is that income as computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act should include any profits and gains attributable to the business of a priority industry Accordingly we answer the question referred in the affirmative and against the department The assessee is entitled to the costs of this reference Question answered in the affirmative
