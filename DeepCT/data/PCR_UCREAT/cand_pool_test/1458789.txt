In the meanwhile the Act was repealed by Section of the Act and the assessee claim of interest from the date of payment of tax in till the date of reference was rejected by the <ORG> in view of Section i of the I Act The assessee filed a suit in the <ORG> for recovery of interest on the refunds of Income Tax and Excess Profit Tax claiming that the assessment for the year was completed the moment the assessment order dated March was passed and that the claim for interest squarely fell within Section of the Act read with and saved by Section a of the Act It was contended on behalf of the appellant plaintiff that i for purposes of Section i the assessment must be held to have been completed not when the <ORG> made the initial order of assessment but only when the assessment assumes finality in appeal ii the scheme of the Act and the provisions of the Removal of Difficulties order suggest that the expression assessment completed before the commencement of this Act in Section i should not be construed as to render the provisions of the Act relating to the payment of interest on refunds nugatory and deprive an assessee of a right vesting in him under the Act and iii the claim for interest based on Section of the Excess Profit Tax Act pre eminently survives as Section incorporates and assimilates into itself as a part of its own legislative scheme Section of the Act and the provisions so built into Section by the legislative expedient of incorporation and not merely of reference continue to be operative notwithstanding the repeal of the Act Allowing the Appeal in part HELD a An assessment would be a completed assessment within Section i if the <ORG> had passed the order of assessment prior to the coming into force of the Act The view taken by <ORG> of the <ORG> on the point must therefore be held to be correct and does not call for interference a Section of the Act which by virtue of Section of the Excess Profit Tax Act is attracted to cases of refunds of Excess Profit Taxes stipulates that notwithstanding that a reference has been made to the <ORG> the tax shall be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case provided that if the amount of assessment is reduced as a result of such reference the amount overpaid shall be refunded with such interest as the Commissioner may allow Generally speaking the broad guiding considerations with regard to institution of suits are that wherever a right not pre existing in common law is created by a statute and that statute itself provides a machinery for the enforcement of the right both the right and the remedy having been created uno flatu and a finality is intended to the result of the statutory proceedings then even in the absence of an exclusionary provision the civil courts jurisdiction is impliedly barred It appears somewhat unjust to expose the parties to a fresh round of litigation In the particular and special circumstances of this case and with a view to doing full and complete justice between the parties a sum of Rs representing the interest on the refund of the Excess Profit Taxes should be ordered to be paid to the appellants The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATACHALIAH This appeal by special leave by the legal representatives of <NAME> the unsuccessful plaintiff is directed against the Judgment and decree dated of <ORG> in First Appeal No of on its file It would appear pursuant to the order of assessment dated made by the <ORG> officer as modified by the appellate orders dated and of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and <ORG> respectively a sum of Rs was recovered from him on under threat of coercive process However the quantum of both the taxes came to be substantially reduced pursuant to the consequential orders dated made under Section of the Act and under Section read with Section of Excess Profit Tax Act respectively giving effect to the orders of <ORG> in certain references under Section of the Act Under the Act and the Excess Profit Tax Act appellant was entitled to claim interest on the refund of taxes under circumstances contemplated by Section of the Act Plaintiff assessee thereafter instituted the present suit against <ORG> for recovery of the interest under Section of the Act alleging that the assessment in the present case must be held to have been completed before the commencement of the Act according to the assessee the assessment was completed the moment the income tax officer made the order dated and that therefore the claim for interest squarely fell within Section of the Act read with and saved by Section a of the Act The defendant resisted the suit contending first that the suit was not maintainable secondly that it was statute barred and that thirdly at all events the view taken by the authorities that the matter was governed by the Section i of the Act was correct Whether this <ORG> has jurisdiction to try this suit Whether the claim of the plaintiffs in the suit is governed by the provisions of Income Tax Act The Learned Single Judge of <ORG> who tried the suit recorded findings against plaintiff assessee on issue and in his favour on issue no In my judgment the present case is governed by the provisions of the old Act In the present case the reference was pending when the present Act came into force On a reading of the provisions of Section with the Removal of Difficulties order it seems to me that the intention of the <ORG> was that in a case of assessment such as the present one the provisions of the old Act should apply therefore hold that the claim of the plaintiffs is governed by the provisions of the Income Tax Act on issue no however learned Judge held The remedy of a civil suit it seems to me is misconceived for <ORG> has no jurisdiction to substitute its discretion to grant interest in place of the discretion vested in the Commissioner Section of the Act provides that the amount over paid shall be refunded to the assessee with such interest as the Commissioner may allow Implicit in the idea of a completed assessment says learned Counsel is the element of its finality and the requirements and concomitants of the idea of a completed assessment would accordingly be satisfied only when all proceedings including those in appeal come to an end and the assessment thus assumes finality under the Act Learned Counsel referred to the scheme of the Act in this behalf and to the provisions of the Removal of Difficulties order to suggest that the expression assessment completed before the commencement of this Act in the Section i should not be so construed as to render the provisions in the Act relating to the payment of interest on refunds nugatory and deprive an assessee of a right vesting in him under the Act <NAME> learned Senior Counsel for the respondent maintained that the point raised in the appeal is no longer res integra having been the subject of an earlier definitive pronouncement of this court on the very question and that therefore the contention urged for the appellant is untenable In <NAME> case a similar question having arisen this court held that an assessment would be a completed assessment within Section i if the <ORG> had passed the order of assessment prior to the coming into force of the Act Section of the Act which by virtue of Section of the Excess Profit Tax Act is attracted to cases of refunds of Excess Profit Taxes stipulates that notwithstanding that a reference has been made to <ORG> tax shall be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case provided that if the amount of assessment is reduced as a result of such reference the amount over paid shall be refunded with such interest as the commissioner may allow the broad guiding considerations are that wherever a right not pre existing in common law is created by a statute and that statute itself provided a machinery for the enforcement of the right both the right and the remedy having been created uno flatu and a finality is intended to the result of the statutory proceedings then even in the absence of an exclusionary provision the civil courts jurisdiction is impliedly barred To what extent and on what areas and under what circumstances and conditions the civil courts jurisdiction is preserved even where there is an express clause excluding their jurisdiction are considered in <NAME> case It appears to us somewhat unjust to expose the parties to a fresh round of litigation Even if the contention of the respondent as to the non maintainability of a civil suit is upheld appellants could yet have recourse to proceedings under Article if they can satisfy <ORG> as to the delay in approaching it and seek an appropriate Mandamus to the Commissioner who would then have to reconsider the claim for interest under this head In the result while the judgment and decree under appeal in so far as they pertain to the dismissal of the suit concerning the claim of Rs is left undisturbed this appeal is however allowed in part to the extent it pertains to the claim of Rs The appellants shall be entitled to costs in proportion to their success in the suit
