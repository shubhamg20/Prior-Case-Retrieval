HEADNOTE From and even earlier ex factory prices of sugar were worked out on the basis of cost schedules prepared by expert bodies appointed for that purpose Such cost schedules were prepared on the basis of average duration and recovery the minimum price of cane the average cost of production in the various zones taxes and a fair return on the capital employed in the industry Accordingly <ORG> announced its policy of partial control under which of the output of sugar would be acquired and the balance of would be left for free sale There shall then be paid to the producer an amount there or that is for such stock of sugar as is required to be sold and such amount shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as <ORG> may by order determine having regard to the four factors set out in cls to the duty or tax if any or payable thereon and Cl to the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar The words notwithstanding anything contained in sub suggests that the amount payable to the person required to sell the stock of sugar would be with reference to the price fixed under sub The appellants filed writ petitions in <ORG> for quashing the Order and for refixation of the ex factory price for in respect of the sugar required to be sold to the <ORG> under <ORG> dismissed the writ petitions In appeal to this <ORG> it was contended by the appellants that sub section and its cl must be construed to be dealing with levy sugar only that a reasonable return under cl should be assured unitwise and that the profit on the free sale of sugar should not be taken into account in considering whether a reasonable return has been allowed on the capital employed Dismissing the appeal HELD On the construction of sub and on the evidence produced there is no case for quashing the Sugar Price Determination Order nor for refixation of the price fixed by the <ORG> under the sub section a The sub section provides two things the determination by the <ORG> of a fair price during the process of which regard shall be had to the four matters set out therein and payment to the manufacturer part of whose stock is levied an amount therefor calculated with reference to such price as <ORG> may determine The words amount therefor mean the amount to be paid to the manufacturer in respect of such quantity of stock as is required to be sold Linder an order made with reference to sub Though the payment would of course be for the stock required to be sold to <ORG> there is nothing in sub to suggest that the price to be determined is to be with respect to that part of the stock of a particular manufacturer which is required to be sold to the <ORG> A This does not however mean that <ORG> can fix any arbitrary price or on extraneous considerations or a price which does not secure a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry on the materials placed before it the <ORG> found that the price fixed with respect to the appellants ensured a reasonable return on the capital employed and that there was no necessity for its refixation Before we proceed to consider these questions it would we think be better to set out briefly the history of control over sugar production and its distribution and the method followed in the fixation by <ORG> or what has for brevity sake been named the levy price of sugar These committees worked out cost schedules and fair price to be paid to the industry but on an <ORG> basis These cost schedules were not fair as they did not take into account disparities existing from region to region in the matter of price of cane percentage of recovery and duration of the crushing season In doing so it took into consideration factors such as the dependence of the industry on an agricultural raw material the supply of which is aff ected by several imponderables weather and pests and diseases There were two criteria for fixation of ex factory prices estimated cost of production determined according to the cost schedules prepared by <ORG> in and adjusted from time to time to provide for increase in any of the elements of costs and average of prices at which sugar was sold in an area during two to three months immediately before April Accordingly <ORG> announced in August its policy of partial control under which of the output of sugar would be acquired and the balance of would be left for free sale Also the differential relating to different grades of sugar produced by the units was adjusted and a common schedule for grade was evolved There is nothing in that table which would suggest that it was confined to levy sugar Indeed Ch in which this table appears is headed Cost Structure and Price Fixation that is the ex works price In calculating the ex factory price the <ORG> took the minimum price of cane fixed by <ORG> and not the actual price paid by the manufacturer as was also done by the <ORG> in and by the Sugar Enquiry <ORG> in per quintal that being the amount considered a fair return on capital employed in the industry Under its sub section cl such an order in may require any person holding in stock any essential commodity to sell the whole or a specified part of it to the <ORG> or <ORG> or an authorised person and in such circumstances as may be specified therein Sub requires that where any person sells any essential commodity in compliance with an order made under sub cl there shall be paid to him the price therefore a where the price can consistently with the controlled price if any fixed under this section be agreed upon the a agreed price where no such agreement can be reached the price calculated with reference to the controlled price if any or where neither cl a nor cl applies the price calculated at the market price prevailing in the locality at the date of sale Payment at market price would have to be made under this sub section only when there is no agreed or controlled price the price at which the foodstuff shall be sold in the locality in compliance with an order made under sub sec When after the issue of a notification under this subsection any person sells foodstuff of the kind and in the locality specified therein in compliance with an order made with reference to sub sec cl there shall be paid to the seller as the price therefore a the agreed price consistently with the controlled price if any the price calculated with reference to the controlled price if any where no such agreement can be reached or where neither cl a nor cl applies the price calculated with reference to the average market rate as provided therein A and the question of market price can only arise where there is no controlled or fixed price or price agreed consistently with the controlled price if any The sub section lays down two conditions which must exist before it applies The first is that there must be an order made with reference to subsec cl and the second is that there is no notification under sub sec sub section suggest that the amount payable to the person required to sell his stock of sugar would be with reference to the price fixed under the subsection and not the agreed price or the market price in the absence of any controlled price under sub sec The sub section then lays down two things firstly that where a producer is required by an order with reference to sub sec to sell any kind of sugar there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore that is for such stock of sugar as is required to be sold and secondly that such amount shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as the <ORG> Government may by order determine having regard to the four factors set out in cls The words amount therefore mean the amount to be paid to the manufacturer in respect of such quantity of his stock as is required to be sold under an order made with reference to sub sec There is thus a clear distinction between the amount payable to the producer whose stock is either wholly or in part required to be sold under an order made under sub and the price of sugar to be determined by the <ORG> having regard to the minimum price of cane fixed by it the manufacturing cost of sugar the duty and tax paid or payable thereon and securing a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar In order to appreciate the meaning of cls a and it must be remembered that ever since control on sugar was imposed <ORG> had set up expert committees to work out cost schedules and fair prices Starting in the beginning with an All India cost schedule worked out on the basis of the total production of sugar the factories were later grouped together into zones or regions and different cost schedules for different zones or regions were constructed on the basis of which fair prices were worked out at which sugar was distributed and sold <ORG> in and <ORG> in had worked out the zonal cost schedules on the basis of averaged recovery and duration the minimum and not the actual price of cane the averaged conversion costs and recommended a reasonable return on the capital employed by the industry in the business of manufacturing sugar The legislature therefore incorporated the same formula in the new sub section as the basis for working out the price The purpose behind enacting the new sub section was three fold to provide an incentive to increase production of sugar encourage ex pansion of the industry to devise a means by which the cane producer could get a share in the profits of the industry through prices for his cane higher than the minimum price fixed and secure to the consumer distribution of at least a reasonable quantity of sugar at a fair price on the basis of zonal cost schedules the tax or duty applicable in the zones and must be so structured as to leave in the ultimate result to the industry a reasonable return on the capital employed by it in the business of manufacturing sugar It is clear from the reports of <ORG> that a reasonable return recommended by that body at a fixed amount of Rs per quintal which worked out in at per annum was not in respect of levy sugar only but on the whole so that even if such a return was not obtainable on levy sugar but was obtainable on the whole it would meet The requirement of cl In this conclusion we derive a two fold support firstly from the language used in cl itself viz a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar which must mean the business as a whole and not the business of manufacturing levy sugar only and secondly from the fact of the <ORG> having all along used the same phraseology while recommending Rs per quintal as an addition by way of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry The cost schedules prepared by these bodies were for determining a fair price in relation to the entire sugar produced by the industry and the return which should be granted to it on the capital employed in the industry and not with respect to that stock only required to be sold under sub sec It was urged that besides the necessity of giving to cl the same meaning as one would have to give to cls Counsel also urged that if cl were construed to mean reasonable return on tile production of the entire stock and not levy sugar only it would mean negativing the entire scheme of partial control which was intended to leave a reasonable return on that part of the stock which was required thereunder to be sold irrespective of the return obtained by sale of the rest of his stock in a free market To bring in the return on free sugar for purposes of deciding whether a return guaranteed under cl was obtainable or not from the price fixed by <ORG> would also be ushering a factor wholly extraneous to the sub section As explained ear<ORG>r the sub section provides two things a the determination by <ORG> of a fair price during the process of which regard shall be had to the four matters set out therein and payment to the manufacturer part of whose stock is levied an amount therefore calculated with reference to such price as <ORG> may determine Though the payment would of course be for the stock required to be sold to <ORG> there is nothing in the sub section to suggest that the price to be determined is to be with respect of that part of the stock of a particular manufacturer which is required to be sold to <ORG> The floor price of cane fixed by <ORG> was intended to protect the farmer from exploitation but that was found not to be an incentive enough to induce him to increase his acreage A device had to be found under which a price higher than the minimum could be paid by the manufacturer of sugar Both these and a larger production of sugar would not be possible unless there was a reasonable return which would ensure expansion which again would not be possible unless new machinery for such expansion was brought in and factories particularly in and Bihar were modernised and renovated That concept did not by any account mean the actual cost of production of every individual manufacturer The basis of a fair price would have to be built on a reasonably efficient and economic representative cross section on whose workings cost schedules would have been worked out and the price to be determined by <ORG> under sub sec business of manufacturing sugar But this does not mean that <ORG> can fix any arbitrary price or a price fixed on extraneous considerations or such that it does not secure a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry and nearly double if the additional costs claimed by the appellants were to be admissible which would raise their cost of production to Rs as realistic and in view of the changes which had taken place during the year added in all Rs We need not examine the correctness or otherwise of this addition as the Solicitor General told us that he did not challenge the correctness of this addition on the ground that the year production had come to lac tonnes an all time record and in addition thereto there was already at hand a large stock lying undisposed of resulting in the component of working capital being very much higher than that calculated by <ORG> while fixing Rs Even before us there are no adequate materials to come to any precise conclusion as to the extra burden which the appellants had actually to bear though increase in freightage during the year is admitted There is no doubt that if the sales after May which were all in free market were to be taken into account the average realised would come to much more than Rs There is therefore no doubt that taking the picture as a whole the Haryana factories got in any event a reasonable return on the capital employed of the Act we direct that the parties will bear their own costs althroughout
