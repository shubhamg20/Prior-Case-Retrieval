We understand from the judgment that the learned Judge who tried the case did not believe this explanation and we see no reason whatever to differ from him The law under which this question has to be decided is unquestionably Section of the Transfer of Property Act for the inducing the plaintiff company to advance money on the security of the property in question took place after the Act came into force But it is argued that the words gross neglect in Section of the Act must be understood in the limited sense in which they are used in the English decisions on the subject viz The framers of the Indian Act must have considered the English decisions prior to <ORG> <ORG> Ch and if they had wished to limit the application of the words gross neglect to cases where there was an element of fraud could have done so by appropriate words Here on the finding of the learned Judge in which we concur there was no bona fide inquiry for the title deeds or reasonable excuse for their non production and the <ORG> therefore will impute fraud or gross and wilful negligence which is evidence of fraud to the second defendant and will therefore postpone him to plaintiff It is argued for appellant that the circumstances of the case negative fraud on the part of the second defendant for it could not have been to his advantage that the title deeds should be out of his possession As to this it must be said that we have very little evidence as to the exact nature of the pecuniary transactions is between the second defendant and Mrs <NAME> and that little only the statements of himself and his agent Then he takes the mortgage in December and subsequently sues Mrs <NAME> on this mortgage and withdraws the suit on her selling the property to him and she conveys it to him by deed of th August Even then he does not profess to have made any inquiry about the title deeds for he says he first knew of the mortgage to the plaintiff company at the end of In support of the contention that registration is legal notice we are referred to the cases decided by <ORG> and particularly to the Full Bench decision in <NAME> Dasrat I Bom where the question was fully considered and it was declared that in Bombay the Courts had adopted the rule which prevails in America and had held that registration does amount to notice to all subsequent purchasers and mortgagees of the same property Upon the abstract question of the comparative expediency of the one rule or the other we say nothing Upon this question we are referred by the learned Counsel for the appellant to the last clause of the definition of notice in the Transfer of Property Act Section A person is said to have notice of a fact when he actually knows that fact or when but for wilful abstention from an inquiry or search which he ought to have made or gross negligence he would have known it etc No doubt the persons acting on behalf of the company did not make search in <ORG> and had they done so they would have discovered the second defendant mortgage It is further argued for the appellant that even if the plaintiff company would be entitled to priority over the second defendant by reason of his gross negligence with regard to the title deeds they themselves have been guilty of such gross negligence as to disentitle them to priority This of itself would divert persons dealing with Mrs <NAME> and having no reason to suspect her of dishonesty from inquiry as to incumbrances We have dealt with the case on the assumption that the second defendant was entitled to rely on his mortgage of It is argued for respondent that that mortgage is merged in his purchase of The conveyance says nothing about keeping alive the mortgage on the contrary it appears on the face of it to extinguish it for it conveys the property free from incumbrances and the consideration includes the amount due on the mortgage Declaration express or implied there was none We are inclined to think that these words must have reference to the time when the conveyance was executed and it is not clear that it could be said that at that time it would have been for his benefit that the mortgage should not be extinguished
