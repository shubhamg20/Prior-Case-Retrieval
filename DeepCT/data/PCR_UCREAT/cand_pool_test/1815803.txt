HEADNOTE The petitioner in this application under Article of the Constitution entered into a contract with the respondent <ORG> for construction work The arbitrator misconducted himself in allowing the claim without deciding the objection of the <ORG> The petitioner had argued that since specific issues had been framed and referred by the District Judge to the arbitrator the same had been answered by a non speaking award and there was no mistake of law apparent on the face of the record and the District Judge had erred in setting aside the award by looking into the terms of the contract which neither formed part of the award nor were appended to it While considering the objection under section of the Act the <ORG> does not act as an appellate <ORG> it can only interfere with the award if the arbitrator misconducts himself or the proceedings or if the award has been made after the issue of an order by the <ORG> superseding the arbitration or if the arbitration proceedings have become invalid under section of the Act or the award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid There was a clear finding of the arbitrator that the contract was not rendered ineffective in terms of section of the Contract Act due to the abnormal rise in prices of materials and labour It has to be born in mind that there were specific clauses which barred consideration of extra claims in the event of price escalation The award was properly set aside by the District Judge and <ORG> was right in the view it took and there was no ground to interfere The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an application under Article of the Constitution for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment and order of <ORG> dated th April In order to appreciate the points involved it is neces sary to state that the petitioner entered into a contract dated st March with respondent State of Madhya Pradesh for the construction of Rip Rap on right bund of Masonary Dam of Tawa Project Upon refusal of the Superintending Engineer to pay the claim and his refusal to refer the matter to arbitration the petitioner moved the learned District Judge under section of the Arbitration Act hereinafter called the Act for filing of the arbitration agreement and for reference of the disputes to the arbitration There was an award dated th October on all the issues referred partly allowing the petitioner claim The award was filed in <ORG> and the respondent filed objections to the award under sections and of the Act and the petitioner filed replies There were certain items for which rates were not provided but all the same work had to be done It was contended that the claim was barred by clause and it had not been made within the time It was contended further that there was only one contract and there being no separate agreement for extension of period of the contract the rate as provided in the original contract alone was permissible As there was no separate contract and no reference under clause could be made for the enhanced period beyond the period of the contract The decision of the Superintending Engineer of the <ORG> for the time being shall be final conclusive and binding on all parties to the contract upon all question relating to the meaning of the specification design drawings and instructions hereinbefore mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship or material used on the work or as to any other question claim right matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to the contract designs drawings specifications estimates instructions orders or those conditions or otherwise concerning the work of execution or failure to execute the same whether arising during the progress of the work or after the completion or abandonment thereof Provided that if the contractor is dissatisfied with the final decision of the Superintending Engineer in respect of any matter he may within days after receiving notice of such decision give notice in writing to the Superintending Engineer requiring that the matter may be referred to the arbitration and furnishing detailed particulars of the dispute or difference specifying clearly the point at issue If the work under the contract has not been completed when a dispute is referred to arbitration work shall continue during arbitration proceedings if it is reasonably possible and no payment due to contractor should be with held on account of arbitration proceedings unless it is required by the arbitrator Clause The learned single Judge as mentioned hereinbefore of <ORG> after exhaustive discussion dismissed the appeal and upheld the order Whether the contractor was entitled to extra costs of damages for the delay caused on account of shale zone <ORG> came to the findings as follows The contractor is entitled to claim extra cost due to the delay caused on account of the shale zone in foundations <ORG> considered whether the appellant was entitled to extra cost towards rise in prices of materials and labour within and beyond the contract period The arbitrator misconducted himself in allowing the claim without deciding the objection of the <ORG> There is no general liberty reserved to the courts to absolve a party from liability to perform his part of the contract merely because on account of an uncontemplated turn of events the performance of the contract may become onerous It was argued on behalf of the appellant that since specific issues were framed and referred by the District Judge to the arbitrator the same had been answered by a non speaking award there is no mistake of law apparent on the face of record and the District Judge erred in setting aside the award by looking into the terms of the contract which it was submitted neither formed part of the award nor appended to it While considering objection under section of the Act the <ORG> does not act as an appellate court it can only interfere with the award if the arbitrator misconducts himself or the proceedings or if the award has been made after the issue of an order by the <ORG> superseding the arbitration or if the arbitration proceedings have become invalid under section of the Act or the award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid It has been reiterated that the award of the arbitrator may be set aside on the ground of an error on the face thereof only when in the award or in any document incorporated with it as for instance a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reason for his decision there is found some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous There was a clear finding of the arbitrator that the contract was not rendered ineffective in terms of section of the Act due to abnormal rise in prices of material and labour The arbitrator misconducted himself in not deciding this specific objection raised by the <ORG> regarding the legality of extra claim of the appellant If rate initially quoted by the contractor became irrelevant due to subsequent price escalation it was held in that case that contractor claim for compensation for the Reliance was placed very heavily on this decision on behalf of the appellant before us It has to be borne in mind that in the instant case there are specific clauses referred to hereinbefore which barred consideration of extra claims in the event of price escalation That made all the difference In the aforesaid view of the matter we are of the opinion that <ORG> was right in the view it took and there is no ground to interfere
