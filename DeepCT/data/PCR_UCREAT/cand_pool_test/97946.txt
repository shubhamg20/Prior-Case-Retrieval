This argument ignores the expression having regard to that precedes the said words in A of the Act In arriving at the assessable profits the Income tax Officer may disallow many expenses actually incurred by the assessee and in computing his income he may include many items on notional basis In a case where an Income tax Officer takes action under A of the Act before the tax for the relevant period is assessed only the estimated tax can be deducted but there is no reason why when the tax had already been assessed before he takes action under this section There is no provision in the Income tax Act which makes the Balance Sheet final for the purpose of A of the Act or even for the assessment But nothing prevents the parties in a suitable case to establish by cogent evidence that certain items were either by mistake or by design inflated or deflated or that there were some omissions The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by certificate raises the question of the construction of the provisions of A of the Indian Incometax Act hereinafter called the Act before it was amended by the Finance Act The assessee preferred an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against the order made by the Income tax Officer under A of the Act The <ORG> referred the following question under of the Act for the decision of <ORG> Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case any larger dividend than that declared by the company could reasonably be distributed within the meaning of Section A of the Indian Income tax Act and the application of Section A of the Indian Income tax Act was in accordance with law It came to the conclusion that having regard to the smallness of the profits the order of the Income tax Officer was not justified The material part of that section reads Where the Income tax Officer is satisfied that in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends by any company up to the end of the sixth month after its accounts for that previous year are laid before the company in general meeting are less than sixty per cent of the assessable income of the company of that previous year as reduced by the amount of incometax and super tax payable by the company in respect thereof he shall unless he is satisfied that having regard to losses incurred by the company in earlier years or to the smallness of the profit made the payment of a dividend or a larger dividend than that declared would be unreasonable make with the previous approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner an order in writing that the un distributed portion of the assessable income of the company of that previous year as computed for income tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income tax and super tax payable by the company in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders as at the date of the general meeting aforesaid and thereupon the proportionate share thereof of each shareholder shall be included in the total income of such shareholder for the purpose of assessing his total income Unless there is a deficiency in the statutory percentage the Income tax Officer has no jurisdiction to take further action thereunder If that condition is complied with he shall make an order declaring that the undistributed portion of the assessable income less the said taxes shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders But before doing so a duty is cast on him to satisfy himself that having regard to the losses incurred by the company in earlier years or the smallness of the profit made the payment of a dividend or a larger dividend than that declared would be reasonable Would the satisfaction of the Income tax Officer depend only on the two circumstances namely losses and smallness of profit Can he take into consideration other relevant circumstances What does the expression profit mean Does it mean only the assessable income or does it mean commercial or accounting profits If the scope of the section is properly appreciated the answer to the said questions would be apparent The only guidance is his capacity to put himself in the position of a prudent businessman or the director of a company and his sympathetic and objective approach to the difficult problem that arises in each case This argument ignores the expression having regard to that precedes the said words losses incurred by the company in earlier years and the smallness of the profit Adverting to the argument based upon the words having regard to their Lordships observed The form of words used no doubt lends itself to the suggestion that regard should be paid only to the two matters mentioned but it appears to their Lordships that it is I A impossible to arrive at a conclusion as to reasonableness by considering the two matters mentioned isolated from other relevant factors Moreover the statute does not say having regard only to losses previously incurred by the company and to the smallness of the profits made No answer which can be said to be in any measure adequate can be given to the question of unreasonableness by considering these two matters alone With great respect we entirely agree with this view <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed thus Smallness of the profit in section A has to be adjudged in the light of commercial principles and not in the light of total receipts actual or fictional In arriving at the assessable profits the Income tax Officer may disallow many expenses actually incurred by the assessee and in computing his income he may include many items on notional basis In a case where an Income tax Officer takes action under A of the Act before the tax for the relevant period is assessed only the estimated tax can be deduct SCI ed but there is no reason why when the tax had already been assessed before he takes action under this section the estimated tax and not the real tax shall be deducted therefrom There is no provision in the Income tax Act which makes the balance sheet final for the purpose of A of the Act or even for the assessment But nothing prevents the parties in a suitable case to establish by cogent evidence that certain items were either by mistake or by design inflated or deflated or that there were some omissions Before the <ORG> there was no dispute that the actual tax assessed for the relevant year was much higher than the estimated tax shown in the balance sheet There is no evidence on the record that the real commercial profits were artificially reduced in the balance Nor is there evidence to show what part of the income assessed represents commercial profits and what part the notional income
