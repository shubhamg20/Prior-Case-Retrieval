There was no issue on estoppel that question has been raised here for the first time There is great danger in developing superficial analogies There is no provision of Indian Law for granting a decree for foreclosure in the case of pledge or mortgage of moveables There is also authority for the proposition that alienation of a religious office may be validly made in favour of a person standing in the line of succession and not disqualified by personal unfitness <NAME> <NAME> Bom This raises the question whether the custom possesses the characteristics deemed essential for the validity of a custom There is no force in the contention that the proof of the existence of the custom should have been carried back by direct evidence to when the first Regulations were passed by <ORG> if not to the year when <ORG> was established There is also no room for serious controversy as regards the certainty and continuity of the custom It is indisputable that if a custom be against reason it has no force in law but as explained in Co When however it is said that a custom is void because it is unreasonable nothing more is meant than that the unreasonable character of the alleged custom conclusively proves that the usage even though it may have existed from time immemorial must have resulted from accident or indulgence and not from any right conferred in ancient times There is no force in the contention of the respondents that because the custom contravenes the rule that a religious office is inalienable it must be pronounced to be against public policy if this argument were to prevail all customs would be unreasonable There is also no question that though probably religious offices were originally indivisible they are now deemed partible <NAME> <NAME> I Bam There is further no question that a pala has not only been deemed heritable and partible it has also been treated as devisable as is illustrated by the case of the Mister of the first defendant who obtained a pala under the testamentary devise of her father This again involves the recognition of the transferable character of a pala the exercise of thy right to make a bequest implies an assertion of the right to make a transfer inter vivos It follows consequently that the customary right to make a sale mortgage gift or lease of a pala in favour of persons within a limited circle is closely associated with and possibly developed out of the heritable devisable and partible character of a pala As regards the third question it has been argued on behalf of the mortgagors respondents that as Order of the Civil Procedure Code of applies only to mortgages of immoveable property the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree for foreclosure and in this connection reference has been made to <NAME> <NAME> I Calc There is no substance in this contention The hearing fee in this <ORG> is assessed at thirty gold mohurs I agree with the proposed order on the second ground discussed by my learned brother
