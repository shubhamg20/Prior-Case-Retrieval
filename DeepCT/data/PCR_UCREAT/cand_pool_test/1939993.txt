DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH CHANDRACHUD CJ BENCH CHANDRACHUD CJ BHAGWATI GUPTA A UNTWALIA KAILASAM CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO SC MV SC SC SC SC SC RF SC RF SC SC SC SC SC RF SC ACT Constitution of India Forty Second Amendment Act Sections and Whether the Sections are beyond the amending power of the <ORG> under Article of the Constitution and therefore void Whether the Directive Principles of <ORG> policy contained in Part IV of the Constitution can have primacy over the fundamental rights conferred by Part of the Constitution Constitution of India Articles and The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Sick Textile Undertakings Nationalisation Act and of the order dated October the constitutionality of the Constitution Thirty Ninth Amendment Act which inserted the impugned Nationalisation Act as Entry in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution the validity of Article of the Constitution and finally the constitutionality of sections and of the Constitution Forty Second Amendment Act on the ratio of the majority judgment in <NAME> case namely though by Article of the Constitution <ORG> is given the power to amend the Constitution that power cannot be exercised so as to damage the basic features of the Constitution or so as to destroy its basic structure No constituent power can conceivably go higher than the sky high power conferred by clause for it even empowers the <ORG> to repeal the provisions of this Constitution that is to say to abrogate the democracy In other words <ORG> cannot under Article expand its amending power so as to acquire for itself the right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic and essential features While clause purports to remove all limitations on the amending power clause deprives the courts of their power to call in question any amendment of the Constitution Clause of Article totally deprives the citizens of one of the most valuable modes of redress which is guaranteed by Article A Though it is the settled practice of the Supreme <ORG> not to decide academic questions and the <ORG> has consistently taken the view that it will not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied it is difficult to uphold the preliminary objection to the consideration of the question raised by the petitioners as regards the validity of sections and of the Forty second Amendment In the instant case the question raised as regards the constitutionality of sections and of the Forty Second Amendment is not an academic or a hypothetical question Further an order has been passed against the petitioners under section A of the Industries Development and Regulation Act by which the petitioners are aggrieved Here in view of the importance of the question raised and in view of the fact that the question has been raised in many a petition it is expedient in the interest of Justice to settle the true position The answer to the question whether in view of the majority decision in <NAME> it is permissible to the <ORG> to so amend the Constitution as to give a position of precedence to directive principles over the fundamental rights must necessarily depend upon whether Articles and which must now give way to laws passed in order to effectuate the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles of Directive Policy are essential features of the basic structure of the Constitution It is only if the rights conferred by these two articles are not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution that they can be allowed to be abrogated by a constitutional amendment But to destroy the guarantees given by Part III in order purportedly to achieve the goals of Part IV is plainly to subvert the Constitution by destroying its basic structure Fundamental rights occupy a unique place in the lives Therefore the rights conferred by Part III are subject to reasonable restrictions and the Constitution provides that enforcement of some of them may in stated uncommon circumstances be suspended But just as the rights conferred by Part III would be without a radar and a compass if they were not geared to an ideal in the same manner the attainment of the ideals set out in Part IV would become a pretence for tyranny if tho price to be paid for achieving that ideal is human freedoms However a large majority of laws the bulk of them can at any rate be easily justified as having been passed for the purpose of giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing some principle or the other laid down in Part IV Secondly if it be true that no law passed for the purpose of giving effect to the Directive principle in Article can damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution there was no necessity and more so the justification for providing by a Constitutional amendment that no law which is passed for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing any principle laid down in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Articles and Articles and do not confer any fanciful rights They confer rights which are elementary for the proper and effective functioning of a democracy They are universally so regarded as is evident from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights By a long series of decisions the Supreme <ORG> has held that Article forbids class legislation but it does not forbid classification Already there are disturbing trends on a part of the Indian horizon Those trends will receive strength and encouragement if laws can be passed with immunity preventing the citizens from exercising their right to move freely throughout the territory of India Article speaks of laws giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> Article which governs the interpretation of Article provides that the word <ORG> in Part III includes the <ORG> and <ORG> of India and the <ORG> and the <ORG> of each of the <ORG>s and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of <ORG> Even if a <ORG> <ORG> passes a law for the purpose of giving effect to the policy by a local authority towards securing a directive principle the law will enjoy immunity from the provisions of Articles and The distinction between the different forms of <ORG> consists in that a real democracy will endeavour to achieve its objectives through the discipline of fundamental freedoms like those conferred by Articles and If the discipline of Article is withdrawn and if immunity from the operation of that article is conferred not only on laws passed by the <ORG> but on laws passed by the <ORG> <ORG>s also the political pressures exercised by numerically large groups can tear the country asunder by leaving it to the legislature to pick and choose favoured areas and favourite classes for preferential treatment It provides expressly that no law of a particular description shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it violates Article or Article In the very nature of things it is difficult for a court to determine whether a particular law gives effect to a particular policy The power to enquire into the question whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus between the provisions of a law and a Directive Principle cannot confer upon the <ORG>s the power to sit in Judgment over the policy itself of the <ORG> Indeed if there is one topic on which all the Judges in Kesavananda Bharti were agreed it is this that the only question open to judicial review under tho unamended Article was whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus Besides there is a significant qualitative difference between the two Articles If the protection of those articles is withdrawn in respect of an uncatalogued variety of laws fundamental freedoms will become a parchment in a glass case to be viewed as a matter of historical curiosity A There is no merit in the contention that since Art There is no decision on the validity of Article A which can be looked upon as a measuring rod of the extent of the amending power A Under clauses to of Article restrictions can be imposed only if they are reasonable and then again they can be imposed in the interest of a stated class of subjects only Per <NAME> concurring Since the question in regard to the constitutional validity of the amendment made in Article did not arise in the writ petitions and the counter affidavits it was wholly academic and superfluous to decide it Now either the Nationalisation Act was really and truly a law for giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in Article clause as declared in section of the Act or it was not such a law and the legislative declaration contained in section was a colourable device If it was the former then the unamended Article would be sufficient to protect the Nationalisation Act from attack on the ground of violation of Articles and and it would be unnecessary to involve the amended Article and if it was the latter then neither the unamended nor the amended Article would have any application In these circumstances the court could not be called upon to examine the constitutionality of the amendment made in Article Moreover apart from nullifying the requirements of clause and its proviso clause has also the effect of rendering an amendment immune from challenge even if it damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution and is therefore outside the amending power of <ORG> This would undoubtedly damage the basic structure of the Constitution because there are two essential features of the basic structure which would be violated namely the limited amending power of the <ORG> and the power of judicial review with a view to examining whether any authority under the Constitution has exceeded the limits of its powers A Our Constitution is a controlled constitution which confers powers on the various authorities created and recognised by it and defines the limits of those powers The Constitution is suprema lex the paramount law of the land and there is no authority no department or branch of the <ORG> which is above or beyond the Constitution or has powers unfettered and unrestricted by the Constitution <ORG> too is a creature of the Constitution and it can only have such powers as are given to it under the Constitution It has no inherent power of amendment of the Constitution and being an authority created by the Constitution it cannot have such inherent power but the power of amendment is conferred upon it by the Constitution and it is a limited power which is so conferred Now if by constitutional amendment <ORG> was granted unlimited power of amendment it would cease to be an authority under the Constitution but would become supreme over it because it would have power to alter the entire Constitution including its basic structure and even to put an end to it by totally changing its identity Therefore the limited amending power of <ORG> is itself an essential feature of the Constitution a part of its basic structure for if the limited power of amendment was enlarged into an unlimited power the entire character of the Constitution would be changed It must follow as a necessary corollary that any amendment of the Constitution which seeks directly or indirectly to enlarge the amending power of <ORG> by freeing it from the limitation of unamendability of the basic structure would be violative of the basic structure and hence outside the amendatory power of <ORG> The Constitution has created an independent machinery namely the judiciary which is vested with the power of judicial review to determine the legality of executive action and the validity of legislation passed by the <ORG> This power of judicial review is conferred on the judiciary by Articles and of the Constitution That is the essence of the rule of law which inter alia requires that the exercise of powers by the <ORG> whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other authority be conditioned by the Constitution and the law If there is one feature of our Constitution which more than any other is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law it is the power of judicial review and it is unquestionably a part of the basic structure of the Constitution If by a constitutional amendment the power of judicial review is taken away and it is provided that the validity of any law made by the legislature shall not be liable to be called in question on any ground even if it is outside the legislative competence of the legislature or is violative of any fundamental rights it would be nothing short of subversion of the Constitution for it would make a mockery of the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the <ORG>s and render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile So also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking away the power of judicial review and providing that no amendment made in the Constitution shall be liable to be questioned on any ground even if such amendment is violative of the basic structure and therefore outside the amendatory power of <ORG> it would be making <ORG> sole judge of the constitutional validity of what it has done and that would in effect and substance nullify the limitation on the amending power of <ORG> and effect the basic constructure of the Constitution <NAME> case there was no doubt at all that the amendatory power of <ORG> was limited and it was not competent to <ORG> to alter the basic structure of the Constitution and clause could not remove the doubt which did not exist Per contra Section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act making amendments in Article and giving primacy to Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights in case of conflict between them does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and is within the amending power of <ORG> and therefore amended Article is constitutional and valid Moreover there are three Articles namely Article Article and Article within the category of Fundamental Rights which are designed to protect the individual against the action of other private citizens and seem to impose positive obligations on the <ORG> to ensure this protection to the individual There is a real connection between individual liberty and the shape and form of the social and economic structure of the society On this question Article is emphatic and make the point in no uncertain terms There could not have been more explicit language used by the Constitution makers to make the Directive Principles binding on the <ORG> and there can be no doubt that the <ORG> is under a constitutional obligation to carry out this mandate contained in Article For the purpose of the Directive Principles the <ORG> has the same meaning as given to it under Article for the purpose of the Fundamental Rights This gives rise to a paradoxical situation and its implications are far reaching The <ORG> is on the one hand prohibited by the constitutional injunction in Article from making any law or taking any executive action which would infringe any Fundamental Right and at the same time it is directed by the constitutional mandate in Article to apply the Directive Principles in the governance of the country and to make laws for giving effect to the Directive Principles When the <ORG> makes a law for giving effect to a Directive Principle it is carrying out a constitutional obligation under Article and if it were to be said that the <ORG> cannot make such a law because it comes into conflict with a Fundamental Right it can only be on the basis that Fundamental Rights stand on a higher pedestal and have precedence over Directive Principles For the purpose of determining the reasonableness of the restriction imposed on Fundamental Rights the court may legitimately take into account the Directive Principles and where executive action is taken or legislation enacted for the purpose of giving effect to a Directive Principle the restriction imposed by it on a Fundamental Right may be presumed to be reasonable vii If a law is enacted for the purpose of giving effect to a Directive Principle and it imposes a restriction on a Fundamental Right it would be difficult to condemn such restriction as unreasonable or not in public interest So also where a law is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle in furtherance of the constitutional goal of social and economic justice it may conflict with a formalistic and doctrinaire view of equality before the law but it would almost always conform to the principle of equality before the law in its total magnitude and dimension because the equality clause in the Constitution does not speak of mere formal equality before the law but embodies the concept of real and substantive equality which strikes at inequalities arising on account of vast social and economic differentials and is consequently an essential ingredient of social and economic justice The dynamic principle of egalitarianism fertilises the concept of social and economic justice it is one of its essential elements and there can be no real social and economic justice where there is a breach of the egalitarian principle If therefore there is a law enacted by the legislature which is really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle with a view to promoting social and economic justice such law does not violate the principle of egalitarianism and is in accord with the principle of equality before the law as understood not in its strict and formalistic sense but in its dynamic and activist magnitude In the circumstances the <ORG> would not be unjustified in making the presumption that a law enacted really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle in furtherance of the cause of social and economic justice would not infringe any Fundamental Right under Article or viia A law enacted really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle in discharge of the constitutional obligation laid down upon the <ORG> under Article would not be invalid because it infringes a fundamental right The two A constitutional obligations one in regard to Fundamental Rights and the other in regard to Directive Principles are of equal strength and merit and there is no reason why in case of conflict the former should be given precedence over the latter The effect of giving greater weightage to the constitutional mandate in regard to Fundamental Rights would be to relegate the Directive Principles to a secondary position and emasculate the constitutional command that the Directive Principles shall be fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to apply them in making laws The result would be that a positive mandate of the constitution commanding the <ORG> to make a law would be defeated by a negative constitutional obligation not to encroach upon a Fundamental Right and the law made by the legislature pursuant to a positive constitutional command would be delegitimised and declared unconstitutional Prior to the amendments Fundamental Rights had a superior or a higher position in the constitutional scheme than Directive Principles and there is accordingly no question at all of any subversion of the constitutional structure by the amendment The positive constitutional command to make laws for giving effect to the Directive Principles shall prevail over the negative constitutional obligation not to encroach on the Fundamental Rights embodied in Articles and ix The principle of egalitarianism is an essential element of social and economic justice and therefore where a law is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle with a view to promoting social and economic justice it would not run counter to the egalitarian principle and would not therefore be violative of the basic structure even if it infringes equality before the law in its narrow and formalistic sense No law which is really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle can be inconsistent with the egalitarian principle and therefore the protection granted to it under the amended Article against violation of Article cannot have the effect of damaging the basic structure Therefore there is no violation of the basic structure involved in the amendment of Article If the constitutional obligation in regard to the Directive Principles set out in clauses and of Article could be given precedence over the constitutional obligation in regard to the Fundamental Rights under Articles and there is no reason in principles why such precedence cannot be given to the constitutional obligation in regard to the other Directive Principles which stand on the same footing It is clear from the language of the amended Article that the law which is protected from challenge under Articles and is law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing or any of the Directive Principles Whenever therefore any protection is claimed for a law under the amended Article it is necessary for the <ORG> to examine whether the law has been enacted for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing any one or more of the Directive Principles and it is only if the court is so satisfied as a result of judicial scrutiny that the court would accord the protection of the amended Article to such law Now it is undoubtedly true that the words used in the amended Article are law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> but the policy of the <ORG> which is contemplated there is the policy towards securing one or more of the Directive Principles it is the constitutional obligation of the <ORG> to secure the Directive Principles and that is the policy which the <ORG> is required to adopt and when a law is enacted in pursuance of this policy of implementing the Directive Principles and it seeks to give effect to a Directive Principle it would both from the point of grammar and language be correct to say that it is made for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing such Directive Principle The words law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> are not so wide but in the context and collocation in which they occur they are intended to refer only to a law enacted for the purpose of implementing or giving effect to one or more of the Directive Principles To determine whether a law satisfies this test the court would have to examine the pith and substance the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope But if the court finds that the law though passed seemingly for giving effect to a Directive Principle is in pith and substance one for accomplishing an unauthorised purpose unauthorised in the sense of not being covered by any Directive Principle such law would not have the protection of the amended Article The amended Article does not give protection to a law which has merely some remote or tenuous connection with a Directive The words used in the amended Article are law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV and these words on a plain natural construction do not include all the provisions of law but only those which give effect to the Directive Principle Therefore it is not every provision of a statute which has been enacted with the dominant object of giving effect to a Directive Principle that is entitled to protection but only those provisions of the statute which are basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principles are protected under the amended Article If there are any other provisions in the statute which do not fall within this category they would not be entitled to protection and their validity would have to be judged by reference to Articles and Where therefore protection is claimed in respect of a statute under the amended Article the court would have first to determine whether there is real and substantial connection between the law and a Directive Principle and the predominant object of the law is to give effect to such Directive Principle and if the answer to this question is in the affirmative the court would then have to consider which are the provisions of the law basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principle and give protection of the amended Article only to those provisions The question whether any particular provision of the law is basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principle would depend to a large extent on how closely and integrally such provision is connected with the implementation of the Directive Principle xii If the <ORG> finds that even in a statute enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle there is a provision which is not essentially and integrally connected with the implementation of the Directive Principle or the dominant object of which is to achieve an unauthorised purpose it would be outside the protection of the amended Article and would have to meet the challenge of Articles and xiii Articles to contain Directive Principles referring to certain specific objectives and in order that a law should be for giving effect to one of those Directive Principles there would be a real and substantial connection between the law and the specific objective set out in such Directive Principle Obviously the objectives set out in these Directive Principles being specific and limited every law made by a legislature in the country cannot possibly have a real and substantial connection with one or the other of these specific objectives It is only a limited number of laws which would have a real A and substantial connection with one or the other of the specific objectives contained in these Directive Principles and any and every law would not come within this category It no doubt talks of the duty of the <ORG> to promote the welfare of the people and there can be no doubt that standing by itself this might cover a fairly wide area but the objective set out in the Article is not merely promotion of the welfare of the people but there is a further requirement that the welfare of the people is to be promoted by the <ORG> not in any manner it likes not according to its whim and fancy but for securing and protecting a particular type of social order and that social order should be such as would ensure social economic and political justice for all xv The concept of social and economic justice may not be very easy of definition but its broad contours are to be found in some of the provisions of the Fundamental Rights and in the Directive Principles and whenever a question arises whether a legislation is for giving effect to social and economic justice it is with reference to these provisions that the question would have to be determined There is nothing so vague or indefinite about the concept of social or economic justice that almost any kind of legislation could be justified under it Moreover where a claim for protection is made in respect of a legislation on the ground that it is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle the Directive Principle to which it is claimed to be related would not ordinarily be the general Directive Principle set out in Article but could be one of the specific Directive Principles set out in the succeeding Articles because these latter particularise the concept of social and economic justice referred to in Article Therefore it is not correct to say that if the amendment in Article were held valid it would have the effect of protecting every possible legislation under the sun and that would in effect and substance wipe out Articles and from the Constitution The view that Article A is constitutionally valid has been fallen in atleast three decisions of the Supreme <ORG> namely <NAME> case <NAME> case and <NAME> case and it has hold the field for over years and on the faith of its correctness millions of acres of agricultural land have changed hands and now agrarian relations have come into being transferring the entire rural economy validity of Article A was not tested in these decisions by reference to the basic structure doctrine the court would not be justified in allowing the earlier decisions to be reconsidered and the question of constitutional validity of Article A re opened followed It is no doubt true that the Supreme <ORG> has power to review its earlier decisions or even depart from them and the doctrine of stare decisions cannot be permitted to perpetuate erroneous decisions of the court to the detriment of the general welfare of the public Certainty and applicability of law would be considerably eroded and suffer a serious set back if the highest court in the land were ready to overrule the views expressed by it in earlier decisions even though that view has held the field for a number of years if one view has been taken by the court after mature deliberation the fact that another Bench is inclined to take another view would not justify the court in reconsidering the earlier decision and overrule it The power of review must be exercised with due care and caution and only for advancing the public well being and not merely because it may appear that the previous decision was based on an erroneous view of the law Articles A and were thus intended to serve the same purpose of protecting the legislation falling within a certain category Now out of the statutes which are or may in future be included in the Ninth Schedule by subsequent constitutional amendments if there are any which fall within a category covered by Article A or they would be protected from challenge under Articles and and it would not be necessary to consider whether their inclusion This question would primarily arise only in regard to statutes not covered by Article A or and in case of such statutes the <ORG> would have to consider whether the constitutional amendments including such statutes in the Ninth Schedule violate the basic structure of the Constitution in granting them immunity from challenge of the fundamental rights It would all depend on the nature of the nature of the fundamental right the extent and depth of the infringement the purpose for which the infringement is made and its impact on the basic values of the Constitution For example right to life and personal liberty enshrined in Article stands on an altogether different footing from other fundamental rights So also where a legislation which has nothing to do with agrarian reform or any Directive Principles infringes the equality clause contained in Article and such legislation is sought to be protected by a constitutional amendment by including it in the Ninth Schedule it may be possible to contend that such constitutional amendment is violative of the egalitarian principle which forms part of the basic structure Ninth Schedule its constitutional validity would have to be considered by reference to the basic structured doctrine and such constitutional amendment would be liable to be declared invalid to the extent to which it damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution by according protection against violation of any particular fundamental right Irrespective of the reasons which weighed with each one of the Judges who upheld the validity of the first part of the unamended Article the reasons for reaching the said conclusion would certainly have a bearing on the determination of the ratio decidendi of the case and the ratio decidendi would certainly be important for the decision of future cases where the validity of the first part or the unamended Article is concerned it was in so many terms determined by the majority decision in <NAME> case and that decision binds A What the first part of the unamended Article does is merely to abridge the fundamental rights in Articles and by excluding the applicability to legislation giving effect to the policy towards securing the principles specified in clauses and of Article The first part of the unamended Article is basically of the same genre as Article A with only this difference that whereas Article A protects laws relating to certain subjects the first part of the unamended Article deals with laws having certain objectives There is no qualitative difference between Article A and the first part of the unamended Article in so far as the exclusion of Articles and is concerned The fact that the provisions to the first part of the unamended Article are more comprehensive and have greater width compared to those of Article A does not make any difference in principle The first part of the unamended Article in fact stands on a more secure footing because it accords protection against infraction of Articles and to legislation enacted for giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clauses and of Article The legislature in enacting such legislation acts upon the constitutional mandate contained in Article according to which the Directive Principles are fundamental in the governance of the country and it is the duty of the <ORG> to apply those principles in making laws It is for the purpose of giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clauses and of Article in discharge of the constitutional obligation laid upon the <ORG> under Article that fundamental rights in Articles and are allowed to be abridged A constitutional amendment therefore making such a provision cannot be condemned as violative of the basic structure of the Constitution One such power is that given by Article which provides that while a proclamation of emergency is in operation <ORG> may by law extend its duration for a period not exceeding one year at a time The power of declaring an emergency is therefore a power fraught with grave consequences and it has the effect of disturbing the entire power structure under the Constitution But it is a necessary power given to <ORG> with a view to arming it adequately to meet an exceptional situation arising out of threat to the security of the country on account of war or external aggression or internal disturbance or imminent danger of any such calamity It is therefore a power which has to be exercised with the greatest care and caution and utmost responsibility A There is no bar to the judicial review of the validity of a proclamation of emergency issued by the President under Article clause If a question brought before the court is purely a political question not involving determination of any legal or constitutional right or obligation the court would not entertain it since the court is concerned only with adjudication of legal rights and liabilities So long as the question is whether an authority under the Constitution has acted within the limits of its power or exceeded it it can certainly be decided by the court The court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and when there is manifestly unauthorised exercise of power under the Constitution it is the duty of the court to intervene It would not therefore be right for the <ORG> to decline to examine whether in a given case there is any constitutional violation involved in the President issuing a proclamation of emergency under clause of Article The constitutional jurisdiction of this <ORG> does not extend further than saying whether the limits on the power conferred by the Constitution on the President have been observed or there is transgression of such limits be evaluated in order to decide whether there is a situation of grave emergency by reason of the security of the country being threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance The <ORG> cannot go into the question of correctness or adequacy of the facts and circumstances on which the satisfaction of <ORG> is based But if the satisfaction is mala fide or is based on wholly extraneous and irrelevant ground the <ORG> would have jurisdiction to examine it because in that case there would be no satisfaction of the President in regard to the matter on which he is required to be satisfied The satisfaction of the President is a condition precedent to the exercise of power under Article clause and if it can be shown that there is no satisfaction of the President at all the exercise of the power would be constitutionally invalid Additionally it may be possible for the citizen in a given case to move the court for issuing a writ of mandamus for revoking Proclamation of Emergency if he is able to show by placing clear and cogent material before the court that there is no justification at all for the continuance of the Proclamation of Emergency There would be so many facts and circumstances and such diverse considerations to be taken into account by the <ORG> <ORG> before it can be satisfied that there is no longer any grave Emergency whereby the security of India is threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance This is not a matter which is fit for judicial determination and the court would not interfere with the satisfaction of the <ORG> <ORG> in this regard unless it is clear on the material on record that there is absolutely no justification for the continuance of the Proclamation of Emergency and the Proclamation is being continued mala fide or for a collateral purpose but even if this legislative assumption were unfounded it would not make any difference to the validity of the exercise of the power so long as there was one Proclamation of Emergency in operation which authorised <ORG> to extend the duration of <ORG> under the proviso to clause of Article This provision obviously could have no application in relation to the second Proclamation of Emergency if it was void when issued The proviso would in that event have to be read as relating only to the first Proclamation of Emergency and since the Proclamation of Emergency continued until it was revoked on st March the duration of <ORG> was validly extended for a period of one year from th March and hence there was a validly constituted <ORG> on the dates when the Constitution Fortieth Amendment Act and the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act were <NAME> for the intervener <ORG> <ORG> The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> In <NAME> this Court held by a majority that though by Article <ORG> is given the power to amend the Constitution The said Committee submitted its report to <ORG> in January on the basis of which <ORG> passed an order dated October under section A of the Act of authorising Respondent to take over the management of <ORG> On the ground that its affairs were being managed in a manner highly detrimental to public interest By these petitions the petitioners challenge the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Sick Textile Undertakings NationaLisation Act and of the order dated October That raises a question regarding the validity of article of the Constitution with which we propose to deal in another batch of petitions held that the fundamental importance of the freedom of the individual has to be preserved for all times to come and that it could not be amended out of existence According to the learned Chief Justice fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution cannot be abrogated though a reasonable abridgement of those rights could be effected in public interest There is a limitation on the power of amendment by necessary implication which was apparent from a reading of the preamble and therefore according to the learned Chief Justice the expression amendment of this Constitution in Article means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of the preamble made in order to carry out the basic objectives of the Constitution There was thus an implied limitation in the amending power which precluded <ORG> from abrogating or changing the identity of the Constitution or any of its basic features as they stood then conferring power on <ORG> and the State <ORG> to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in clauses and of Article altogether abrogated the right given by Article and were for that reason unconstitutional The question which we have to determine on the basis of the majority view in <NAME> <ORG> is whether the amendments introduced by sections and of the Constitution nd Amendment Act damage the basic structure of the Constitution by destroying any of its basic features or essential elements Section of the nd Amendment which was brought into force with effect from January amended Article of the Constitution by substituting the words and figures all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV for the Words and figures the principles specified in clause or clause of Article no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article A article or article and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy Provided that where such law is made by the Legislature of a State the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent Section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act which was also brought into force with effect from January inserted sub sections and in Article which read thus No amendment of this Constitution including the provisions of Part III made or purporting to have been made under this article whether before or after the commencement of section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act shall be called in question in any court on any ground We will first take up for consideration the comparatively easier question as regards the validity of the amendments made by section of the nd Amendment Clause confers upon the <ORG> a vast and undefined power to amend the Constitution even so as to distort it out of recognition But the Constitution is a precious heritage therefore you cannot destroy its identity No constituent power can conceivably go higher than the sky high power conferred by clause for it even empowers the <ORG> to repeal the provisions of this Constitution that is to say to abrogate the democracy and substitute for it a totally antithetical form of Government In other words <ORG> cannot under Article expand its amending power so as to acquire for itself the right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic and essential features Those amendments are not only within the framework of the Constitution but they give vitality to its philosophy they afford strength and succor to its foundation struck down clause of Article A of the Constitution which abolished the forum for adjucating upon a dispute relating to the validity of an election on the ground that the particular Article which was introduced by a constitutional amendment violated the principle of free and fair elections which is an essential postulate of democracy and which in its turn is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution Clause purports to remove all limitations on the amending power while clause deprives the courts of their power to call in question any amendment of the Constitution Clause of Article totally deprives the citizens of one of the most valuable modes of redress which is guaranteed by Article If it be true as stated in clause that the <ORG> has unlimited power to amend the Constitution courts can have no jurisdiction to strike down any constitutional amendment as unconstitutional The next question which we have to consider is whether the amendment made by section of the nd Amendment to Article of the Constitution is valid By the amendment introduced by section of the nd Amendment provision is made in Article saying that no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or a bridges any of the rights conferred by Article Article or Article Whereas under the original Article the challenge was excluded only in respect of laws giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in clause or clause of Article under the amendment all laws giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV are saved from a constitutional challenge under Articles and The argument of Mr <NAME> who appears on behalf of the petitioners runs thus The amendment introduced by section of the nd Amendment destroys the harmony between Parts III and IV of the Constitution by making the fundamental rights conferred by Part III subservient to the directive principles of <ORG> Policy set out in Part IV of the Constitution In other words the mandatory ends set out in Part IV can be achieved not through totalitarian methods but only through those which are consistent with the fundamental rights conferred by Part III particularly the incorporation of Articles and and the various amendments made by Articles A and the unamended Article which were all upheld by this Court establish the width OB the amending power under Article It will thereby contravene Article rather than falling within it and will for that reason be outside the protection of Article One must proceed on the basis that there were as many cases as there were declarations sought for by the petitioners therein The learned counsel further argues The directive principles including the one contained in Article do not cover the exercise of each and every legislative power relatable to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution In support of this submission reliance is placed by the learned counsel on the decisions of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> and on Weaver Constitutional Law Edition and American Jurisprudence Reliance is also placed on certain decisions of this court to which it is unnecessary to refer because the Attorney General and the Additional Solicitor General are right that it is the settled practice of this <ORG> not to decide academic questions Similarly our <ORG> has consistently taken the view that we will not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied But we find it difficult to uphold the preliminary objection because the question raised by the petitioners as regards the constitutionality of sections and of the nd Amendment is not an academic or a hypothetical question An order has been passed against the petitioners under section A of the Industries Development and Regulation Act by which the petitioners are aggrieved Besides there are two other relevant considerations which must be taken into account while dealing with the preliminary objection In view of the importance of the question raised and in view of the fact that the question has been raised in many a petition it is expedient in the interest of Justice to settle the true position The main controversy in these petitions centres round the question whether the directive principles of <ORG> policy contained in Art IV can have primacy over the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution The competing claims of parts III and IV constitute the pivotal point of the case because Article as amended by section of the nd Amendment provides in terms that a law giving effect to any directive principle cannot be challenged as void on the ground that it violates the rights conferred by Article or Article The answer to this question must necessarily depend upon whether Articles and which must now give way to laws passed in order to effectuate the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles of directive Policy are essential features of the basic structure of the Constitution It is only if the rights conferred by these two articles are not a part of the basic structure There is no doubt that though the courts have always attached very great importance to the preservation of human liberties no less importance has been attached to some of the Directive Principles of State Policy enunciated in Part IV Indeed so many tomorrows have come and gone without a leaf turning that today there is a lurking danger that people will work out their destiny through the compelled cult of their own dirty hands But there is another competing constitutional interest which occupies an equally important place in that scheme That interest is reflected in the provisions of Part III which confer fundamental rights some on citizens as Articles and do and some on It was held therein that freedom to travel throughout the United States was a basic right under the Constitution and that the right was an unconditional personal right whose exercise may not be conditioned It was held by a majority of six Judges that any system of prior restraints of expression comes to <ORG> bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity and a party In <NAME> State of Connecticut Justice <NAME> who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> observed In the realm of religious faith and in that of political belief sharp differences arise There are limits to the exercise of these liberties It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are or even stirs people to anger There is no room under our Constitution for a more restrictive view To destroy the guarantees given by Part III in order purportedly to achieve the goals of Part IV is plainly to subvert the Constitution by destroying its basic structure Fundamental rights occupy a unique place in the lives of civilized societies and have been variously described in our Judgments as transcendental inalienable and primordial But just as the rights conferred by Part III would be without a radar and a compass if they were not geared to an ideal in the same manner the attainment of the ideals set out in Part IV would become a pretence for tyranny if the price to be paid for achieving that ideal is human freedoms Article says that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part Ill and any law made in contravention of that clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void Article begins with a non obstante clause by putting Article out of harm way It then denudes Articles and of their functional utility by providing that the rights conferred by these Articles will be no barrier against passing laws for giving effect to the principles laid down in Part IV A large majority of laws the bulk of them can at any rate be easily justified as having been passed for the purpose of giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing some principle or the other laid down in Part IV It was repeatedly impressed upon us especially by the Attorney General that Article of the Constitution is the king pin of the directive principles and no law passed in order to give effect to the principle contained therein can ever damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution Secondly if it be true that no law passed for the purpose of giving effect to the directive principle contained in Article can damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution what was the necessity and more so the justification for providing by a constitutional amendment that no law which is passed for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing any principle laid down in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Articles and The object and purpose of the amendment of Article is really to save laws which cannot be saved under Article to Articles and do not confer any fanciful rights They confer rights which are elementary for the proper and effective functioning of a democracy Already there are disturbing trends on a part of the Indian horizon Those trends will receive strength and encouragement if laws can be passed with immunity preventing the citizens from exercising their right to move freely throughout the territory of India Article speaks of laws giving effect to the policy of the State Article which governs the interpretation of Article LC provides that the word State in Part III includes the <ORG> and Parliament of India and the <ORG> and the <ORG> of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the <ORG> of India Even if a State <ORG> passes a law for the purpose of giving effect to the policy by a local authority towards securing a directive principle the law will enjoy immunity from the provisions of Articles and The distinction between the different forms of Government consists in that a real democracy will endeavour to achieve its objectives through the discipline of fundamental freedoms like those conferred by Articles and If the discipline of Article is withdrawn and if immunity from the operation of that article is conferred not only on laws passed by the <ORG> but on laws passed by the <ORG> Legislatures also the political pressures exercised by numerically large groups can tear the country asunder by leaving it to the legislature to pick and choose favoured areas and favourite classes for preferential treatment Since the amendment to Article was unquestionably made with a view to empowering the legislatures to pass laws of a particular description even if those laws violate the discipline of Articles and it seems to us impossible to hold that we should still save Article from the challenge of unconstitutionality by reading into that Article words which destroy the rationale of that Article and an intendment which is plainly contrary to its proclaimed purpose It provides expressly that no law of a particular description shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it violate Article or Article We must also mention what is perhaps not fully realised that Article speaks of laws giving effect to the Policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV In the very nature of things it is difficult for a court to determine whether a particular law gives effect to a particular policy Be it be remembered that the power to enquire into the question whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus between the provisions of a law and a directive principle cannot confer upon the courts the power to sit in judgment over the policy itself of the <ORG> Indeed if there is one topic on which all the Judges in <ORG> were agreed it is this that the only question open to judicial review under the unamended Article was whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus between the impugned law and the provisions of Article and We should have mentioned that a similar argument was advanced in regard to the amendment effected by section of the nd Amendment to Article by the addition of clauses and therein It was urged that we should so construe the word amendment in clause and the word amend in clause as to comprehend only such amendments as do not destroy the basic structure of thy Constitution Besides there is a significant qualitative difference between the two Articles We see no merit in this contention There is no decision on the validity of Article A which can be looked upon as a measuring rod of the extent of the amending power To hark back to Article A every time that a new constitutional amendment is challenged is the surest means of ensuring a drastic erosion of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III It was finally urged by the learned Attorney General that if we uphold the challenge to the validity of Article the validity or clauses to of Article will be gravely imperilled because those clauses will also then be liable to be struck down as abrogating the rights conferred by Article which are an essential feature or the Constitution Under clauses to of Article restrictions can be imposed only if they are reasonable and then again they can be imposed in the interest of a stated class of subjects only These then are our reasons for the order which we passed on May to the following effect Section of the Constitution nd Amendment Act is beyond the amending power of the <ORG> and is void since it damages the basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroys its basic structure by a total exclusion of challenge to any law on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article or Article of the Constitution if the law is for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV of the Constitution It is not necessary for the purpose of this opinion to set out the relevant provisions of the impugned legislation but it is sufficient to state that it imposed a maximum ceiling on the holding of agricultural land in the State of Maharashtra and provided for acquisition of land held in excess of the ceiling and for the distribution of such excess land to landless and other persons with a view to securing the distribution of agricultural land in a manner which would best subserve the common good of the people One was person which by its definition in section sub section included a family and family by virtue of section sub section included a Hindu Undivided Family and in the case of other persons a group or unit the members of which by custom or usage are joint in estate or possession or residence and the other was family unit which according to its definition in section A read with section meant a person and his spouse and their minor sons and minor unmarried daughters The impugned legislation created an artificial concept of a family unit for the purpose of applicability of the ceiling and provided that all lands held by each member of the family unit whether jointly or separately shall be aggregated together and by a fiction of law deemed to be held by the family unit There were also certain provisions in the impugned legislation which prohibited transfers and acquisitions of agricultural land with a view to effectuating the social policy and economic mission of the law Now plainly and unquestionably this was a piece of legislation relating to agrarian reform and was immunised against challenge under Articles and by the protective cloak of Article A but even so by way of abundant caution it was given additional protection of Article by including the Principal Act and the subsequent amending Acts in the th Schedule vide the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act and the Constitution Fortieth Amendment Act The only contention advanced on behalf of the land holders in support of the appeals was that the impugned legislation in so far as it introduced an artificial concept of a family unit and fixed ceiling on holding of land by such family unit was violative of the second proviso to cl of Article A and was not saved from invalidation by the protective armour of Article Moreover the impugned legislation being manifestly one for giving effect to the Directive Principles contained in Article clauses and it was also protected against invalidation by Article The first and principal question which therefore arose for consideration in these cases was whether Articles A and are ultra vires and void as damaging or destroying the basic structure of the Constitution we could not be ready with our judgment and hence on th May being the last working day of the Court before the summer vacation we made an order expressing our conclusion but stating that we would give our reasons later We did not express any final opinion on the constitutional validity of the amendments made in the th Schedule on or after th April but we made it clear that these amendments would be open to challenge on the ground that they or any one or more of them damage the basic or essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Nationalisation Act inter alia on the ground of infraction of Articles and and Clause but since the Nationalisation Act has been included in the th Schedule by the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act the petitioners also attacked the constitutionality of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act for it is only if they could get the Nationalisation Act out from the protective wing of Article by persuading the <ORG> to strike down the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act that they could proceed with their challenge against the constitutional validity of the Nationalisation Act Now clauses and which were introduced in Article by section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act and which were in force at the date of the filing of the writ petitions provided that no amendment of the Constitution made or purported to have been made whether before or after the commencement of that section shall be called in question in any <ORG> on any ground and barred judicial review of the validity of a constitutional amendment obviously if these two clauses were validly included in Article they would stand in the way of the petitioners challenging the constitutional validity of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act There were several grounds on which the constitutional validity of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act was impugned in the writ petitions and I shall refer to them when I deal with the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties that when the writ petitions reached hearing before us Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners requested the <ORG> to examine only one question namely whether the amendments made in Article and Article by section and SS of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act were constitutional and valid and submitted that if these constitutional amendments were held invalid then the other contentions might be examined by the <ORG> at a later date He conceded before us in the course of the arguments that he was accepting the constitutional validity of Articles A and the unamended Article and his only contention vis a vis Article was that it was the amendment made in Article which had the effect of damaging or destroying the basic structure of the Constitution and that amendment was therefore beyond the constituent power of <ORG> The learned Attorney General on behalf of <ORG> opposed this plea of Mr <NAME> and urged by way of preliminary objection that though the question of constitutional validity of clauses and of Article introduced by way of amendment by section SS of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act undoubtedly arose before the <ORG> and it was necessary for the <ORG> to pronounce upon it the other question in regard to the constitutional validity of the amendment made in Article did not arise on the writ petitions and the counter affidavits and it was wholly academic and superfluous to decide it In fact if we look at the counter affidavit filed by Mr <NAME> Deputy Secretary <ORG> in reply to the writ petitions we find that no reliance has been placed on behalf of the Government on the amended Article The case of <ORG> is and that is supported by the legislative declaration contained in section of the Nationalisation Act that this Act was enacted for giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles specified in clause of Article of the Constitution Now either the Nationalisation Act was really and truly a law for giving effect to the Directive Principle set out in Article clause as declared in section or it was not such a law and the legislative declaration contained in section was a colourable device It is difficult to see how in these circumstances the <ORG> could be called upon to examine the constitutionality of the amendment made in Article that question just did not arise for consideration and it was wholly unnecessary to decide it But I find myself in the same predicament in which the learned Chief Justice found himself in <NAME> State of Kerala no judicial conference or discussion was held nor was any draft judgment circulated which could form the basis of discussion though It was only on th May just two days before the closing of the <ORG> for the summer vacation that I was informed by the learned Chief Justice that he and the other three learned Judges who had heard this case along with me had decided If there had been a judicial conference or discussion or the draft judgment setting out the reasons for holding the impugned constitutional amendments U<NAME>ra vires and void had been circulated it would have been possible for me as a resu<NAME> of full and frank discussion or after considering the reasons given in the draft judgment either to agree with the view taken by my Lord the Chief Justice and the other three learned judges or if I was not inclined so to agree then persuade them to change their view and agree with mine It is to my mind essential that a judgment of a <ORG> should be the resu<NAME> of collective deliberation of the judges composing the <ORG> and it would in my humble opinion not be in consequence with collective decision making if one or more of the judges constituting the Bench proceed to say that they will express their individual opinion ignoring their colleagues and without discussing the reasons with them and even without circulating their draft judgment so that the colleagues have no opportunity of participating in the collective decision making process <NAME> is true that sometimes where the case involves the liberty of the citizen or the execution of a death sentence or where the time taken in preparing a reasoned judgment might pre judicially affect the winning party this <ORG> does in the larger interests of justice pronounce an order and give reasons later but these are exceptional cases where the requirements of justice induces the <ORG> to depart from the legally sanctioned course But there the court had in fact waited for about months after the conclusion of the arguments and there was clearly no urgency which required that an order should be made though reasons were not ready the delay of about months in making the order was not going to injure the interests of any party since the order was not going to dispose of the writ petition and many issues would still remain to be decided which could be dea<NAME> only after the summer vacation These were the reasons which compelled me to make my order dated th May declining to pass an unreasoned order pronouncing on the validity of the impugned constitutional amendments and stating that I would prefer to pass a final order in this case when I deliver my reasoned judgment It is obvious that the decision of the questions arising in <NAME> case is closely and integrally connected with the decision of the questions in <ORG> case and therefore logically as also from the point of view of aesthetics and practical pragmatics there should be one opinion dealing with the questions in both the cases I however propose to write a single opinion dealing with the questions arising in both cases since that is the only way in which I think I can present an integrated argument in support of my view without becoming unduly and unnecessarily repetitive The principal question that arises for consideration in these two cases is whether Article A Article read with the th Schedule as amended from time to time and particularly by the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act and the Constitution Fortieth Amendment Act Article as it stood prior to its amendment by the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act and the amended Article are constitutionally valid do they fall within the scope of the amending power of <ORG> under Article The determination of this question depends on the answer to the larger question as lo whether there are any limits on the amending power of <ORG> under Article and if so what are the limits This question came up for consideration before a Bench of Judges of this Court the largest Bench that ever sat and after a hearing which lasted for days the longest hearing that ever took place eleven judgments were delivered which are reported in <NAME> State of Kerala supra But six out of the thirteen learned Judges <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> J<NAME> accepted the contention of the petitioners that though Article conferred power to amend the Constitution there were inherent or implied limitations on the power of amendment and therefore Article did not confer power on <ORG> to amend the Constitution so as to destroy or emasculate the essential or basic elements or features of the Constitution The fundamental rights according to the view taken by these six learned Judges constituted basic or essential features of the Constitution and they could not be therefore abrogated or emasculated in the exercise of the amending power conferred by Article though a reasonable abridgment of those rights could be effected in the public interest <NAME> <NAME> found it difficult in the face of the clear words of Article to exclude from their operation Articles relating to fundamental rights and he held that the word amendment in Article must carry the same meaning whether the amendment relates to taking away or abridging Fundamental rights in Part II of the Constitution or whether it pertains to some other provision outside Part III of the Constitution The remaining six Judges took the view that there were no limitations of any kind on the power of amendment though three of them seemed willing to foresee the limitation that the entire Constitution could not be abrogated leaving behind a State without a Constitution These scholars have sought to draw support for their view from the following observation of <NAME> at page of the Report It is then argued on behalf of the petitioners that essential features of the Constitution cannot be changed as a result of amendment I have already dealt with the question as to whether the power to amend the Constitution would include within itself the power to change the basic structure or framework of the Constitution It was in the context of an argument urged on behalf of the petitioners that the essential features of the Constitution cannot be changed that this observation was made by <NAME> <NAME> clarifying that if the essential features meant the basic structure or framework of the Constitution the argument of the petitioners would be acceptable but if the essential features did not form part of the basic structure or framework and went beyond it then they would not be immune from the amendatory process But it does appear from this observation that The six Judges led by Sikri <NAME> On the one hand and <NAME> <NAME> On the other were not completely ad idem as regards the precise scope of the limitation on the amendatory power of <ORG> Since this is how the judgments in <NAME> case have been read and a common ratio extracted by a Bench of five Judges of this <ORG> it is binding upon me and hence I must proceed to decide the questions arising in these cases in the light of the principle emerging from the majority decision that Article does not confer power on <ORG> to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution It is difficult to appreciate what jurisdiction or power these nine Judges had to give a summary setting out the legal effect of the eleven judgments delivered in the case Once the judgments were delivered these nine Judges as also the remaining four became functus officio and thereafter they had no authority to cull out the ratio of the judgments or to state what on a proper analysis of the judgments was the view of the majority What was the law laid down was to be found in the judgments and that task would have to be performed by the <ORG> before whom the question would arise as to what is the law laid down in <NAME> case But quite apart from the validity of this exercise embarked upon by the nine judges it is a little difficult to understand how a proper and accurate summary could be prepared by these judges when there was not enough time after the conclusion of the arguments for an exchange of draft judgments amongst the Judges and many of them did not even have the benefit of knowing fully the views of others I may therefore make it clear that I am not relying on the statement of the majority view contained in The Summary given at the end of the judgments in <NAME> case but I am proceeding on the basis of the view taken in Smt I may also at this stage refer to an argument advanced before its on the basis of certain observations in the judgment of <NAME> that he regarded fundamental rights as not forming part of the basic structure of the Constitution and therefore according to him they could be abrogated or takes away by <ORG> by an amendment made under Article that there are certain observations in the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> at the bottom of page of the Report which seem into suggest that according to the learned Judge the fundamental rights could be abridged or taken away by an amendment under Article For example he says No serious objection is taken to repeal addition or alteration of provisions of the Constitution other than those in Part III under the power of amendment conferred by Article But if we look art the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> as a whole we do not think this view can be sustained The learned Judge stated in so many words at page of the Report that though the power of amendment is plenary and would include within itself the power to add alter or repeal the various articles including those relating lo fundamental rights it is subject to the retention or the basic structure or framework of the Constitution Therefore in every case where the question arises as to whether a particular feature of the Constitution is a part of its basic structure it would have to be determined on a consideration of various factors such as the place of the particular feature in the scheme of the Constitution its object and purpose and the consequence of its denial on the integrity of the Constitution as a fundamental instrument of country governance <NAME> case supra which came up for consideration within a short period of four years after the delivery of the Judgments in <NAME> case which introduced Article A and the argument was that clause of this newly added article was constitutionally invalid on the ground that it violated the basic structure or framework of the Constitution <NAME> <NAME> as he then was emphatically asserted that in his opinion there were four unamendable features which formed part of the basic structure namely i India is a sovereign democratic republic ii Equality of status and opportunity shall be secured to all its citizens iii The State shall have no religion of its own and all persons shall be equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to process practise and propagate religion and iv The nation shall be governed by a government of laws not of men The Preamble no doubt enumerates great concepts embodying the ideological aspirations of the people but these concepts are particularised and their essential features delineated in the various provisions of the Constitution Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioners also challenged the constitutional validity of the Constitution Fortieth Amendment He too attacked the vires of clauses and of Article since they barred at the threshold any challenge against the constitutional validity of the amendment made in Article but so far as Article A Article and the unamended Article were concerned he did not dispute their validity and as pointed out by me earlier he conceded and in fact gave cogent reasons showing that they were constitutionally valid His only attack was against the validity of the amendment made in Article by section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act Clause enacted that no amendment of the Constitution made or purporting to have been made under this Article whether before or after the commencement of section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act shall be called in question in any court on any ground while clause which begins with the words For the removal of doubts declared that there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of <ORG> to amend by way of addition variation or repeal the provisions of this Constitution under this Article I will first take up for consideration clause which seeks to throw a cloak of protection on an amendment made or purporting to have been made in the Constitution and makes it unchallengeable on any ground It protects every amendment made or purporting to have been made whether before or after the commencement of section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act But would an amendment made by any other section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act such as section be covered by this protective provision This is purely a problem of verbal semantics which arises because of slovenliness in drafting that is becoming rather common these days and I need not dwell on it for there are more important questions which arise out of the challenge to the constitutional validity of clause and they require serious consideration I will proceed on the basis that the protection sought to be given by clause extends to every amendment whatsoever and that the parenthetical words whether before or after the commencement of section SS of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act were introduced merely by way of abundant caution with a view to indicating that this protection was intended to cover even amendments made or purporting to have been made before the enactment of the constitution Forty second Amendment Act Clause provides that no amendment to the Constitution made or purporting to have been made under Article shall be called in question in any court on any ground Moreover apart from nullifying the requirement of clause and its proviso clause has also the effect of rendering an amendment immune from challenge even if it damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution and is therefore outside the amending power of <ORG> This would undoubtedly damage the basic structure of the Constitution because there are two essential features of the basic structure which would be violated namely the limited amending power of <ORG> and the power of judicial review with a view to examining whether any authority under the Constitution has exceeded the limits of its powers I shall immediately proceed to state the reasons why I think that these two features form part of the basic structure of the Constitution It is clear from the majority decision in <NAME> case that our Constitution is a controlled Constitution which confers powers on the various authorities created and recognised by it and defines the limits of those powers The Constitution is supreme lex the paramount law of the land and there is no authority no department or branch of the <ORG> which is above or beyond the Constitution or has powers unfettered and unrestricted by the Constitution <ORG> too is a creature of the Constitution and it can only have such powers as are given to it under the Constitution It has no inherent power of amendment of the Constitution and being an authority created by the Constitution it cannot have such inherent power but the power of amendment is conferred upon it by the Constitution and it is a limited power which is so conferred Now if by constitutional amendment <ORG> were granted unlimited power of amendment it would cease to be an authority under the Constitution but would become supreme over it because it would have power to alter the entire Constitution including its basic structure and even to put an end to it by totally changing its identity It will therefore be seen that the limited amending power of <ORG> is itself an essential feature of the Constitution a part of its basic structure for if the limited power of amendment were enlarged into an unlimited power the entire character of the Constitution would be changed It must follow as a necessary corollary that any amendment of the Constitution which seeks directly or indirectly to enlarge the amending power of <ORG> by freeing it from the limitation of unamendability of the basic structure would be violative of the basic structure and hence outside the amendatory power of <ORG> First the decision of the question would depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution and the laws and this would pre eminently be a matter fit to be decided by the judiciary because it is the judiciary which alone would be possessed of expertise in this field and secondly the constitutional and legal protection afforded to the citizen would become illusory So also if the legislature makes a law and a dispute arises whether in making the law the legislature has acted outside the area of its legislative competence or the law is violative of the fundamental rights or of any other provisions of the Constitution its resolution cannot for the same reasons be left to the determination of the legislature The Constitution has therefore created an independent machinery for resolving these disputes and this independent machinery is the judiciary which is vested with the power of judicial review to determine the legality of executive action and the validity of legislation passed by the legislature This power of judicial review is conferred on the judiciary by Articles anc of the Constitution That is the essence of the rule of law which inter alia requires that the exercise of powers by the Government whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other authority be conditioned by the Constitution and the law I am of the view that if there is one feature of our Constitution which more than any other is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law it is the power of judicial review and it is unquestionably to my mind part of the basic structure of the Constitution Of course when I say this I should not be taken to suggest that however effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements for judicial review cannot be made by <ORG> So also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking away the power of judicial review and providing that no amendment made in the Constitution shall be liable to be questioned on any ground even if such amendment is violative of the basic structure That takes us to clause of Article <NAME> case there was no doubt at all that the amendatory There is also another ground on which the validity of this clause can be successfully assailed A was unconstitutional and void since it had the effect of abrogating Articles and in reference to legislation falling within the categories specified in the various clauses of that Article He argued that the Fundamental Rights enshrined in Articles and were part of the basic structure of the Constitution and any constitutional amendment which had the effect of abrogating or damaging these Fundamental Rights was outside the amendatory power of <ORG> I do not think that the argument of Mr <NAME> challenging the constitutional validity of clause a of Article A is well founded There was a direct challenge levelled against the constitutionality of Article A in this case on various grounds and this challenge was rejected by a Constitution Bench of this <ORG> <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> did not accept this contention and taking the view that in the context of Article law must be taken to mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary legislative power and not amendments to the constitution made in exercise of constituent power be held that Article does not affect constitutional amendments It is true that in this case the constitutional validity of Article A was not assailed on the ground of in fraction of the basic feature since that was a doctrine which came to be evolved only in <NAME> case but the fact remains that whatever be the arguments advanced or omitted to be advanced The view taken in <NAME> case as regards the amending power of <ORG> was reversed in <NAME> case where the entire question as to the nature and extent of the constituent power of <ORG> to amend the Constitution was discussed in all its dimensions and aspects uninhibited by any previous decisions but the only constitutional amendments which were directly challenged in that case were the Twenty fourth and Twenty fifth and Twenty ninth Amendments A was not put in issue in <NAME> case and the learned Judges who decided that case were not called upon to pronounce on it and it cannot therefore be said that this <ORG> uphold the vires of Article A in that Case because he took the view that Article was merely an extension of the principle accepted in Article A and the ground which sustained the validity of clause of Article A would equally sustain the validity of the first part of Article <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> held Article to be valid and if that view be correct Article A must fortiorari be held to be valid But it must be said that there is no decision of the <ORG> in <NAME> case holding Art We have already pointed out that on merits this argument has no substance and even on an application of the basic structure doctrine But in any event I do not think that it would be proper to reopen the question of constitutional validity of Article A which has already been decided and silenced by the decisions of this <ORG> in <NAME> case <NAME> case and <NAME> case It is no doubt true that this <ORG> has power to review its earlier decisions or even depart from them and the doctrine of stare decisis cannot be permitted to perpetuate erroneous decisions of this <ORG> to the detriment of the general welfare of the public There is indeed a school of thought which believes with <NAME> that the precedents have turned upon us and they are engulfing and annihilating us engulfing and annihilating the very devotees that worshipped at their shrine and that the <ORG> should not be troubled unduly if it has to break away from precedents in order to modify old rules and if need be to fashion new ones to meet the challenges and problems thrown upon by a dynamic society But at the same time it must be borne in A mind that certainty and continuity are essential ingredients of rule of law Certainty in applicability of law would be considerably eroded and suffer a serious set back if the highest court in the land were readily to overrule the view expressed by it in earlier decisions even though that view has held the field for a number of years But when I say this let me make it clear that I do not regard the doctrine of stare decisis as a rigid and inevitable doctrine which must be applied at the cost of justice The power of review must be exercised with due care and caution and only for advancing the public well being and not merely because it may appear that the previous decision was based on an erroneous view of the law Here the view that Article A is constitutionally valid has been taken in atleast three decisions of this <ORG> namely <NAME> case <NAME> case and <NAME> case and it has held the field for over years and on the faith of its correctness millions of acres of agricultural land have changed hands and new agrarian relations have come into being transforming the entire rural economy Even though the constitutional validity of Article A was not tested in these decisions by reference to the basic structure doctrine I do not think the <ORG> would be justified in allowing the earlier decisions to be reconsidered and the question of constitutional validity of Article A A re opened Now once legislation falling within this category was protected by Art may not be sufficient to ensure the validity of a legislation which was already declared void by the courts as in <NAME> case and therefore considered it advisable to have a further provision in Article to specifically by pass judgments striking down such legislation Articles A and were thus intended to serve the same purpose of protecting legislation falling within a certain category Originally in the draft bill in addition to these clauses there was one more clause namely clause which sought to give protection to a law providing for the acquisition or requisitioning of any immovable property for the rehabilitation of displaced persons and as a corollary to the proposed amendment of Art was however left out of the th Schedule in the draft Bill because it included certain purposes of acquisition which fell outside the proposed clause of Article A It is significant to note that similar Orissa Statute which provided for acquisition of land for purposes going beyond the proposed clause of Article A and which was not amended in the same manner as the West Bengal Act was not included in the th Schedule The validity of the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act was challenged before this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and though the <ORG> by a majority of six against five took the view that <ORG> has no power to amend any fundamental right it held that this decision would not affect the validity of the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act and other earlier amendments to the Constitution and thus recognised the validity of the various constitutional amendments which included statutes in the th Schedule from time to time upto that date The validity of the Twenty Ninth Amendment Act was challenged in <NAME> case but by a majority consisting of <NAME> It may be pointed out that quite a large number of statutes have been included in the th Schedule by the subsequent constitutional amendments and strangely enough we find for the first time that statutes have been included which have no connection at all with Article A or and this device of Article which was originally adopted only as a means of giving a more definite and assured protection to legislation already protected under Article A has been utilised for the totally different purpose of excluding the applicability of Fundamental Rights to all kinds of statute which have nothing to do with agrarian reform or Directive Principles if there are any which fall within a category covered by Article A or they would be protected from challenge under Articles and and it would not be necessary to consider whether their inclusion in the th Schedule is constitutionally valid except in those rare cases where protection may be claimed for them against violation of any other fundamental rights This question would primarily arise only in regard to statutes not covered by Article A or and in case of such statutes the <ORG> would have to consider whether the constitutional amendments including such statutes in the th Schedule violate the basic structure of the Constitution in granting them immunity from challenge of the fundamental rights It would all depend on the nature of the fundamental right the extent and depth of the infringement the purpose for which the infringement is made and its impact on the basic values of the Constitution Take for example right to life and personal liberty enshrined in Article So also where a legislation which has nothing to do with agrarian reform or any Directive Principles infringes the equality clause contained in Article and such legislation is sought to be protected by a constitutional amendment by including it in the th Schedule it may be possible to contend that such constitutional amendment is violative of the egalitarian principle which forms par of the basic structure In every case therefore where a constitutional amendment includes a statute or statutes in the th Schedule its constitutional validity would have to be considered by reference to the basic structure doctrine and such constitutional amendment would be liable to be declared invalid to the extent to which it damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution by according protection against violation of any particular fundamental right no law giving effect to the policy of the state towards securing the principles specified in Cl or of Art There were thus seven out of thirteen Judges who held that the first part of the unamended Art was constitutionally valid though the reasons which prevailed with <NAME> <NAME> for taking this view were different from those which prevailed with the other six learned Judges The issue as regards the constitutional validity of the first part of the unamended Art which directly arose for consideration before the <ORG> was accordingly answered in favour of the <ORG> and the law laid down by the majority decision was that the first part of the unamended Art I agree with Mr <NAME> that the ratio decidendi of <NAME> case was that the amending power of <ORG> is limited and <ORG> cannot in exercise of the power of amendment alter the basic structure of the Constitution and the validity of every constitutional amendment has therefore to be judged by applying the test whether or not it alters the basic structure of the constitution and this test was not applied by the six learned Judges headed by <NAME> <NAME> as he then was but there my agreement ends and I cannot accept further argument of Mr <NAME> that for this reason the conclusion reached by the six learned Judges and <NAME> <NAME> as regards the constitutionality of the first part of the unamended Article has no validity The reasons for reaching this conclusion would certainly have a bearing on the determination of the ratio decidendi of the case and the ratio decidendi would certainly be important for the decision of future cases where the validity of some other constitutional amendment may come to be challenged but so far as the question of validity of the first part of the unamended Article is concerned it was in so many terms determined by the majority decision in <NAME> case and that decision must be held binding upon us What the first pari of the unamended Article does is merely to abridge the Fundamental Rights in Articles and by excluding their applicability to legislation giving effect to the policy towards securing the principles specified in clauses and of Article The first part of the unamended Article is basically of the same genre as Article A with only this difference that whereas Article A protects laws relating to certain subjects the first part of the unamended Article deals with laws having certain objectives There is no qualitative difference between Article A and the first part of the unamended Article in so far as the exclusion of Articles and is concerned The fact that the provisions to the first part of the unamended Article are more comprehensive and have greater width compared to those of Article A does not make any difference in principle It may be pointed out that the first part of the unamended Article in fact stands on a more secure footing because it accords protection against infraction of Articles and to legislation enacted for giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clauses and of Article The legislature in enacting such legislation acts upon the constitutional mandate contained in Article according to which the Directive Principles are fundamental in the governance of the country and it is the duty of the <ORG> to apply those principles in making laws lt is for the purpose of giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clause and of Art in discharge of the constitutional obligation laid upon the <ORG> under Article that Fundamental Rights in Articles and are allowed to be abridged and I fail to see how a constitutional amendment making such a provision can be condemned as violative of the basic structure of the Constitution That takes us to the next ground of challenge against the constitutional validity of the Constitution Fortieth Amendment Act in so far as it included the amending Acts of of and of in the th Schedule and the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act in so far as it introduced cls only during the operation of a Proclamation of an Emergency and in the submission of the petitioners there was no Proclamation of Emergency in operation at the time when the House of People Extension of Duration Act was passed The argument of the petitioners however was that though the first Proclamation of Emergency was validly issued by the President on account of external aggression committed by Pakistan against India the circumstances changed soon thereafter and the emergency which justified the issue of the Proclamation ceased to exist and consequently the continuance of the Proclamation was malafide and colourable and hence the Proclamation though not revoked until st March ceased in law to continue in force and could not be said to be in operation at the material date namely th February clause to issue another Proclamation of Emergency the second Proclamation of Emergency was issued by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister and since this advice was given by the Prime Minister without consulting <ORG> which alone was competent under the Government of India Transaction of Business Rules to deal with the question of issue of a Proclamation of Emergency the second Proclamation of Emergency could not be said to have been validly issued by the President and there was not threat to the security of India on account of internal disturbance which could justify the issue of a Proclamation of Emergency and the second Proclamation was issued not for a legitimate purpose sanctioned by clause of Art It is only if this question is answered in favour of the petitioners that it would become necessary to consider the question of validity of the second proclamation of Emergency The petitioners however contended that the circumstances which warranted the issue of the first Proclamation of Emergency ceased to exist and put forward various facts such as the termination of hostilities with Pakistan on th December the signing of the Simla Pact on nd June the resumption of postal and telecommunication links on th November and the conclusion of trade agreement between India and Pakistan on th November as also several statements made by the Prime Minister and other Ministers from time to time to show that the threat to the security of India on account of external aggression ceased long before and there was absolutely no justification whatsoever to continue the Proclamation and hence the continuance of the Proclamation was mala fide and in colourable exercise of power and it was liable to be declared as unconstitutional and void The whole of this Article is not relevant for our purpose but I shall set out only the material provisions thereof which have a bearing on the controversy between the parties If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists hereby the Security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbance he may by Proclamation make a declaration to that effect in respect of the whole of India or cf such part of the territory thereof as may be specified in the Proclamation A Proclamation issued under cl a may be revoked or varied by a subsequent Proclamation shall be laid before <ORG> shall cease to operate at the expiration of two months unless before the expiration of that period it has been approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament A Proclamation of Emergency declaring that the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened by war or by external aggression or by internal disturbance may be made before the actual occurrence of war or of any such aggression or disturbance if the President is satisfied the there is imminent danger thereof The power conferred on the President by this article shall include the power to issue different Proclamations on different grounds being war or external aggression or internal disturbance or imminent danger of war or external aggression or internal disturbance whether or not there is a Proclamation already issued by the President under cl and such Proclamation is in operation Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution a the satisfaction of the President mentioned in clauses and shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any Court on any ground subject to the provisions of cl neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any question on any ground regarding the validity of i a declaration made by Proclamation by the President to the effect stated in clause or ii the continued operation of such Proclamation which provides that while a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation <ORG> may by law extend its duration for a period not exceeding one year at a time which says that while a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation <ORG> shall have the power to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the <ORG> List This provision also derogates from the federal principle which forms the basis of the Constitution which confers power on the President during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency to direct that provisions relating to distribution of revenues under Arts Another drastic consequence of the Proclamation of Emergency is that provided in Article which suspends the operation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Art cl em powers the President during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency to make an order suspending the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part III and cl A introduced by the Constitution Thirty Eighth Amendment Act suspends the operation of those Fundamental Rights of which the enforcement has been suspended by the President by an order made under clause The power of declaring an emergency is therefore a power fraught with grave consequences and it has the effect of disturbing the entire power structure under the Constitution But it is a necessary power given to <ORG> with a view to arming it adequately to meet an exceptional situation arising out of threat to the security of the country on account of war or external aggression or internal disturbance or imminent danger of any such calamity It is therefore a power which has to be exercised with the greatest care and caution and utmost responsibility There were two objections put forward on behalf of the respondents against the competence of the <ORG> to examine the question of validity of a Proclamation of Emergency The other objection was that in any event by reason of clauses and of Article the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to question the satisfaction of the President leading to the issue of a Proclamation of Emergency or to entertain any question regarding the validity of the Proclamation of Emergency or its continued operation My reasons for saying so are as follows It is axiomatic that if a question brought before the court is purely a political question not involving determination of any legal or constitutional right or obligation the court would not entertain it since the court is concerned only with adjudication of legal rights and liabilities There are a large number of decisions in the United States where <ORG> has entertained actions having a political complexion because they raised constitutional issue The controversy before the court may be political in character but so long as it involves determination of a constitutional question the court cannot decline to entertain it So long as the question is whether an authority under the Constitution has acted within the limits of its power or exceeded it it can certainly be decided by the court The <ORG> is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and when there is manifestly unauthorised exercise of power under the Constitution it is the duty of the <ORG> to intervene It would not therefore be right for the <ORG> to decline to examine whether in a given case there is any constitutional violation involved in the President issuing a Proclamation of Emergency under cl I of Article But when I say this I must make It clear that the constitutional jurisdiction of this <ORG> does not extend further than saying whether the limits on the power conferred by the Constitution on the President have been observed or there is transgression of such limits There may be a wide range of situations which may arise and their political implications and consequences may have to be evaluated in order to decide whether there is a situation of grave emergency by reason of the security of the country being threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance But one thing is certain that if the satisfaction is mala fide or is based on wholly extraneous and irrelevant grounds the court would have jurisdiction to examine it because in that case there would be no satisfaction of the President in regard to the matter on which he is required to be satisfied It is true that so far there is no decision of this court taking the view that the validity of a Proclamation of Emergency can be examined by the court though within these narrow limits Undoubtedly in the subsequent decision of this Court in <NAME> State of West Bengal there are one or two observations which might seem to suggest at first blush that a Proclamation of Emergency being a political matter is de hors our ken but if one looks closely at the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> in that case it will be apparent that he does not lay down that a Proclamation of Emergency cannot be reviewed by the judiciary even on a limited ground and leaves that question open and rejects the contention of the petitioner challenging the continuance of Emergency only on the ground that the onus of establishing the continuation of Emergency and absence of any ground whatever for the subjective satisfaction of the President heavy as it is has hardly been discharged and consequently it would be an academic exercise in constitutional law to pronounce on the question of judicial reviewability of a Proclamation of Emergency There is thus no decision of this court holding that a Proclamation of Emergency is beyond the judicial ken and I am not fettered by any such decision compelling me to take a view different from the one which I have expounded in the preceding paragraph of this opinion The answer to this question depends on the interpretation of clause of Article There is no other way in which it can cease to operate It may be pointed out that this interpretation of the provision of clause of Article is supported by the decision of this Court in <NAME> <ORG> where dealing with a similar contention urged on behalf of the petitioner that the continuance of the emergency which was declared on th October was a fraud on the Constitution The petitioner urged in that case that armed aggression which justified the issue of the Proclamation of Emergency had come to an end and the continuance of the Proclamation was therefore unjustified But this contention was negatived on the ground that the Proclamation having been approved by the two Houses of Parliament within a period of two months of its issuance it could cease to have effect only if revoked by another Proclamation and that not having happened the Proclamation continued to be in force Additionally it may be possible for the citizen in a given case to move the court for issuing a writ of mandamus for revoking the Proclamation of Emergency if he is able to show by placing clear and cogent material before the court that there is no justification at all for the continuance of the Proclamation of Emergency There would be so many facts and circumstances and such diverse considerations to be taken into account by the executive Government before it can be satisfied that there is no longer any grave emergency whereby the security of India is threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance this is not a matter which is a fit subject matter for judicial determination and the court would not interfere with the satisfaction of the executive Government in this regard unless it is clear on the material on record that there is absolutely no justification for the continuance of the Proclamation of Emergency and the Proclamation is being continued mala fide or for a collateral purpose These rival contentions raised a question of construction of section of <ORG>Extension of Duration Act Of course it must be concerned that <ORG> proceeded on the assumption that both the Proclamations of Emergency were in force at the relevant date and they invested <ORG> with power to enact the Act but even if this legislative assumption were unfounded it would not make any difference to the validity of the exercise of the power so long as there was one Proclamation of Emergency in operation which authorised <ORG> to extend the duration of <ORG> wader the proviso to clause of Article This provision obviously could have no application in relation to the second Proclamation of emergency if it was void when issued The proviso would in that event have to be read as relating only to the first Proclamation of Emergency and since that Proclamation of Emergency continued until it was revoked on st March the duration of <ORG> was validly extended for a period of one year from th March and hence there was a validly constituted <ORG> on the dates when the Constitution Fortieth Amendment Act and the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act were passed by <ORG> That takes me to the challenge against the constitutional validity of the amendment made in Article This amendment substitutes the words all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV for the words the principles specified in clause or clause of Article and so amended Article provides that Notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid dow in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article or Article The amended Article gives primacy to Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights in case of conflict between them and the question is whether this amendment is in any way destructive of the basic structure of the Constitution The Resolution passed by the <ORG> in proceeded to declare that in order to end the exploitation of masses political freedom must include social and economic freedom of the starving mil lions The <ORG> Election Manifesto of also reiterated the same thesis when it said that the most vital and urgent of India problems is how to remove the curse of poverty and raise the standard of masses and for that purpose it is necessary to prevent the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of individuals and groups and to prevent vested interests inimical to society from growing If we may quote the words of <NAME> in his book Both types of rights had developed as a common demand products of the national and social revolutions of their almost inseparable intertwining Sir <NAME> who was the Constitutional Adviser to <ORG> was considerably impressed by these ideas and he suggested that the best way of giving effect to the objectives set out in the objectives Resolution was to split<ORG>up the objectives into Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Principles of State Policy the former relating to personal and political rights enforceable in Courts of Law and the latter relating to social and economic rights and other matters not so enforceable and proposed that the Chapter on Fundamental Rights may be split<ORG> up into two parts Part A dealing with the latter kind of rights under the heading Fundamental Principles of Social Policy and Part dealing with the former under the heading Fundamental Rights This position was reiterated by <NAME> when he said while presenting the Supplementary Report There were two parts of the Report one contained Fundamental Rights which were justiciable and the other part of the Report referred to Fundamental Rights which were not justiciable but were directives There are a few fundamental rights which have also a positive content and that has been There are new dimensions of the Fundamental Rights which are being opened up by this Court and the entire jurisprudence of Fundamental Rights is in a stage of resurgent evolution Moreover there are three Articles namely Art There is a real connection between individual liberty and the shape and form of the social and economic structure of the society It will thus be seen that the Directive Principles enjoy a very high place in the constitutional scheme and it is only in the framework of the socio economic structure envisaged in the Directive Principles that the Fundamental Rights are intended to operate for it is only then they can become meaningful and significant for the millions of our poor and deprived people who do not have even the bare necessities of life and who are living below the poverty level It says The provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable in any court but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to apply these principles in making laws It is necessary in order to appreciate the full implications of this Article to compare it with the corresponding provision in the Irish Constitution which as pointed out above provided to some extent the inspiration for introducing Directive Principles in the Constitution Article of the Irish Constitution provides The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Directives I have already said this before but I am emphasizing it again even at the cost of repetition because at one time a view was taken by this Court in <ORG> of Madras <NAME> that because Fundamental Rights are made enforceable in a court of law and Directive Principles are not This view was patently wrong and within a few years an opportunity was found by this Court in the Kerala Education Bill SCR to introduce a qualification by stating that Nevertheless in determining the scope and ambit of the Fundamental Rights relied on by or on behalf of any person or body the court may not entirely ignore these Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy laid down in Part IV of the Constitution but should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as possible But even this observation seemed to give greater importance to Fundamental Rights as against Directive Principles and that was primarily because the Fundamental Rights are enforceable by the Judicial process while the Directive Principles are expressly made non enforceable I am however of the opinion and on this point I agree entirely with the observation of <NAME> in his highly illuminating Lectures on the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy that Whether or not a particular mandate of the Constitution is enforceable by court has no bearing on the importance of that mandate This view is clearly supported by the opinion of Professor <NAME> who while commenting upon this point says I have always argued that if a principle is recognised as binding on the legislature then it can be correctly described as a legal rule even if there is no court that can enforce it It says that the Directive Principles are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to apply these principles in making laws There could not have been more explicit language used by the Constitution makers to make the Directive Principles binding on the <ORG> and there can be no doubt that the <ORG> is under a constitutional obligation to carry out this mandate contained in Article Now it is significant to note that for the purpose of the Directive Principles the <ORG> has the same meaning as given to it under Article for the purpose of the Fundamental Rights This gives rise to a paradoxical situation and its implications are for reaching The <ORG> is on the one hand prohibited by the constitutional injunction in Article from making any law or taking any executive action which would infringe any Fundamental Right and at the same time it is directed by the constitutional mandate in Article to apply the Directive Principles in the governance of the country and to make laws for giving effect to the Directive Principles Both are constitutional obligations of the <ORG> and the question is as to which must prevail when there is a conflict between the two When the <ORG> makes a law for giving effect to a Directive Principle it is carrying out a constitutional obligation under Article and if it were to be said that the <ORG> cannot make such a law because it comes into conflict with a Fundamental Right it can only be on the basis that Fundamental Rights stand on a higher pedestal and have precedence over Directive Principles It has been laid down in recent decisions of this <ORG> that for the purpose of determining the reasonableness of the restriction imposed on Fundamental Rights the <ORG> may legitimately take into account the Directive Principles and where executive action is taken or legislation enacted for the purpose of giving effect to a Directive Principle the restriction imposed by it on a Fundamental Right may be presumed to be reasonable It will therefore be seen that if a law is enacted for the purpose of giving effect to a Directive Principle and it imposes a restriction on a Fundamental Right it would be difficult to condemn such restriction as unreasonable or not in public interest So also where a law is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle in furtherance of the constitutional goal of social and economic justice it may conflict with a formalistic and doctrinaire view of equality before the law but it would almost always conform to the principle of equality before the law in its total magnitude and dimension because the equality clause in the Constitution does not speak of more formal equality before the law but embodies the concept of real and substantive equality which strikes at inequalities arising on account of vast social and economic differentials and is consequently an essential ingredient of social and economic justice The dynamic principle of egalitarianism fertilises the concept of social and economic justice it is one of its essential elements and there can be no real social and economic justice where there is a breach of the egalitarian principle If therefore there is a law enacted by the legislature which is really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle with a view to promoting social and economic justice In the circumstances the <ORG> would not be unjustified in making the presumption that a law enacted really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle in furtherance of the cause of social and economic justice would not infringe any Fundamental Right under Article or Dr <NAME> one of the chief architects of the Constitution also made it clear while intervening during the discussion on the Constitution First Amendment Bill in <ORG> on th May that in his view So far as the doctrine of implied powers is concerned there is ample authority in the Constitution itself namely in the Directive Principles to permit <ORG> to make legislation although it will not be specifically covered by the provisions contained in the Part on Fundamental Rights If this be the correct interpretation of the constitutional provisions as I think it is the amended Article does no more than codify the existing position under the constitutional scheme by providing immunity to a law enacted really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle so that needlessly futile and time consuming controversy whether such law contravenes Article or is eliminated constitutional obligation laid upon the <ORG> under Article be invalid because it infringes a Fundamental Right If the court takes the view that it is invalid would it not be placing Fundamental Rights above Directive Principles a position not supported at all by the history of their enactment as also by the constitutional scheme already discussed by me The two constitutional obligations one in regard to Fundamental Rights and the other in regard to Directive Principles are of equal strength and merit and there is no reason why in case or conflict The effect of giving greater weightage to the constitutional mandate in regard to Fundamental Rights would be to relegate the Directive Principles to a secondary position and emasculate the constitutional command that the Directive Principles shall be fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to apply them in making laws The result would be that a positive mandate of the Constitution commanding the <ORG> to make a law would be defeated by a negative constitutional obligation not to encroach upon a Fundamental Right and the law made by the legislature pursuant to a positive constitutional command would be delegitimised and declared unconstitutional But in my view the entire premise on which this argument of Mr <NAME> is based is fallacious because it is not correct to say and I have in the preceding portions of this opinion given cogent reasons for this view that prior to the amendments Fundamental Rights had a superior or higher position in the constitutional scheme than Directive Principles and there is accordingly no question at all of any subversion of the constitutional structure by the amendment The dynamic movement towards a certain objective necessarily means certain changes taking place that is the essence of movement There is a certain conflict in the two approaches not inherently But there is that slight difficulty and naturally when the courts of the land have to consider these matters they have to lay stress more on the Fundamental Rights than on the Directive Principles there is less and less inequality and more and more equality The positive constitutional command to make laws for giving effect to the Directive Principles shall prevail over the negative constitutional obligation not to encroach on the Fundamental Rights embodied in Articles and Fundamental Rights which are conferred and guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution undoubtedly constitute the ark of the Constitution and without them a man reach will not exceed his grasp As I look at the provisions of Parts IIl and IV I feel no doubt That the basic object of conferring freedoms on individuals is the ultimate achievement of the ideals set out in Part IV A circumspect use of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III is bound to subserve the common good but voluntary submission to restraints is a philosopher dream No law which is really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle can be inconsistent with the egalitarian principle and therefore the protection granted to it under the amended Article against violation of Article cannot have the effect of damaging the basic structure Once we accept the proposition laid down by the majority decision in <NAME> case that the unamended Article was constitutionally valid it could only be on the basis that it did not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and moreover in the order made in <NAME> case on th May this Court expressly held that the unamended Article does not damage any of the basic or essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure and if that be so it is difficult to appreciate how the amended Article can be said to be violative of the basic structure If the constitutional obligation in regard to the Directive Principles set out in clauses and of Article could be given precedence over the constitutional obligation in regard to the Fundamental Rights under Articles and there is no reason in principle why such precedence cannot be given to the constitutional obligation in regard to the other Directive Principles which stand on the same footing It would to my mind be incongruous to hold the amended Article invalid when the unamended Articles has been held to be valid by the majority decision in <NAME> case and by the order made on th May in <NAME> case Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioners however contended that there was a vital difference between Article as it stood prior to its amendment and the amended Article in as much as under the unamended Article only certain categories of laws namely those enacted for the purpose of giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clauses and of Article were protected against challenge under Articles and while the position under the amended Article was that practically every law would be immune from such challenge because it would be referable to one Directive Principle or the other and the result would be that the Fundamental Rights in Articles and would become meaningless and futile and would for all practical purposes be dead letter in the Constitution The effect of giving immunity to laws enacted for the purpose of giving effect to any one or more of the Directive Principles would according to Mr <NAME> be in reality and substance to wipe out Articles and from the Constitution and that would affect the basic structure of the Constitution Mr <NAME> also urge that the laws which were protected by the amended Article were laws for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing any one or more of the Directive Principles and every law would be comprehended within this description since it would not be competent to the court to enter into questions of policy and determine whether the policy adopted in a particular law is calculated to secure any Directive Principle as claimed by the <ORG> The use of the words law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> said Mr <NAME> introduced considerable uncertainty in the yardstick with which to decide whether a particular law falls within the description in the amended Article and widened the scope and applicability of the A amended Article so as to include almost every law claimed by the <ORG> to all within such description It is clear from the Language of the amended Article that the law which is protected from challenge under Articles and is law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of this Directive Principles Whenever therefore any protection is claimed for a law under the amended Article it is necessary for the court to examine whether this law has been enacted for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing any one or more of the Directive Principles and ii is only if the court is so satisfied as a result of judicial scrutiny that the court would accord the protection of the amended Article to such law Now it is undoubtedly true that the words used in the amended Article are law giving effect to the policy of the <NAME> but the policy of the <ORG> which is contemplated there is the policy towards securing one or more of the Directive Principles The words law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> are not sc wide as Mr <NAME> would have it but in the context and collocation in which they occur they are intended to refer only to a law enacted for the purpose on implementing or giving effect to one or more of the Directive Principles To determine whether a law satisfies this test the court would have to examine the pith and substance the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope But if the court finds that the law though passed seemingly for giving effect to a Directive Principle is in pith and substance The point I wish to emphasize is that the amended Article does not give protection to a law which has merely some remote or tenuous connection with a Directive Principle There is also one other aspect which requires to be considered before protection can be given to a law under the amended Article The words used in the amended Article are Law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV and these words on a plain natural construction do not include all the provisions on the law but only those which give effect to the Directive Principle But the question is how to identify these provisions giving effect to the Directive Principle in order to accord to them the protection of the amended Article There the question was as to what was the precise connotation of the expression la relating to a <ORG> monopoly which occurs in Article This <ORG> held that a law relating to a <ORG> monopoly cannot include all the provisions contained in such law but it must be construed to mean the law relating to the monopoly in its absolutely essential features and it is only those provisions of the law which are basically and essentially necessary for creating the <ORG> monopoly which are protected by Article This view was reiterated in several subsequent decisions of this <ORG> which include inter alia <NAME> etc but only those provisions of the statute which are basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the If there are any other provisions in the statute which do not fall within this category they would not be entitled to protection and their validity would have to be judged reference to Articles and Where therefore protection is claimed in respect of a statute under the amended Article the court would have first to determine whether there is real and substantial connection between the law and a Directive Principle and the predominant object of the law is to give effect to such Directive Principle and if the answer to this question is in the affirmative the court would then have to consider which are the provisions of the law basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principle and give protection of the amended Article only to those provisions The question whether any particular provision of the law is basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principle If the <ORG> finds that even in a statute enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle there is a provision which is not essentially and integrally connected with the implementation of the Directive Principle or the dominant object of which is to achieve an unauthorised purpose it would be outside the protection of the amended Article and would have to meet the challenge of Articles and Lastly I must consider the argument of Mr <NAME> that almost any and every law would be within the protection of the amended Article because it would be referable to some Directive Principle or the other Articles to contain Directive Principles referring to certain specific objectives and in order that a law should be for giving effect to one of those Directive Principles Obviously the objectives set out in these Directive Principles being specific and limited every law made by a legislature in the country cannot possibly have a real and substantial connection with one or the other of these specific objectives It is only a limited number of laws which would have a real and substantial connection with one or the other of specific objectives contained in these Directive Principles and any and every law would not come within this category Mr <NAME> then contended that in any event the Directive Principle contained in Article was very wide and it would cover almost any law enacted by a legislature It no doubt talks of the duty of the <ORG> to promote the welfare of the people and there can be no doubt that standing by itself this might cover a fairly wide area but it may be noted that the objective set out in the Article is not merely promotion of the welfare of the people but there is a further requirement that the welfare of the people is to be promoted by the <ORG> not in any manner it likes not according to its whim and fancy but for securing and protecting a particular type of social order and that social order should be such as would ensure social economic and political justice for all The concept of social and economic Justice may not be very easy of definition but its broad contours are to be found in some of the provisions of the Fundamental Rights and in the Directive Principles and whenever a question arises whether a legislation is for giving effect to social and economic justice it is with reference to these provisions that the question would have to be determined There is nothing so vague or indefinite about the concept of social or economic justice that almost any kind of legislation could be justified under it Moreover where a claim for protection is made in respect of a legislation on the ground that it is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle the Directive Principle to which it is claimed to be related would not ordinarily be the general Directive Principle set out in Article but would be one of the specific Directive Principles set out in the succeeding Articles because as I said before these latter particularise the concept of social and economic justice referred to in Article I hold that on the interpretation placed on the amended Article by me it does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and is within the amending power of <ORG> and I would therefore declare the amended Article to be constitutional and valid I have also given my reasons in this judgment for subscribing to the order dated th May made in <NAME> case and this judgment ill so far as it sets out those reasons will be formally pronounced by me when <NAME> case is set down on board for judgment
