It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that ss and of the imputed Act purported to validate the earlier invalid Finance Act of It was further urged that the said earlier Acts had been held invalid by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> and it would be incompetent to <ORG> to validate the said Acts in spite of the decision of a court to competent jurisdiction HELD i It was factually not correct to say that the Acts of and had been struck down as void ab initio by a court of competent jurisdiction ii An Act which suffers from the infirmity that it does riot comply with the requirements of Art Legally there is no bar to the legislature adopting either of the courses mentioned above The power to legislate includes the power to legislate The power to tax can be competently exercised by the legislature either prospectively or retrospectively and that is precisely what has done in the present case Therefore there was no substance in the argument that of the Act was invalid iv The Act of and all its provisions had received the assent of the President and so prima facie the assent of the President to the Act would help the Act to validate the provisions of The earlier Acts which were not enforceable by reason of the fact that they had not secured his assent as required by Art What in truth and in substance says is that the failure to comply with the requirements of Art does not invalidate the Finance Act in question and will not invalidate any action taken or to be taken under their respective relevant provisions and such an Act may receive he assent of the President which will make the Act effective In this context there is no scope for a retrospective deeming provision in regard to the assent of the President In the present case having regard to the legis lative background of the provision prescribed by there could be little doubt that there was no element of unreasonableness involved in the retrospective operation of cl of the proviso added by the said section to of the principal Act These orders have been passed under section of the Rajasthan Passengers and Goods Taxation Validation Ordinance Ordinance No of Aggrieved by these orders the petitioner filed appeals before respondent No but respondent No refused to entertain the said appeals unless the petitioner paid in advance the tax imposed by the orders under appeal Whilst these appeals were pending before respondent No the petitioner moved for stay in respect of the recovery of the tax assessed but the said application was rejected on the ground that there was no provision in law to The petitioner thereupon paid the amount of the taxes as assessed by the impugned orders but the payment was made under protest In order to appreciate the contention of the petitioner that the Act is invalid it is necessary to mention the legislative background of the Act This Act received the assent of the President on April was published in <ORG> on April and came into force on May Section of the principal Act authorised <ORG> to frame rules consistent with the said Act for securing the payment of tax and generally for the purposes of carrying into effect its provisions Accordingly <ORG> framed suitable rules which came into force on the st May Thereupon a notification was issued by respondent No on the th April under of the said Act and It came into force on May it directed the manner in which and the rates at which the tax shall be charged and recovered assent of the President before it was introduced in <ORG> nor did this Act receive his assent after it was passed It however did not think it necessary to finally determine the question as to whether by reason of the said infirmity the said earlier Acts were void or not because in its opinion the Act of is not merely an amending and a curative Act in that limited sense but it is really an Act which virtually re enacts the provisions of the earlier Acts which suffered from a constitutional infirmity The <ORG> examined the contentions raised by the petitioners that I Raj It appears that the petitioners had also challenged the validity of the recovery of penalty for non payment of tax and <ORG> held following its earlier decisions that the levy of any penalty in the cases before At would be illegal and therefore must be struck down In other words except for the limited relief granted in respect of the levying of the penalty the substantial contention raised by the petitioners challenging the validity of the Act has been rejected by <ORG> We made it clear to the learned Advocate General that our deci sion in the present writ petition would cover the decision of the said appeals in so far as it would relate to the validity of the provisions of the Act which are impugned before us by the present petitioner and not to that part which covered the question of penalty The respondents filed their written statement in the present proceedings and they urged that the petitioners challenge to the validity of the relevant provisions of the Act should not be sustained Let us therefore proceed to refer to the provisions of the Act enquire whether the petitioner is justified in challenging their validity The Act consists of five sections Section gives its tile amends of the principal Act deals with validation of certain lump sum payments in lieu of tax purports to validate certain sections of the Rajasthan Acts of of and of it also purports to validate the tax levied paid or payable and action taken or things done during the period between the th day of March and the date of commencement of this Act Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any Court but subject to the provisions of this Act section of the Rajasthan Finance Act Rajasthan Act of section of the Rajasthan Finance Act Rajasthan Act of and section of the Rajasthan Finance Act Rajasthan Act of shall not be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been invalid during the period between the th day of March and the date of commencement of this Act merely by reason of the fact that the Bills which were enacted as the Acts aforesaid were introduced in <ORG> without the previous sanction of the President under the proviso to Art of the Constitution and were not assented to by the President and the tax levied paid or payable the composition fee paid or payable and any action taken or things done or purporting to have been taken or done during the period aforesaid under the Rajasthan Passengers and Goods Taxation Act Rajasthan Act of as amended by the Acts aforesaid shall be deemed always to have been validly levied paid payable taken or done in accordance with law and the aforesaid enactments shall be and be deemed always to have been validly enacted notwithstanding the aforesaid defects and accordingly a no suit or other proceeding shall be instituted maintained or continued in any court for the refund of any tax or fee so paid or for any other relief on the ground of invalidity of the said sections of the Acts aforesaid and no court shall enforce any decree or order directing any such refund or relief In the first place it is not clear that <ORG> has held that the said earlier Finance Act are void ab initio in fact as we have already pointed out the said <ORG> thought it unnecessary to pronounce its considered opinion on that aspect of the matter because it held that the Act of with which it was primarily dealing in the said proceedings not merely amended or cured the earlier Finance Act but re enacted the provisions of the said Acts and so the provisions of the said Acts became operative by their own force The next question to consider is whether an Act which suffers from the infirmity that it does not comply with the requirements of Art There are two answers to this question It is unnecessary for the purpose of the present proceedings to consider when such a law becomes enforceable whether subsequent assent makes it enforceable from the date when the said law purported to come into force or whether it becomes enforceable from the date of its subsequent assent We see no substance in the argument that an Act which has not complied with the provisions of Art should be cured by obtaining the subsequent assent of the President or by passing a subsequent Act re enacting the provisions of the earlier law and securing the assent of the President to such Act is a matter which the <ORG> can decide in the circumstances of a given case Legally there is no bar to the legislature adopting either of the said two courses That takes us to the construction of section and of the Act It is well recognised that the power to legislate includes the power to Legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively and in that behalf tax legislation is no different from any other legislation But apart from this theoretical aspect of the matter the power to tax can be competently exercised by the legislature either prospectively or retrospectively and that is precisely what has done in the present case Therefore there is no substance in the argument that of the Act is invalid As the said has been drafted it appears clear that clause a of the priviso added by it to of the principal Act covers the period between last of May and the th of March whereas clause covers the period between the th March and the th March The first period had in fact been already covered by a notification validly issued on April under of principal Act and so it is not easy to understand why it was thought necessary to refer to this period by the said retrospective amendment Section consists of three parts The question which arises for our decision is whether this section is valid ln dealing with this question we must of course bear in mind the fact that the Act and all its provisions have received the assent of the President and so prima a facie the assent of the President to the Act would help the Act to validate the provisions of the earlier Acts which were not enforceable by reason of the fact that they had not secured his assent as required by Art But can the assent of the President to the Act serve the purpose of making valid What in truth and in substance says is that the failure to comply with the requirements of Art will not invalidate the Finance Act in question and will not invalidate any action taken or to be taken under their respective relevant provisions The learned Advocate General has strenuously contended before us that we should look at the substance of the matter and not decide the validity of merely because the words used in it may not be happy or appropriate We agree that questions of this character must be judged on considerations of substance and not merely of form and we have tried to read as favourably as we can while appreciating the argument of the learned Advocate General but the words used in all the three parts of are clear and unambiguous they indicate that the <ORG> thought that it was competent to it to cure by its own legislative process the infirmity resulting from the non compliance with Art When it passed the earlier Finance Act in question and it was probably advised that such a legislative declaration would be valid and effective provided it received the assent of the President and such an Act may receive the assent of the President which will make the Act effective in this context there is no scope for a retrospective deeming provision in regard to the assent of the President We have given our anxious consideration to the problem raised by the wording of and we have come to the conclusion that it would not be possible to uphold its validity But in the present case however benevolently or favourably we look at the provisions of we see no escape from the conclusion that in enacting it the <ORG> appears to have clearly assumed that it can by itself cure the infirmity resulting from the non compliance with Art and all that it has to do in such a case is to obtain the a sent of the President to its own view about its power to cure such an infirmity of the Constitution which was in force at the relevant time had provided inter alia that except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce and naturally in exercise of the power conferred on it by the said provision it enacted the provisions of and made them retrospective There is one more point which still remains to be considered We have already stated that the power to make laws involves the power to make them effective prospectively as well as retrospectively and tax laws are no exception to this rule It is true that Cases may conceivably occur where the <ORG> may have to consider the question as to whether excessive retrospective operation prescribed by a taxing statute amounts to the contravention of the citizens fundamental right and in dealing with such a question the <ORG> may have to take into account all the relevant and surrounding facts and circumstances in relation to the taxation In the present case having regard to the legislative background of the provision prescribed by there can be little doubt that there is no element of unreasonableness involved in the retrospective operation cl of the proviso added by the said section to of the principal Act If we bad held that of the Act was valid then the impositoin of the tax at the enhanced rates prescribed by he said would also have been valid but in view of the fact that we have come to the conclusion that is invalid it follows that the tax which can be legitimately and validly imposed against the petitioner for the said period must be levied under the notificaion issued on April under of the principal Act No doubt Mr <NAME> attempted to argue that in view of the fact that the said had been amended by of the Finance Act of the notification issued under the original section of the principal Act ceases to be operative As a consequence of this conclusion it follows that the petitioner is entitled to claim that the tax assessed against him in respect of his vehicles for the period between th March and the th September at the enhanced rates is invalid and that the taxing authorities concerned will have to levy the tax at the rates prescribed by the notification issued on the th April under of the principal Act as it originally stood Before we part with this petition we would like to refer briefly to two decisions of this Court to which reference was made during the course of the argument before us statute is within the competence of the <ORG> which passed its character is not necessarily changed merely by its rotrospec tive operation so as to make the said retrospective operation either unreasonable or outside its legislative competence in view of the fact that the petitioner has succeeded only partially we direct that parties should bear their own costs
