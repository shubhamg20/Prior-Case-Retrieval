On Further appeal to this Court under a of the <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> had acted with material irregularity in ignoring the guidelines laid down by this Court for interfering with the judgment and order of acquittal and convicting the appellant without referring to the conclusions correctly arrived at by the Sessions Judge and secondly the appellant was fully justified in opening fire in exercise of the right of private defence Dismissing the appeal HELD a <ORG> was fully justified in reversing the order of acquittal of the appellant which was erroneously made by the Sessions Judge on the basis of surmises and conjectures and in convicting him specially when the prosecution story that the appellant fired at the deceased without any justifiable provocation was established to the hilt by the evidence of a number of prosecution witnesses who even according to the Sessions Judge gave a true account of the occurrence I A is <ORG> in an appeal against an order of acquittal under of the Code of Criminal Procedure has full power to review at large the evidence on which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon the evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed The different pharaseology used in the judgments of this Court such as a substantial and compelling reasons good and sufficiently cogent reasons strong reasons are not intended to curtail or place any limitation on the undoubted power of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion as stated above but in doing so it should give proper consideration to such matters as i the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses ii the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he had been acquitted at his trial iii the right of the accused to the benefit of any real and reasonable doubt and iv the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing la finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses In the present case it cannot be said that <ORG> has lost sight of the principles laid down by this Court with regard to the disposal of appeals against acquittal The burden on the accused to establish the plea of self defence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution It is the prosecution which is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a mere preponderance of probability either by laying basis for that plea in cross examination of prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence evidence In the instant case however the appellant has not discharged that burden either by adducing any defence evidence or by eliciting from the prosecution witnesses the existence of facts and circumstances satisfying the requisite test of preponderance of probability entitling him to exercise the right of private defence either of person or property The appellant has also not established that it was the deceased who fired any shot at him from the revolver and it was only in self defence that he fired the shots from the gun in his possession which resulted in the death of the deceased The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The above noted three appeals the first two out of which viz Briefly stated the case as put forth by the prosecution was that <NAME> the father of the appellant who migrated to Pakistan and is now a Pakistani national owned a big farm measuring approximately acres in villages Hamid Nagar and Parbatbans within the jurisdiction of <ORG> Bilaspur District Rampur On arrival at the place of occurrence <NAME> prepared the inquest report and sent the dead body of the deceased for postmortem examination to <ORG> at Rampur where Dr <NAME> In charge of the Hospital conducted the autopsy and found the following injuries on the body of the deceased Size There is fracture of thigh bone in its lower part in injuries and After usual investigation the appellant and his aforesaid two brothers were proceeded against in the Court of Additional District Magistrate <NAME> who committed them to <ORG> to stand their trial under section and section read with section of the Indian Penal Code respectively At the said trial the prosecution examined witnesses including <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Mst Ka to the effect that he had gone on a round of his Father farm at about carrying with him his uncle double barrel bore gun that on reaching his field in Parbatbans he saw <NAME> deceased and <NAME> stealing his paddy bags that at that time <NAME> of <NAME> <NAME> alias Anis and <NAME> of village Koela were working in the vicinity of that place that seeing this he challenged <NAME> and <NAME> whereupon <NAME> fired at him from a revolver hitting him on the right thigh that he remonstrated with <NAME> who fired another shot at him which grazed past his left thigh and that finding that <NAME> was determined to kill him and there was no hope of escape he fired two or three shots from his uncle gun which he was carrying in consequence whereof <NAME> fell down and <NAME> ran away and that taking away the revolver from <NAME> hand he had reached the Police Station in the tractor driven by his brother <NAME> We have given our anxious consideration to the submissions of the counsel for the appellant but find ourselves unable to accede to the same Two inextricably linked up questions that fall for consideration in this case in view of the stand of the appellant are whether the two in juries viz in the course of the same occurrence which resulted in the death of the deceased and whether the appellant was protected by the right of private defence of person or property In regard to the first question <ORG> has after careful scrutiny of the depositions of <NAME> Dr <NAME> and Dr <NAME> Chief Medical officer Lucknow whom it examined as an expert under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure come to the conclusion that the above noted injuries were not gun shot injuries and could not be caused with revolver Exh It has rightly pointed out that there is no mention in the injury report Ex That these injuries were caused in the course of the same incident which resulted in the death of the deceased also seems to be highly improbable in view of the statement of <NAME> Investigating Officer who reached the scene of occurrence within an hour of the lodging of the report Exh This takes us to the consideration of the other crucial question viz It is true that the burden on all accused person to establish the plea of self defence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that while the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt the accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying a basis for that plea in the cross examination of prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence evidence and that it was only in self defence that he fired the shots from the gun in his possession which resulted in the death of the deceased <NAME> has in answer to a question put to him in cross examination emphatically denied that <NAME> deceased was armed with a revolver or that he fired any shot in the course of the incident which resulted in his death <ORG> in an appeal against an order of acquittal under section of the Code of Criminal Code has full power to review at large the evidence on which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon the evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed The different phraseology used in the judgments of this Court such as a substantial and compelling reasons good and sufficiently cogent reasons strong reasons are not intended to curtail or place any limitation on the undoubted power of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion as stated above but in doing so it should give proper consideration to such matters as i the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses ii the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial iii the I A A I <NAME> right of the accused to the benefit of any real and reasonable doubt and iv the slowness of an appellate Court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses We have perused the impugned judgment with care but do not think that the principles laid down by this Court in the above mentioned decisions with regard to disposal of acquittal appeals were lost sight of by <ORG> The appellant version that the injuries observed on his person by Dr <NAME> on November were the result of shots fired by the deceased from revolver Exh not having been established and the appellant having admitted that he fired two or three shots at the deceased <ORG> was fully justified in reversing the trial court order of acquittal of the appellant which was erroneously made by the Sessions Judge on the basis of surmises and conjectures and convicting him specially when the prosecution story that the appellant fired at the deceased without any justifiable provocation was established to the hilt by the evidence of a number of prosecution witnesses who even according to the Sessions Judge gave a true account of the occurrence In the result we do not find any merit in these appeals which are dismissed
