The learned Sessions Judge found the case false and complained against <NAME> under Section Criminal The first point urged by the learned vakil for the appellant is that the alleged offence was not committed in a proceeding or in relation to a proceeding before the Sessions Judge That being so the present case falls within Section and the Sessions Judge had jurisdiction to make the complaint Mr <NAME> would then seem to argue that the evidence which is relied on is not worthy of belief that if we examine the evidence we shall not find it worthy of credit It might obviously be very unfair to the appellant that we should express any opinion whatever on the point at this stage and we purposely refrain from So doing The Magistrate who hears the case will decide it and it is not for us to do the work of the Magistrate
