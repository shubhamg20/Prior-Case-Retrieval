From the pleadings of the parties and the arguments addressed before us by the learned counsel the following questions arise for our consideration The next legislation was the Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act which defines gaming in similar terms as the Bengal Act We find it difficult to accept the contention that those activities which encourage a spirit of reckless propensity for making easy gain by lot or chance which lead to the loss of the hard earned money of the undiscerning and improvident common man and thereby lower his standard of living and drive him into a chronic state of indebtedness and eventually disrupt the peace and happiness of his humble home could possibly have been intended by our Constitution makers to be raised to the status of trade commerce or intercourse and to be made the subject matter of a fundamental right guaranteed by Art Mr <NAME> who appeared for the respondent disputes the correctness of these contentions It is in this background that we have to examine the question whether horse racing is a game of chance or a game involving substantial skill Section of the Police Act defines common gaming house gaming and instruments of gaming in the following words Common gaming house means any house room tent enclosure vehicle vessel or any place whatsoever in which cards dice tables or other instruments of gaming are kept or used for the profit or gain of the person owning occupying using or keeping such house room tent enclosure vehicle vessel or place whether by way of charge for the use of instruments of gaming or of the house room tent enclosure vehicle vessel or place or otherwise howsoever and includes any house room tent enclosure vehicle vessel or place opened kept or used or permitted to be opened kept or used for the purpose of gaming Gaming Gaming does not include a lottery but includes wagering or betting except wagering or betting on a horse race when such wagering or betting takes place i on the date on which such race is to be run and ii in a place or places within the race enclosure which the authority controlling such race has with the sanction of <ORG> set apart for the purpose Section of the Police Act gives power to the Commissioner to grant warrant to enter any place which is used as a common gaming house and the arrest of persons found therein and to seize all instruments of gaming etc Section states that in order to convict any person of keeping common gaming house the proof of playing for stakes shall not be necessary Section provides for penalty for opening keeping or use of a gaming house shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees but in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be mentioned in the judgment of this Court i such imprisonment shall not be less than three months and such fine shall not be less than five hundred rupees for the first offence ii such imprisonment shall not be less than six months and such fine shall not be less than seven hundred and fifty rupees for the second offence and iii such imprisonment shall not be less than one year and such fine shall not be less than one thousand rupees for the third or any subsequent offence The above quoted Section of the Gaming Act was substituted by Section of the Act During the pendency of the appeal <ORG> has enacted the Madras Race Club Acquisition and transfer of undertakings Act The Act The said Act came into force on April We may now take up the second question for consideration This Court referred to the proceedings before the courts below in the following words The learned Magistrate who tried the case was of the opinion that the offence was proved because of the presumption since it was not successfully repelled on behalf of the present respondents In the order making the reference the learned Sessions Judge made two points He first referred to of the Act which provides that nothing done under the Act shall apply to any game of mere skill wherever played and he was of opinion on the authority of two cases decided by <ORG> and one of <ORG> that the game of Rummy was a game of skill and therefore the Act did not apply to the case The three card game which goes under different names such as flush brag etc In fact in all games in which cards are shuffled and dealt out there is an element of chance because the distribution of the cards is not according to any set pattern but is dependent upon how the cards find their place in the shuffled pack From this alone it cannot be said that Rummy is a game of chance and there is no skill involved in it Experts on racing throughout the world would bear testimony to the fact and indeed it has been so recognised by decisions that the result of a horse race on which bets are placed is not based on pure chance Besides there are trials of strength trials of speed and various other uncertainties which are perhaps no games at all certainly they are not games of chance There is a wide difference between chance and accident In Engle vs <ORG> Ariz horse racing was held to be a game of skill and not of chance on the following reasoning There is some conflict perhaps in the cases as to whether horse racing be in itself a game of chance but we think the decided weight of authority and reason is that it is not In any game there is a possibility that some oversight or unexpected incident may affect the result and if these incidents are sufficient to make a game in which it may occur one of chance there is no such thing as a game of skill <NAME> in Earl of Ellesmere <NAME> CH while dealing with the question whether there was a contract by way of wagering between the <NAME> club and the horse owners observed as under To the unsophisticated racing man if such there be I should think that nothing less like a bet can well be imagined There is nothing illegal in horse racing it is a lawful sport There is nothing illegal in betting per se There is all the difference in the world between a club sweepstakes on the result of the Derby and a sweepstakes horse race as defined in the Rules of Racing We have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the horse racing is a sport which primarily depends on the special ability acquired by training The very concept of handicap race goes to show that there is no element of chance in the regular horse racing The expression gaming in the two Acts has to be interpreted in the light of the law laid down by this Court in the two <NAME> cases wherein it has been authoritatively held that a competition which substantially depends on skill is not gambling Mr <NAME> has relied on the judgment of <ORG> in Attorney General vs <ORG> AC and the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> vs Smoker A in support of the contention that de hors Section of the Police Act and Section of the Gaming Act there is no wagering or betting by a punter with the club It is not necessary for us to go into this question If we accept the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that Section A of the Police Act and Section of the Gaming Act prohibit the holding of the horse races then two contradictory provisions had been operating in the two Acts from till The only reasonable interpretation which can be given to the two sets of provisions in the two Acts is that they apply to two different situations In order to put down this evil it is considered necessary that the offence of betting on cotton price figures and bullion price figures etc It is also considered desirable to bring the language of the provisions relating to gaming in the City Police Act in line with that in the Gaming Act and also to combine the sections relating to gaming on horse race and on other forms of gaming which are separate in the respective Acts at present We may examine the question from another angle We have therefore no hesitation in holding that Section A of the Police Act and Section of the Gaming Act are not applicable to wagering or betting on a horse race when such wagering or betting takes place within the club premises and on the date on which such race is actually run on the turf of the club WHEREAS <ORG> which is a company within the meaning of the Companies Act Central Act of is engaged in the business of running of horse races at Madras and at Uthagamandalam including the business of inter venue betting AND WHEREAS it has been brought to the notice of the Government that <ORG> of <ORG> is ridden with factions and that the affairs of the said <ORG> are not conducted properly and in particular in the interests of the race going public AND WHEREAS it has been brought to the notice of the Government that the book makers keep huge amounts of bet from records causing substantial loss of revenue to the Government AND WHEREAS the Government are satisfied that <ORG> is being mismanaged and that the interests of the race going public have been affected considerably AND WHEREAS the irregularities and malpractices in the conduct of the races and in the conduct of the affairs of <ORG> have resulted in the concentration of wealth and means of production in a few hands and to the common detriment AND WHEREAS with reference to clauses and of Article of the Constitution it is expedient to provide that the ownership and control of the material resources of <ORG> is so distributed as best to subserve the common good and that the operation of the economic system of <ORG> does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment AND WHEREAS it is necessary that the interests of the race going public should be better served AND WHEREAS a policy decision has been taken to acquire for a public purpose the undertaking of <ORG> to enable <ORG> or a Corporation or a Company wholly owned by the <ORG> to properly conduct the horse races and to carry out the other objects of the club so as to subserve the interests of the general public and in particular the race going public Sections and of the Act are reproduced hereunder It is hereby declared that this Act is for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles laid down in clauses and of Article of the Constitution According to Section the <ORG> or <ORG> company shall not be liable for the liabilities of the club prior to the date of the coming into force of the Act Sections to deal with the appointment of Commissioner of Payment and the powers of the Commissioner to make payments The Act makes elaborate provisions for distribution of the amount payable amongst creditors or the club Mr <NAME> has vehemently contended that the protection of Article of the Constitution cannot be made available to the Act as the provisions of the said Act have no nexus with the objects of Article and of the Constitution The extent and scope of judicial review of legislation where there is a declaration under Article of the Constitution which enjoins that no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such a policy shall be called in question in any <ORG> on the plea that it does not give effect to such a policy has been considered in Kesavananda Bharati On an analysis of the majority judgment therein <NAME> as he then was observed in <ORG> case that the declaration in Article does not exclude the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to determine whether the law is for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Articles and <NAME> had observed in Kesavananda Bharati that in order to decide whether a law gives effect to the police of the state towards securing the directive principles specified in Article or a <ORG> will have to examine the pith and substance the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope If a law passed ostensibly to give effect to the policy of the <ORG> is in truth and substance one for accomplishing an unauthorised object the <ORG> would be entitled to tear the veil created by the declaration and decide according to the real nature of the law There are two aspects of the functioning of the club There is no question whatsoever of the club owning or controlling the material resources of the community or in any manner contributing towards the operation of the economic system resulting in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment there is no question whatsoever of attracting the Directive Principles contained in Article and of the Constitution There is no nexus so far as the provisions of the Act are concerned with the objectives contained in Article and of the Constitution If there is mismanagement of the affairs of the club by the Directors members of the club necessary action can be taken against the club under the Companies Act which provides elaborate procedure for such a situation There is no material on the record to show that any inquiry or investigation was held by <ORG> in the affairs of the club There are no special circumstances or reasons to single out the club as a class for the purposes of the impugned Act We see no reasonable basis for classifying the race club for the purposes of acquiring and transfer of its undertaking on the ground of mismanagement We see considerable force in the contention of Mr <NAME> that the acquisition and transfer of the undertaking of the club is arbitrary There is apparent contradiction in the two stands We do not agree with the contention of Mr <NAME> that the Act is a colourable piece of legislation but at the same time we are of the view that no public purpose is being served by acquisition and transfer of the undertaking of the club by the <ORG> Since we have a truck down the Act on the ground that it violates Article of the Constitution it is not necessary for us to go into the question of its validity on the ground of Article of the Constitution We allow the writ petitions and the civil appeal
