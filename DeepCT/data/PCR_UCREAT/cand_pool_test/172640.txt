On finding that there was deliberate understatement of income he imposed a penalty of Rs On appeal the <ORG> held that the mere fact that the amounts were agreed to be taken into account by the assessee did not ipsofacto indicate any criminality in its action to conceal any portion of the income and that the assessee could very well have argued against the additions of the two sums namely Rs and Rs As regards the sum of Rs it found that the assessee had agreed to similar addition in the earlier years and so the penalty was war ranted in similar amount for this year and taking into consideration that the sum involved was Rs it con sidered that a smaller penalty of Rs was imposable Allowing the appeal HELD In an income tax reference a finding on a question of pure fact could be reviewed by <ORG> only on the ground that there was no evidence to support it or that it was perverse If <ORG> found that there was no such evidence those circumstances would give rise to question of law and could be agitated in a reference Where an ultimate finding on an issue is an inference to be drawn from the facts found on the application of any principles of law there would be a mixed question of law and fact and the inference from the facts found in such a case would be a question of law It took into account all the relevant facts in a proper light in rendering a finding of fact jurisdiction under the Income Tax Reference in answering the question of law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is from the judgment and order of <ORG> dated rd December in the Income Tax Reference On th March the Income Tax Officer issued notice under section read with section of the Income Tax Act hereinafter called the Act in respect of the assessment year for imposing penalty After considering the reply the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner on st October imposed a penalty of Rs under section read with section of the Act holding inter alia that there was concealment of income to the tune of Rs and the maximum penalty of Rs was imposable in law but a sum of Rs was imposed as penalty considering the facts and circumstances of the case The assessee preferred an appeal against the said order Whether there is any material to warrant the finding that the assessee company had concealed the particulars of its income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof within the meaning of section of the Income Tax Act and There is no dispute about that question too in so far as there is no appeal by the revenue The assessee has come up in appeal to this Court challenging the correctness of that answer The salary bill was thereby inflated by Rs The Inspecting Assistant Commissioner therefore held that the assessee had concealed income to the extent of Rs He had also come to the conclusion that the cane purchases noted against these last entries were false and fictitious and the quantity covered by these entries was Mds It was also borne out by records that the amounts were not included in the return by the company He therefore found that the tax sought to be evaded came to Rs and the maxi mum penalty worked out to Rs In fact he had gone to the extent of and stated as to what staff was maintained in that centre there was a man in charge of the centre a weighment clerk a cane clerk and three to four chowkidars So far as this question was answered in favour of the assessee and there is no challenge by the revenue it is not material any more It was urged before us that as the second question which was in general form has been answered in favour of the assessee the third question as reframed could not have been answered otherwise As evident from the discussion by <ORG> <ORG> confined to second question with regard to disallowance in respect of purchase of cane that amounted to Rs So therefore it cannot be said that in view of the answer given to the second question the third question was no longer open The second question was confined to only Rs So far as whether there was justification for the answer given to the reframed third question or was proper or not has to be judged on the basis as to how far <ORG> in a reference could interfere with a finding of fact and transform the same into a question of law on the ground that there has been non consideration of all relevant facts Where an ultimate finding on an issue was an inference to be drawn from the facts found on the application of any principles of law there would be a mixed question of law and fact and the inference from the facts found was in such a case a question of law In the instant case there is a finding of fact and unless it could be said that all the relevant facts had not been considered in a proper light no question of law arises At least in the background of the law as it stood at the rele vant time that was the position It was necessary however that every fact for and against the assessee must have been considered with due care and the <ORG> must have given its finding in a manner which would clearly indicate what were the questions which arose for determination what was the evidence pro and contra in regard to each one of them and what were the findings reached on the evidence on record before it The conclusions reached by the <ORG> should not be coloured by any irrelevant considerations or matters of prejudice and if there were any circumstances which required to be ex plained by the assessee the assessee should be given an opportunity of doing so The <ORG> must in deciding an appeal consider with due care all the material facts and record its findings on all contentions raised by the asses see and the Commissioner in the light of the evidence and the relevant law If <ORG> found that there was no such evidence to support the finding of fact of the <ORG> those circumstances would give rise to a question of law and could be agitated in a reference The appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of <ORG> in so far as answer to the question No is concerned is set aside The assessee is entitled to the costs of this appeal
