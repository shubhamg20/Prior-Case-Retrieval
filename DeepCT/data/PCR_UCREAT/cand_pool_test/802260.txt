This appeal was brought by special leave from a judgment of <ORG> at Allahabad which reversed an order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Judge of Cawnpore I have considered seriously whether I should not proceed against some of the witnesses for perjury but on the whole as they have already been victims of much cruelty I think it would be unreasonable to take any action against them On the hearing before <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the present appellants that on an appeal from an order of acquittal on a matter of fact it is not open to the appellate Court to interfere with the findings of fact of the trial Judge unless it can be said that those findings could not have been reached by him had it not been for some perversity or incompetence on his part Section provides that no appeal shall lie from a judgment or order of a criminal Court except as provided for by the Code or other law Section gives the right to appeal to <ORG> to any one convicted on a trial held by a Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge The code contains certain provisions for the summary dismissal of appeals and Section provides that if the appellate Court does not dismiss the appeal summarily proper notices of the time and place of hearing shall be given to the appellant and the other parties to the appeal After perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his pleader if he appears and the Public Prosecutor if he appears and in case of an appeal under Section the accused if he appears the <ORG> may if it considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering dismiss the appeal or may a in an appeal from an order of acquittal reverse such order and direct that further enquiry be made or that the accused be retried or committed for trial as the case may be or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according to law in an appeal from a conviction reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be retried by a Court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such <ORG> or committed for trial or alter the finding maintaining the sentence or with or without altering the finding reduce the sentence or with or without such reduction and with or without altering the finding alter the nature of the sentence but subject to the provisions of Section Sub section not so as to enhance the same in an appeal from any other order alter or reverse such order make any amendment or any consequential or incidental order that may be just or proper It will be observed that upon the express terms of the Code an appeal lies from any order of acquittal passed by any <ORG> other than <ORG> such an appeal the trial not being by jury will lie upon a matter of fact on such an appeal the <ORG> may reverse the order of acquittal find the accused guilty and pass sentence on him There is no indication in the Code of any limitation or restriction on the High <ORG> in the exercise of its powers as an appellate tribunal Further it is to be observed that no distinction is drawn as regards the powers of the High <ORG> in dealing with an appeal between an appeal from an order of acquittal and an appeal from a conviction Many authorities were cited to their Lordships which undoubtedly reveal differences of views as to the powers of <ORG> in dealing with an appeal from an order of acquittal on a matter of fact There is in their opinion no foundation for the view apparently supported by the judgments of some Courts in India that <ORG> has no power or jurisdiction to reverse an order of acquittal on a matter of fact except in cases in which <ORG> has obstinately blundered or has through incompetence stupidity or perversity reached such distorted conclusions as to produce a positive miscarriage of justice or has in some other way so conducted or misconducted itself as to produce a glaring miscarriage of justice or has been tricked by the defence so as to produce a similar result Sections and of the Code give to <ORG> full power to review at large the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed But in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusions upon fact <ORG> should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of an appellate Court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses Their Lordships only desire to add that while the judgment of <ORG> does not state in express terms that these principles have been acted upon they have no reason to think that <ORG> failed to take all proper matters into consideration in arriving at their conclusions of fact In the result this appeal should be dismissed and their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly
