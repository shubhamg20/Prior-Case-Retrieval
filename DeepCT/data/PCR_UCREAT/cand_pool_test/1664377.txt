Dealing first with the question whether the plaintiff was represented in the former suit No of and the execution proceedings which followed on the decree in that suit I find no difficulty in accepting the District Judge conclusion on that point I find no reason to suppose that the plaintiff was not duly represented throughout the execution proceedings It is urged that the sale was in contravention of the provisions of Section of the Transfer of Property Act since amended and incorporated in the Civil Procedure Code and by this illegality the mortgagee who brought about the sale gained an advantage in derogation of the rights of the mortgagor and so became constructively a trustee for him It is clear to me that Section has no application The sale was on a decree for sale inartistically drawn no doubt but clearly a decree for sale made in a suit for sale on a mortgage on the land sold and there can so far as I can see be no objection to it under Section Then it is said that the mortgagee failed to bring into his suit for sale two prior mortgages one in his own favour and the other assigned to him before the sale and having failed to bring them into the suit he notified them as reserved in the proclamation of sale and so deterred investors from competing with him for the acquisition of the equity of redemption Thus he gained an advantage in derogation of the right of the mortgagor The mortgagor has a right to a reasonable time for redemption that he has had he has no right to require that prior mortgages should not be disclosed in the proclamation of sale if he had any objection on that ground either to the decree or to the sale he could have made his objection before the sale and not now years after it So far as we know he did not then suggest that there was any illegality in the mortgagee proceedings if he did he failed to convince this Court that he had any grievance Nor can it be said that there was any such illegality however convenient it may be to require a mortgagee to bring in all his mortgages in his suit for sale on one of them the weight of authority in this Presidency seems to be against the view that he can be compelled to do so In these circumstances the plaintiff it seems to me must fail He does not allege in his plaint that the mortgagee proceedings though legal were contrived with a view to secure an advantage to himself and there is no issue framed for the investigation of that question To direct an issue now to this point so long after the sale would seem to be futile moreover it would raise a question which properly should have been and possibly was raised by the plaintiff guardian before the sale or in an application to set aside the sale under Section of the Code I do not think that the plaintiff can ask for an enquiry now and he did not in fact ask for it I would dismiss the appeal with costs If it was necessary to decide the question I should have no difficulty in accepting the conclusion of the District Judge that defendants Nos to are bond fide transferees for consideration within the meaning of Section of the Trusts Act and so are not affected by the trust There is really no evidence pointing the other way The question involved in this appeal is whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim that he has the equity of redemption in certain lands notwithstanding that the defendant father through whom the defendants claim the lands and whom I shall include in the terms defendants purchased the lands in an auction sale in execution of a decree for sale in other words the question is whether the defendants are owners of the lands or merely mortgagees It is not in strict accordance with the form laid down in the Transfer of Property Act for decrees for sale to be passed at the instance of mortgagees but for the purposes of the present appeal it is not disputed that it must be taken to have ordered the sale of the mortgaged property for the purposes of satisfying the claims of the mortgagee The first of these grounds is that the plaintiff was a minor interested in the ancestral property forming the subject of the mortgage and yet he was either not at all or not properly represented in the suit on the mortgage and consequently that the equity of redemption which was vested in the plaintiff was not sold in execution of the decree passed in such a suit The two decrees thus passed on th April and th September in Suit No of were substantially in identical terms the only material difference being that in the latter judgment and decree the nd and rd defendants were represented by their maternal uncle <NAME> as guardian and not by their father There were some other proceedings in the High <ORG> described in the final order of the High <ORG> as an appeal against the order of the District <ORG> of North Arcot dated th September passed on Miscellaneous Petition No of and execution Application No of No of and the appeal was dismissed There is no doubt that though in the decree as ultimately passed the minors were represented by <NAME> and not by their father still in the execution proceedings the father was stated to be the guardian Yet it is clear that <NAME> knew of the execution proceedings that he went up to <ORG> for stay of the sale and was not able to satisfy that Court that there was any ground for staying the sale The argument was that Section of the Transfer of Property Act provides in effect that the sale of a mortgaged property shall be made at the instance of the mortgagee only in pursuance of a mortgage suit in accordance with the provisions of the Act Assuming that the principle underlying Section may be stated broadly as above it seems to me that there is no provision of the Transfer of Property Act which was disregarded in the suit of so as to make the decree passed in the suit any the less effective against the parties to the suit The facts relevant to this contention are as follows There were three mortgages on the property which is the subject matter equally of the present suit and of Suit No of But how can that fact affect the suit on the later mortgages If it did in any way affect the interests of the mortgagor who was the only other person concerned it is extraordinary that the point was not taken in his written statement It seems to me therefore that the decree for sale must be considered to bind the defendants In order that the plaintiff may succeed in this contention it must be shown that the mortgagee a availed himself of his position as such that by doing so gained an advantage that such advantage was in derogation of the rights of other persons interested in the property But there are other reasons why the course does not seem to me to be advisable I shall indicate those reasons in considering the facts that are now before us and in applying them to Section of the Trusts Act The plaintiff in that suit had at the time when the suit was instituted only one other mortgage on the property I have already given reasons for coming to the conclusion that the suit was not instituted by the mortgagee in and that the decree was not passed in contravention of any law Were any rights of the mortgagor violated by the mortgagee being permitted to bid at the auction sale The mortgagee was entitled to ask for permission to bid and there is nothing to show that in getting the permission he was guitly of any fraud or otherwise violated the rights of the mortgagor The fact that there were other mortgages outstanding and that they were both in favour of the decree holder ought to have been a consideration to be borne in mind by the <ORG> in permitting the mortgagee decree holder to bid at the auction sale in execution of the decree But it would be wrong after the lapse of so many years and in the absence of clear evidence to proceed on the basis that this matter was not placed before the <ORG> and due weight was not given to it this is the more so as the sale was sought to be stayed by an order of the High <ORG> and the High <ORG> saw no reason to stop it Had any other person been the purchaser at the auction sale he would I presume have had to purchase the property subject to the prior encumbrances and then it could not have been said that the saving of the rights under the prior encumbrances was unmeaning I come therefore to the conclusion that Section of the Trusts Act cannot avail the appellants because assuming that the mortgagee gained some advantage at the expense of the mortgagor I am unable to say in the circumstances of this case that the advantage was gained by the mortgagee having availed himself of his position as such or that the advantage was gained in derogation of the rights of the mortgagor But if there was such a scheme it seems to have been so planned as hot to contravene any provision of the law On the other hand it is possible that there were satisfactory explanations for all these matters and that the mortgagee acted not only within his strict rights but that he did not do anything which the <ORG> would have disapproved or desired to prevent The events are too distant and the mortgagor was too careless of his own interests to allow the plaintiffs now to seek the assistance of the <ORG> For these reasons I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs
