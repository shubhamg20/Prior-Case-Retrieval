This judgment disposes of the above mentioned petitions as the question involved in all these petitions is identical The question is whether the petitioners who carry on the business of bleaching dyeing printing and finishing cotton fabrics are liable to the excise duty as the manufacturers for the purpose of the Central Excises and Salt Act hereinafter referred to as the Excise Act Since it is common ground that the business carried on by all the petitioners is of the same nature for the purpose of convenience we shall refer to the facts as alleged in Writ Petition No and as the case may be The petitioner has also alleged that it has no discretion in the choice of shades of colours or designs and has to comply with the directions of the customers Consequently in all these petitions as originally filed the petitioners have made claims of refund of the duty which according to them has been illegally recovered The diverse amounts claimed by the petitioners in their respective petitions need not be referred to as nothing turns on the quantum of the amounts claimed by them We shall refer to this decision in detail a little later but it is sufficient for the present to mention that <ORG> in that case has taken the view that processing of cotton fabrics or man made fabrics does not bring into existence any new woven stuff or substance and processing in the form of bleaching dyeing or printing fabrics does not amount to manufacture of any cotton fabrics or man made fabrics falling under Tariff Items No or Consequently <ORG> took the view that the wording of Items Nos and as they stood at the material time did not permit any other levy except that the goods which were received by the petitioners remain the same speaking in terms of excisable goods namely cotton fabrics or man made fabrics and processing did not involve any further manufacture of the woven stuff or woven substance and unlike embroidery and coated or laminated fabrics there was no specific mention in the inclusive definition so far as processed cloth is concerned either in Item No or Item No The amounts collected by way of excise duty from the processors were thus directed to be refunded on the ground that the recoveries were without the authority of law and were illegal levies It is clearly with a view to overcome the decision of <ORG> that an Ordinance called the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Ordinance came to be promulgated by the President of India on th November The original definition of the word manufacture in section contained a general definition of an inclusive nature to say that manufacture includes any process incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product and a special reference to certain processes was made in four sub clauses in that definition in respect of certain articles such as tobacco salt patent or proprietary medicines and lastly in clause iv in relation to goods comprised in Item No A of the First Schedule to the Excise Act Cotton fabrics other than i embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs and ii fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artificial plastic materials a cotton fabrics not subjected to any Twenty per cent process Man made fabrics other than i embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs ii fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artificial plastic materials a man made fabrics not subjected to any Twenty per cent process It provided that Cotton fabrics means all varieties of fabrics manufactured either wholly or partly from cotton and includes dhoties sarees chadders bed sheets bed spreads counter panes table cloths embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs and fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artifical plastic materials Cotton fabrics other than i embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs and ii fabrics impregnated coated or laminated with preparations of cellulose derivatives or of other artifical plastic materials This Item referred to made made fabrics and by the amendment man made fabrics have again been divided into two categories namely a man made fabrics not subjected to any process and man made fabrics subjected to different processes referred to in clause The Amendment Act has been made retrospective in operation and so far as cotton fabrics are concerned it becomes operative from st March and so far as man made fabrics are concerned it becomes operative from th June Section of the Amendment Act also validates duties of excise already levied assessed or collected on cloth cotton cloth cotton fabrics woollen fabrics rayon or artificial silk fabrics and man made fabrics subjected to any process It provides that all duties of excise levied assessed or collected or purported to have been levied assessed or collected before the date of commencement of the Amendment Act on i cloth cotton cloth and cotton fabrics subjected to any process ii woollen fabrics subjected to any process iii rayon or artificial silk fabrics and man made fabrics subjected to any process under any Central Act shall be deemed to be and shall be deemed always to have been as validly levied assessed or collected as if the provisions of section had been in force on and from the appointed day It is also expressly enacted in section of the Amendment Act that every Central Act as in force at any time during the period commencing with the appointed day and ending with day immediately preceding the date of commencement of the Amendment Act and providing for or relating to the levy of duties of excise on a cloth cotton cloth or as the case may be cotton fabrics woollen fabrics rayon or artificial silk fabrics or as the case may be man made fabrics shall have and shall be deemed to have always had effect during the said period as if i such cloth or as the case may be cotton fabrics comprised for the purpose of the duty leviable under the Excise Act A a sub item covering such cloth cotton cloth or cotton fabrics not subjected to any process mentioned in sub clause of clause of section of the Central Excises Act as amended by this Act and a sub item covering such cloth cotton cloth or cotton fabrics subjected to any such process or any two or more such processes and the rate of duty specified in such Act with respect to such cloth cotton cloth of cotton fabrics had been specified separately with respect to each of the aforementioned sub items thereof Similar provision was also made in clause iii of sub section of section in respect of rayon or artificial silk fabrics or man made fabrics With this effect of the amendments there is no dispute between the parties The only way by which the petitioners could have got rid of the liability to pay the excise duty on the processed cloth that is cloth subjected to the processes of bleaching dyeing and printing was to attack the Amendment Act and that is what has been done by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in the course of the arguments in these petitions Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except a alcoholic liquors for human consumption opium Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics but including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub paragraph of this entry It is argued before us that entry authorises levy of excise duty on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India It is argued that it is not open to the <ORG> to enact a provision giving an artificial meaning to the word manufacture It must be given its etymological meaning Reliance was placed before us on certain decisions which turn on the question as to whether a particular process was a manufacturing process or not He also relied on certain decisions in support of his argument that dyeing and printing processes are manufacturing processes What is the test which has to be applied before deciding whether a particular process is a manufacturing process or not and what is the essential requirement which must be satisfied before a particular process is described as a manufacturing process or not to be a manufacturing process has been subject matter of some of the decisions of <ORG> Their contention was that at no stage they produced any new product which can come within the items described in the Schedule as vegetable non essential oils all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power After referring to the argument of the counsel for the revenue that manufacture is complete as soon as by the application of one or more processes the raw material undergoes some change it has been observed by <ORG> as follows page To say this is to equate processing to manufacture and for this we can find no warrant in law The word manufacture used as a verb is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change is a substance however minor in consequence the change may be The passage runs thus Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use Thus according to <ORG> if a new substance is brought into existence or if a new or different article having a distinctive name character or use result from particular processes such processes would amount to manufacture <ORG> has referred to the earlier decision in <ORG> case and observed that there must be such a transformation that a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use It is not in dispute that what is given to the processors is grey cloth which is unbleached Cotton fabric is merely a general description but there may be various types of cotton fabrics and it can never be said that all cotton fabrics are identical or are the same as the base material which was originally given to the processors We may at this stage refer to the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case Even though <ORG> held that cotton fabrics subjected to bleaching dyeing and printing could not be subject to the excise duty under Item No I it is important to note that <ORG> proceeded on the footing that the processes of bleaching dyeing and printing are manufacturing processes and held that excise duty would be leviable under residuary Item No of the First Schedule Item refers to All other goods not specified elsewhere manufactured in a factory But as we have already pointed out above even etymologically the processes of bleaching dyeing and printing must be described as manufacturing processes The petitioner in that case had been printing and lacquering only plain extruded tubes and the question was whether by printing and lacquering the plain extruded tubes of aluminium the petitioners firstly applied any further process of extrusion to them and did they thereby manufacture tubes and it was held that printing and lacquering are not even remotely connected with the manufacture of aluminium tubes and that it was a process independent of the manufacture of aluminium tubes The question as to whether a particular process is a process of manufacture or not has to be determined having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case and having regard to the well known tests laid down by <ORG> In any case there is no similarity of facts in the Extrusion Process case and the present cases <ORG> referred to a series of cases in some of which it was held that a different commercial article had come into existence and in some others where although the original commodity had undergone a degree of processing it had not lost its original identity But where the commodity retains a continuing substantial identity through the processing stage we cannot say that it has been manufactured Having regard to what we have said earlier unless it is possible for us to say that a dyed printed and finished cotton fabric had substantially the same identity as the grey cloth it would be difficult for us to accept the contention of the petitioners that these processes are not processes of manufacture Undoubtedly <ORG> in that case held that although the colour of the cloth had changed by printing and processing the cloth exported was the same as the cloth sold by the petitioners and they were therefore entitled to the exemption under the notification The facts of that case will show that what fell for consideration before <ORG> was the identity of the cloth purchased and exported having regard to the use of the words such cloth in the notification It was also pointed out that the words such cloth or yarn would mean cloth or yarn manufactured in Uttar Pradesh and sold and those words have nothing to do with the transformation by printing and designs on the cloth But since the decision turned on the construction of the notification in which any change in appearance or transformation of an article into another did not become relevant we do not think that this decision is of any assistance to Mr <NAME> On first principles we have already held that the processes of bleaching dyeing and printing did bring into existence a new marketable commodity different from the grey cloth which is handed over to the processors We find that we are supported in this view by some decisions which were brought to our notice by Mr <NAME> It does appear that the concept of manufacture has been given a very wide meaning but it is not necessary for us to go into the question as to whether that view is correct or not because we have already referred to the later decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case and <ORG> case All that we wish to point out is that <ORG> took the view that a person who is engaged in the work of printing and dyeing textiles purchased by him and in the business or selling or supplying the printed and dyed material is a manufacturer within the definition given in section of the Madhya Bharat Sales Tax Act Referring to the decision in <NAME> case <ORG> observed as follows page The decision of <ORG> might perhaps be justified on the ground that a printed or dyed cloth is commercially a different article from the cloth which is purchased and printed or dyed Though this observation cannot be read as an express approval of the broad proposition propounded by <ORG> in <NAME> case the fact remains that even according to <ORG> a printed or dyed cloth is commercially a different article from the cloth which is purchased and printed or dyed a conclusion we have already reached on construing the meaning of the word manufacture The Division Bench in that case positively took the view that sizing bleaching or dyeing of raw cloth turns it into a different marketable commodity and as such amounts to manufacture of a commercially new product We must therefore reject the argument having regard to what we have stated earlier and the decisions referred to above advanced on behalf of the petitioners that when grey cloth is subjected to the processes of bleaching dyeing printing and finishing there is no manufacture of a new marketable commodity Consequently we must also reject the argument that when these processes are included in the definition of the word manufacture by the Amendment Act no artificial concept of manufacture has been introduced and challenge to the validity of the Amendment Act on that ground must therefore fail The other ground on which the validity of the Amendment Act is challenged is that by giving the amendments retrospective effect by section thereof there is an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners fundamental rights to carry on business and the Amendment Act is therefore invalid as being violative of article of the Constitution of India That by itself would not amount to unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business As already pointed out if there is power in the <ORG> to enact retrospective legislation it would also include a fiscal legislation and imposition of tax liability <ORG> then passed an Amendment Act of to rectify and remove the defect in the language found by <ORG> and to validate the past levy and collection of tax in respect of all kinds of non lubricant mineral oils including furnace oil at the rate specified in entry from April when Act of came into force It was further pointed out that the fact that a dealer is not in a position to pass on the sales tax to others does not affect the competence of the legislature to enact a law imposing sales tax retrospectively it being a matter of legislative policy The <ORG> has been extremely reluctant to override the legislative judgment as to the necessity for retrospective taxation not only because of the paramount governmental interest in obtaining adequate revenues but also because taxes are not in the nature of a penalty or a contractual obligation but rather a means of apportioning the costs of government among those who benefit from it This disposes of the contention raised with regard to the constitutional validity of the Amendment Act When we read the charging provision in section of the Excise Act it will appear clear that the object of the entries in the First Schedule is two fold Firstly they are intended to specify excisable goods and secondly they are intended to specify the rates at which excise duties would be levied The same principle will apply in the case of substitution of new Item No regarding man made fabrics That brings us to the last argument vehemently advanced by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> with regard to excisable value of goods Under that provision it is expressly provided that where the duty of excise is chargeable on any excisable goods with reference to value such value shall be deemed to be the normal price thereof and by normal price it means the price at which the goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale We have tried to ascertain from the learned counsel as to whether there is any allegation in any of these petitions to show that they have disputed the normal price on the basis of which recoveries have been made The main grievance appears to be that while the processors get the grey cloth on which duty is already paid they are required to pay duty on the basis of the value of the manufactured article which also includes the value of grey cloth on which excise duty has already been paid and the basic contention is that there is double levy of excise duty Mr <NAME> has referred us to Rule A of the Rules which provides for special procedure for movement of duty paid materials or component parts for use in the manufacture of finished excisable goods Under sub rule of Rule A it is expressly provided that a manufacturer will be given credit for they duty which is already paid on the articles already used in the manufacture subject to certain conditions and it is not now in dispute before us irrespective of the question whether such claim for grant of credit was made or not that in view of the provisions of this Rule when excise duty will be charged on a processed printed material the processors will be given credit for the duty already paid on the grey cloth by the manufacturer of the grey cloth Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the <ORG> at considerable length we are not satisfied that there is any substance in the challenges raised to the Amendment Act Rules issued in all these petitions are discharged As we have found no substance in these petitions we are not inclined to stay the operation of the judgment as requested
