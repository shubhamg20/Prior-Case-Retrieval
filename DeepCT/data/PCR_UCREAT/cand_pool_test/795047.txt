We shall however first set out the relevant facts to understand the context in which this question comes up for consideration Here the difference between the old and new process is that the solution which is obtained at the intermediate stage in the old process was the commercial product known as phenolic resin while in the new process the intermediate product contained a component referred to above as Desmodur AP which is a Volatile Solvent and which is not present in Phenolic resin as known to the market The petitioner filed a reply pointing out in particular that the appeal from the order dated th June was pending However by an order dated th February the Assistant Collector of <ORG> called upon the petitioner to pay <ORG> Duty amounting to Rs The petitioner filed an appeal to the Appellate Collector of <ORG> who rejected the appeal on th September In these circumstances the petitioner came to this <ORG> and of by which it sought for appropriate reliefs against the orders of the respondents dated th June th February th March th September and th November for orders restraining the respondents from removing excise duty amounting to Rs We have earlier referred to the fact that on th June the Assistant Collector of Central Excise called upon the petitioner to take out a license for the manufacture of synthetic resin in the factory that this order had been confirmed by the Appellate Collector on th March and that the petitioner had filed a revision petition before <ORG> against the order of the Appellate Collector The Company however has come to this Court with of praying that the orders dated th June st August and th December be quashed and that the respondents be directed to refund the excise duty of Rs We have set out the facts at some length because two types of processes were being employed by the assessed and it is necessary to understand these in order to answer the question that comes up for consideration in these writ petitions The petitioner case is that it is engaged in the manufacture of varnish which is being utilised by it for insulating the wires rods and other electrical materials According to the petitioner it makes no difference whether the varnish finally emerges as a result of Chemical reactions in one kettle but there is only one end product manufactured by the petitioner viz It may be that in plant and there is only one the course of this single process of manufacture a product is obtained which may perhaps fall within the description in Item A The petitioner case is that it does not but that even assuming for purposes of argument that this interim product can be described as polyester or phenolic resin it is not liable to duty because the interim product is only an in process product which is neither intended to be nor is in fact removed from the place of manufacture In the single kettle process there is no removal at all and in the two kettle process what is transferred from one kettle to another is a hot molten liquid which passes on to the second kettle as a step or stage in the integrated process of manufacture of varnish carried out by the petitioner In these circumstances it is submitted that other questions apart there is no removal of the resin so as to attract duty within the meaning of Rule read with Rule of the Central Excise Rules It will be necessary for the present discussion to start with a somewhat detailed reference to the decision of this court in the <ORG> case supra because that decision deals with the basic issues involved in this writ petition Several contentions were urged on behalf of the petitioner Therefore Burner Fuel Oil is not excisable goods and there is no manufacture of goods within the meaning of the said Act There is no removal of Burner Fuel Oil within the meaning of Rule of the said Rules The judgment of the court was delivered by one of us <NAME> At the outset it explained the scope of Section of the Act read with Rules and as follows The legislative intent for levy and collection of excise duty on a reading of the Excise Act and the Excise Rules appears to be that no duty is payable on intermediate products if the intermediate products by themselves are not the end products being manufactured by a particular factory provided however the intermediate products and the end products are obtained by one continuous uninterrupted integrated process as opposed to distinct or independent processes We find force in Mr <NAME> contention that the concept of making assessment only at the stage of removal supports this legislative intent Rule is a direction to the excise authorities that the payment of excise duty shall not be demanded until excisable goods are about to be issued out of place or premises specified under Rule or are about to be removed from a store room or other place or storage approved by the Collector under Rule If there is no removal there would be no question of payment We have therefore to see whether in the present case the product in question is a only an intermediate product obtained in the process of manufacturing of any other finished petroleum product whether this product is treated as an end product or only an intermediate product by processing of which may other product is to be obtained and whether this product can be regarded as having been removed at any stage for any of the purposes mentioned in Rule of the Excise Rules It was urged on behalf of the petitioner in that case that even where oil was used for heating purposes it was really a self generating fuel obtained the process of manufacture of various petroleum products and that even if consumed for heating it was part of an integrated uninterrupted continuous process of manufacture because the self generating fuel was a necessity for the running of the plant to get the end product The decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> Assistant Collector and others Miscellaneous Case No of decided on was relied upon on behalf of the petitioner but distinguished as under <ORG> had held that polymer chips did not attract the levy of excise duty as the same were utilised in an uninterrupted integrated process for the manufacture of Nylon yarn and there was no removal within the meaning of Rule read with Rule of the Excise Rules For though there would be no dispute with the proposition that an intermediate product used for obtaining the end product in a single uninterrupted process would not attract duty the intermediate product would attract duty if it is obtained by one process and was used for being converted into another product by a separate and distinct process It obviously makes no reference to the plant or equipment We think that the above decision completely governs the present case In the process followed by the petitioner prior to there were two stages of manufacture The <ORG> found that the flat form from which callots were punched was a produce commercially known as zinc sheets and accepted the argument on behalf of the <ORG> that though the zinc sheets did not go out the factory premises as such there was a removal in law as contemplated in Rule because they were admittedly removed from the rolling mill for consumption or for manufacture of another excisable commodity We direct in the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing a the orders dated and of the second respondent Exhibits the orders dated and of the third respondent Exhibits and the orders dated and of the first respondent Exhibits and the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to refund to the petitioners the excise duty of Rs In we direct the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the orders dated Exhibit I Exhibit and Exhibit and the issue of writ of mandamus directing the respondent to refund to the petitioner the sum of Rs
