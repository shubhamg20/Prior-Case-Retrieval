The revisions arise out of an application filed on July before <ORG> by <NAME> widow of <NAME> against <ORG> Respondent No <NAME> truck driver Respondent No and <ORG> Respondent No Written statements were filed on behalf of all the three respondents and they contested the application The following issues were framed in the case Whether it is nto a properly constituted <ORG> under section of the Act Whether the injuries to <NAME> were caused by the negligence of the respondent No and whether the death of <NAME> occurred due to these injuries To what amount of compensation if any is the petitioner entitled and from whom Whether the respondent No was driving the vehicle at the time of accident in course of employment of respondent No On September an application was filed on behalf of <NAME> that the name of Respondent No be struck off as a party as the aforesaid respondent had taken grounds in the written statement which were nto covered by sub section of section of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act Another application was filed by <NAME> petitioner under Order rule Code of Civil Procedure praying that Issue No which arose out of the pleas raised by Respondent No might be deleted On February <ORG> filed an application under section of the Code of Civil Procedure for leave to defend the claim of <NAME> in the name of <ORG> This application was resisted by <NAME> In order to appreciate the points of controversy we may refer to the relevant provisions of the Act Section deals with the duty of insurers to satisfy judgments against persons insured in respect of third party risks Sub section of that section provides that if after a certificate of insurance has been issued in favor of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of such liability is obtained against any person insured by the policy the insurer shall subject to other provisions pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum nto exceeding the sum assured payable there under as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with the amount of costs and interest Sub section of section has a bearing and reads as under No sum shall be payable by an insurer under subsection in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the Court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely That the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provisions contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or nto later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of section or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely a condition excluding the use of the vehicle A for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle nto covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward or for organized racing and speed testing or for a purpose nto allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a transport vehicle or II a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is nto duly licensed or by any person who has been dis qualified for holding or obtaining a driving license during the period of disqualification or III a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war rito or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular It is nto disputed before us that none of the grounds mentioned in clauses a and of sub section of section exists in the present case Bare perusal of the relevant part of sub section which has been reproduced above makes it plain that an insurer upon whom liability is sought to be fastened in respect of any amount regarding which legal proceedings are taken against the insured has to be served with a notice of the proceedings through the <ORG> The insurer on receipt of that notice has a right to be imp leaded as a party to the proceedings It may also be mentioned that apart from the statute the insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person or the heirs of the deceased against the insured causing the injury Sub section of section however gives the right to the insurer to be made a party The right is thus created by statute and its scope and extent would necessarily be governed by the provisions of the statute Sub section of section however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it The right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute It would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others To do that would be adding words to the statute Mr <NAME> on behalf of <NAME> has argued that the insurer has a right to be imp leaded as a party only if the insurer takes up any of the defenses mentioned in clauses a and of sub section of section of the Act An insurer to whom notice under sub section of section of the Act is given has a right to be imp leaded as party to the proceedings In that case <ORG> of Bombay High Court <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held If the ex parte decree was passed against the defendant and if <ORG> through the defendant satisfied the Court that <ORG> did nto have reasonable opportunity to defend the action then the Court acting under its inherent jurisdiction would set aside the ex parte decree because although the defendant might have had sufficient cause to defend the action if the defense was being conducted by <ORG> and the defendant was only a nominal defendant then it is nto sufficient that the defendant should have had ample opportunity to defend the action but <ORG> should also be given ample opportunity to defend the action There is no question of setting aside an ex parte decree at the instance of an insurer in the present case There is however nothing in that case which militates against the view we have taken in the matter Mr <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> has argued that the provisions of section of the Act apply only to proceedings in a regular suit before a civil court and nto to proceedings before <ORG> herein referred to as <ORG> We have given the matter our consideration and are of the view that the provisions of section of the Act are intended to govern all proceedings in which question arises about the liability of the insurer to satisfy judgment against persons insured in respect of third party risks There is nothing in that section which restricts the applicability of its provision to proceedings in a regular suit in a civil court and which excludes from their ambit the proceedings before <ORG> Section and the other provisions of Chapter Viii of the Act were enacted with a view to remove that difficulty and mitigate the harshness of the general law It is significant that according to sub section of section of the Act <ORG> shall have all the powers of <ORG> for the purpose of taking evidence on oath and of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and of compelling the discovery and production of documents and material objects and for such other purposes as may be prescribed It has further been provided that <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> for all the purposes of section and Chapter xxxv of the Code of Criminal Procedure In Civil Revision No Mr <NAME> has argued that <ORG> was in error in disallowing the application of the insurance company for leave to defend the claim of <NAME> in the name of the transport company Captain <NAME> and others is that an insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defenses open to the assured can be urged by him He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured In the present case the insurance company mentioned in Para of the application that there was a condition of policy between the insurance company and the transport company to allow the insurance company to defend the action in the name of the transport company No effort was made by the insurance company to substantiate that allegation with the result that there is nothing on the record which might prove the existence of such a condition in the policy of insurance There is also no ground of revision that the insurance company was denied the right to prove the existence of such a condition and that it should have been granted an opportunity for the purpose In the circumstances we find no sufficient ground to interfere with the order of the <ORG> by which the <ORG> disallowed the application of the insurance company to defend the claim in the name of the transport company
