State Law imposing tax on goods carried by road or inland waterways Constitutionaly of Constitution of India Arts that the Act violated Art was wider than that contained in Of the Government of India Act and it included freedom from tax laws also Article provides that the flow of trade shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at the boundaries of the States or at any other points inside the States themselves and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the movement of goods it attracts the provisions of Art and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfied the requirements of Art did not mean freedom from taxation simpliciter but only from the erection of trade barriers tariff walls and imposts which had a deleterious effect on the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse The Assam Taxation on goods carried by road and inland waterways Act contravenes Art Article may also refer to tax in certain circumstances in cases other than those covered by Art Article uses the words in the public interest It is likely that if the Constitution makers wanted to put a bar on the taxation power it would have been placed in Part XII and not left to be inferred from Art Article a assumes that there is an existing tax on goods which is not levied under a There is an intermediate position also Article is concerned with the right of passage generally with respect to trade and commerce and Art The Judgment of <NAME> <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The judgment of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> of the Constitution impugn the constitutionality of the Assam Taxation on Goods Carried by Roads or Inland Waterways Act Assam Act XIII of which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act Thereupon the appellants obtained the certificates that the cases involved substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution The appellants and the petitioners will in the course of this judgment be referred to for the sake of convenience as the appellants The purpose of the Act is to levy taxes on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways in the <ORG> of Assam On June the second respondent the Commissioner of Taxes Assam in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by subs of of the Act published a notification in <ORG> bearing date June by which he notified for general information that the return under the aforesaid Act and the rules made thereunder for the period commencing June to September should be furnished by October The said notification also demanded the furnishing of quarterly returns before January and April for the quarters ending December and March respectively of the Constitution challenging the validity of the said Act and praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to forbear from giving effect to the provisions of the Act and the notification issued under the Act and or a writ of prohibition or any other appropriate writ restraining them from taking steps under the provisions of the Act The appellants challenged the validity of the Act mainly on the grounds that the Act rules and the notifications under the Act were ultra vires the Constitution because the Act was repugnant to the provisions of Art The competence of <ORG> to legislate on the subject was also questioned It was denied by the <ORG> that the Act or the rules made thereunder or the notifications issued thereunder were ultra vires the Constitution or that the Act contravened the provisions of Art The case of the respondents was that the Act was in pith and substance a legislation to levy tax on certain classes and types of goods carried by road or inland waterways strictly within entry no of the <ORG> List He also held that the impost levied by the Act was not in the nature of an excise duty and that there was no substance in the contention that it encroached upon entry of the Union List On the crucial question arising in this case his conclusion was that taxation per se has not the effect of abridging or curtailing the freedom contemplated by Art and restrict the powers of <ORG> and <ORG> in the matter of legislation under entries of List of List and of List III and that restrictions properly so called on the movement of goods and traffic must find their justification from the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution that the impugned Act made provision for taxation which did not directly impinge upon the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse within the meaning of Art His view also was that in some cases taxation may have the effect of placing restrictions on movement of goods and traffic and if it has that effect it comes within the mischief of Art was that there was no proof forthcoming of any real discrimination between persons and things From the judgment of <ORG> the appellants have come up in appeal on certificates granted by <ORG> They raise the same questions as arise for determination in the three appeals from the decision of <ORG> Restriction in the context of Part XIII meant legislation which had the effect of impeding the free flow of goods and traffic by erection of tariff walls for example a tariff wall if erected by a <ORG> may be justiciable but not legislation simply imposing a tax for purposes of revenue The Advocate General of the several States who appeared in this case supported the viewpoint stressed by the learned Attorney General It has not been and it could not be contended that the generality of the expressions used in Art All parties are agreed that trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India have been emphatically declared by the Constitution to be free but there is a wide divergence of views on the answer to the question free from what It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the answer to this question must be that trade commerce and intercourse throughout India shall be free from everything including taxation No Provincial Legislature or Government shall a by virtue of the entry in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province or the entry in that list relating to the production supply and distribution of commodities have power to pass any law or take any executive action prohibiting or restricting the entry into or export from the Province of goods of any class or description or by virtue of anything in this Act have power to impose any tax cess toll or due which as between goods manufactured or produced in the Province and similar goods not so manufactured or produced discriminates in favour of the former or which in the case of goods manufactured or produced outside the Province discriminates between goods manufactured or produced in one locality and similar goods manufactured or produced in another locality It will be noticed that the prohibition contained in the section quoted above applied only to Provincial Governments and Provincial Legislatures with reference to entries in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province and to production supply and distribution of commodities and prohibited discrimination against goods manufactured or produced outside a Province or goods produced in different localities There were a large number of them with varying degrees of sovereignty vested in them On the other hand taxes on goods and passengers carried by road or inland waterways come under entry of List II <ORG> List In short Part XII is a self contained series of provisions relating to the finances of the <ORG> and of the <ORG>s and their interrelation and adjustments ignoring the provisions in Chapter of that Part relating to borrowing and Chapter relating to property contracts etc But it has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the pro would show that it is divided into two parts viz There is a prohibition against <ORG> as also against the <ORG> of a <ORG> making any law giving preference to one <ORG> over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one <ORG> and another Hence any legislation under those entries which has the effect of directly interfering with trade commerce and intercourse being free throughout the territory of India has to be struck down as infringing the provisions of Art In such a situation <ORG> has been armed with the power to grant preference to one <ORG> over another or to make a discrimination as between two and more <ORG>s if the Law dealing with such a situation declares that it is necessary to do so in order to deal with an emergency like the one referred to above In my opinion there is no warrant for such an extreme position If that were so all laws of taxation relating to sale and purchase of goods on carriage of goods and commodities men and animals from one place to another both inter State and intraState would come within the purview of Art If a law is passed by the <ORG> imposing a tax which in its true nature and effect is meant to impose an impediment to the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse for example by imposing a high tariff wall or by preventing imports into or exports out of a <ORG> such a law is outside the significance of taxation as such but assumes the character of a trade barrier which it was the intention of the Constitution makers to abolish by Part XIII Laws relating to taxation which is essentially a legislative function of the <ORG> will become justiciable and every time a taxation law is challenged as unconstitutional the <ORG> will have to satisfy the courts a course which will seriously affect the division of powers on which modern constitutions including ours are based while recognising the power of a <ORG> <ORG> to tax goods imported inter <ORG> insists that a similar tax is imposed on goods manufactured or produced within the <ORG> Article with which Part XIII commences contains the crucial words shall be free and provides the key to the solution of the problems posed by the whole Part As already indicated the several entries in the three Lists would suggest that both <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> have been given the power to legislate in respect of trade commerce and intercourse but it is equally clear that legislation should not have the effect of putting impediments in the way of free flow of trade and commerce The <ORG> and <ORG> therefore have the power to legislate by way of taxation in respect of trade commerce and intercourse so as not to erect trade barriers tariff walls or imposts which have a deleterious effect on the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse That freedom has further been circumscribed by the power vested in <ORG> or in <ORG> to impose restrictions in the public interest does not mean freedom from taxation simpliciter but does mean freedom from taxation which has the effect of directly impeding the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse the freedom envisaged in Art reasonable restrictions may be imposed by the Legislature of a State in the public interest Art non discriminatory taxes may be imposed by the Legislature of a State on goods imported from another State or other States if similar taxes are imposed on goods produced or manufactured in that State Art a and lastly restrictions imposed by existing laws have been continued except in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct Art The Act as the preamble shows is intended to impose a tax on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways Dealer has been defined in as under Dealer means a person who owns jute in bales before it is carried by motor vehicle cart trolley boat animal and human agency or any other means except railways or airways and includes his agent The tax on manufactured tea in chests is to be paid by the producer which term includes the person in charge of the garden where tea is produced Section makes provision for licensing of balers which means persons who own or possess a pressing machine for the compression of jute into bales Section lays down the procedure of assessment and the procedure for cancellation of assessment in certain cir cumstances Section lays down the procedure for assessment in such cases as have escaped assessment or there has been an evasion of the tax of the Constitution it is necessary to advert to the other contentions raised on behalf of the appellants We have therefore to address ourselves to the question whether or not it is covered by any of the entries in List of the Seventh Schedule There is no occasion in this case to take recourse to the doctrine of pith and substance inasmuch as the Act is a simple piece of taxing statute meant to tax transport of goods in this case jute and tea by road or on inland waterways In my opinion it is a very simple case of taxation completely covered by entry but the argument against the competence of <ORG> has been sought to be supported by the subsidiary contention that though in form it is a tax on the transport of goods within the terms of entry in substance it is an imposition of excise duty within the meaning of entry in List of the Seventh Schedule but in my opinion there is no substance in this contention for the simple reason that so long as jute or tea is not sought to be transported from one place to another within the <ORG> or outside the <ORG> no tax is sought to be levied by the Act <NAME> on sale of goods but was in substance a duty of excise in these terms This argument however overlooks the fact that under <NAME> ii the producer or manufacturer became liable to pay the tax not because he produced or manufactured the goods but because he sold the goods If the goods produced or manufactured in Bihar were destroyed by fire before sale the manufacturer or producer would not have been liable to pay any tax under read with second proviso As <NAME> said in <NAME> case supra at the manufacturer or producer would be liable if at all to a sales tax because he sells and not because he manufactures or produces and he would be free from liability if he chose to give away everything which came from his factory It must therefore be held that the Act does what it sets out to do namely to impose a tax on goods carried by road or on inland waterways It was argued that the tea industry was a controlled one within the competence <ORG> The Tea Act declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take the tea industry under its control With the objectives aforesaid Chapter III lays down provisions for the control over the extension of tea cultivation and Chapter IV deals with provisions for control over the export of tea and tea seed There are no provisions of the Tea Act which can be said to come into conflict with the provisions of the impugned Act It is not denied that there is some real and substantial nexus to support the taxing statute but it is contended that relatively to the whole journey to be covered by the merchandise the portion of the territory of Assam covered in that journey is very small It is clear therefore that there is no infirmity attaching to the Act on the ground that it is extra territorial in its operation It is not for the courts to say that there were other ways of doing the thing or that all forms and varities should have been brought under the scope of the taxation As all the grounds of attack raised against the con stitutionality of the Act fail the appeals and the petitions in my opinion should be dismissed with costs I have deliberately refrained from making references to or relying upon decisions from other countries like the A or Australia because the cases decided in those countries cannot be any guide for the solution of the problems raised in this case inasmuch as the framework of the Constitution in those countries is not in pari materia with ours This group consists of three appeals brought to this Court with a certificate issued by <ORG> under Art The Act has been passed by <ORG> in order to provide for the levy of a tax on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways in the State of Assam and it has received the assent of the Governor on April By their respective petitions the appellants prayed that a writ of mandamus should issue directing the respondent and its officers to forbear from giving effect to the provisions of the Act and from otherwise enforcing it against the appellants The petitioners also claimed alternatively a writ of prohibition or any other appropriate writ restraining the respondent and its officers from enforcing the Act against the appellants The appellants challenged the vires of the Act on several grounds The principal ground however was that the Act had violated the provisions of Art It was also urged that tea was a controlled industry under the provisions of Act of and so it was the Union Government alone which was competent to regulate the manufacture production distribution or transport of the said commodity that being so <ORG> was not competent to pass the Act The validity of the Act was further challenged on the ground that though the Act purported to have been passed under Entry of List in substance and in reality it was a duty of excise and as such it could be enacted only under Entry of List The correctness of these contentions was disputed by the respondent It urged that the Act was perfectly within the competence of <ORG> under Entry of List II and that the provisions of Part XIII were wholly inapplicable to it had not been violated and that there was no substance in the argument that as controlled industry it is only the Union Government which could deal with it or that in reality the Act bad imposed a duty of excise The petitions filed by the appellants were heard by a Special Bench of <ORG> All the pleas raised by the appellants were rejected by <NAME> and <NAME> who delivered separate but concurring judgments The respondent has attempted to subject the petitioners to the provisions of the Act and the petitioners have challenged the authority of the respondent to levy a tax against them under the Act on the ground that the Act is ultra vires Since the principal question raised in these appeals appeared to be of considerable importance in which other States may also be interested we directed that notice should be issued to the Attorney General of India and the Advocates General in all the States of India The words used in Art This alternative argument would bring within the purview of Part XIII Entry in List I which refers to interState trade and commerce Entry in List II which deals with trade and commerce within the State subject to the provisions of Entry in List III and Entry in List III which deals with trade and commerce as therein specified A large number of these States claimed sovereign rights within the limitations imposed by the paramount power in that behalf and they pur ported to exercise their legislative power of imposing taxes in respect of trade and commerce which inevitably led to the erection of customs barriers between themselves and the rest of India In appreciating the significance of these general consi derations we may profitably refer to the observations made by <NAME> <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> while he was dealing with the commerce clause contained in Art There is another general consideration which has been pressed before us by the learned Attorney General and the States to which reference must be made we should bear in mind the fact that to the extent to which the frontiers of this freedom are widened to that extent is the legislative power of the States curtailed or limited legislate in respect of topics covered by the legislative entries in Parts II and III If the words used in Art and determining the scope and effect of Part XIII we should bear in mind the effect of our decision on the legislative power of the <ORG> and also of <ORG> Having thus referred to some general considerations let us now proceed to examine the question as to whether tax laws are wholly outside the purview of Part XIII In support of the argument that Part XIII does not apply to tax laws the learned Attorney General has emphasised the fact that the power to levy a tax is an essential part of sovereignty itself and he has suggested that this power is not subject to judicial review and never has been held to be so stated that the power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of the government and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the government may choose to carry it Therefore the true position appears to be that though the power of levying tax is essential for the very existence of the government its exercise must inevitably be controlled by the constitutional provisions made in that behalf is not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution it could not be enforced under Art The argument is that Part XII is a self contained code it makes all necessary provisions and so the validity of any taxing statute can be judged only by reference to the provisions of the said Part which deals with the extent of laws made by <ORG> and by the <ORG>s of States it begins with the words subject to the provisions of this Constitution in other words the power of <ORG> and the <ORG>s of the States to make laws including laws imposing taxes is subject to the provisions of this Constitution and that must bring in the application of the provisions of Part XIII read in its proper context and subject to the limitations prescribed by the other relevant Articles in Part XIII must be regarded as imposing a constitutional limitation on the legislative power of <ORG> and the <ORG>s of the States No Provincial Legislature or Government shall a by virtue of the entry in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province or the entry in that List relating to the production supply and distribution of commodities have power to pass any law or take any executive action prohibiting or restricting the entry into or export from the Province of goods of any class or description or by virtue of anything in this Act have power to impose any tax cess toll or due which as between goods manufactured or produced in the Province and similar goods not so manufactured or produced discriminates in favour of the former or which in the case of goods manufactured or produced outside the Province discriminates between goods manufactured or produced in one locality and similar goods manufactured or produced in another locality There is no doubt that the prohibition prescribed by this section was confined to the Provincial Governments and <ORG> and did not apply to the <ORG> or <ORG> Likewise discrimination against goods manufactured or produced outside the Province or goods produced in other localities is also prohibited it had in view and the only substantial change which it intended to make was to extend the application of the principles enunciated in the said section to <ORG> and <ORG> and to apply it to the territory which had subsequently become a part of India as indicated by the relevant Articles the essential content of freedom of trade and commerce as prescribed by the said section however continues to be the same It had been urged before the Court that the said entry should be liberally construed and should be held to include the power to tax and in support of this contention reliance was placed on certain American and Australian decisions In coming to this conclusion the learned judge made certain general observations pointing out that it would not be always safe to rely upon American or Australian decisions in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution with reference to the question of taxation as it merely reproduces of the Government of India Act and as there was no provision therein corresponding to Art They knew that the Constitution would herald a new and inspiring era in the history of India and they were fully conscious of the importance of maintaining the economic unity of the Union of India in order that the federal form of government adopted by the Constitution should progress in a smooth and harmonious manner That is why we are inclined to hold that the broad and unambiguous words used in Art That takes us to the question as to whether Art There is no doubt that the sweep of the concept of trade commerce and intercourse is very wide but in the present case we are concerned with trade and so we will leave out of consideration commerce and intercourse Even as to trade it is really not necessary to discuss or determine what trade exactly means for it is common ground that the activity carried on by the appellants amounts to trade and it is not disputed that transport of goods or merchandise from one place to another is so essential to trade that it can be regarded as its integral part is freedom from all restrictions except those which are provided by the other Articles in Part XIII What these restrictions denote may raise a larger issue but in the present case we will confine our decision to that aspect of the matter which arises from the provisions of the Act under scrutiny confers on the <ORG> power to impose restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse That takes us to Art Notwithstanding anything in article neither <ORG> nor the <ORG> of a State shall have power to make any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Nothing in clause shall prevent <ORG> from making any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference or making or authorising the making of any discrimination if it is declared by such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India This clause prohibits <ORG> from making any law which would give any preference to one State over another or would make any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of the relevant entries specified in it In other words in regard to the entries there specified the power to impose restrictions cannot be used for the purpose of giving any preference to one State over another or making any discrimination in that manner It empowers the <ORG> to make a law giving or authorising to give any preference or making any discrimination but this power can be exercised only if it is declared by law made by the <ORG> that it is necessary so to do for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India in other words it is only when <ORG> is faced with the task of meeting an emergency created by the scarcity of goods in any particular part of India that it is authorised to make a law making a discrimination or giving preference in favour of the part thus affected On behalf of the States strong reliance is placed on the fact that Art itself There is some force in this contention but on the whole we are not prepared to hold that the reference to the said entries should govern the construction of Art it was thought expedient to prohibit expressly the said power of imposing restrictions from being used for the purpose of giving any preference in so far as the relevant entries are concerned Besides as we will presently point out there are other Articles in this Part which indicate that tax laws are included within Art Article reads thus Notwithstanding anything in article or article <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other States or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced and impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause shall be introduced or moved in the <ORG> of a <ORG> without the previous sanction of the President a is to treat imported goods on the same basis as goods manufactured or produced in any <ORG> and it authorises tax to be levied on such imported goods in the same manner and to the same extent as may be levied on goods manufactured or produced inside the <ORG> We ought to add that this sub Article assumes that taxation can be levied by <ORG> on goods manufactured or produced within its territory and it provides that outside goods cannot be treated any worse How a tax can be levied on internal goods is however provided by Art and in substance it gives power to <ORG> somewhat similar to the power conferred on the <ORG> by Art There are however obvious differences in the powers of the <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG>s That is another additional restriction imposed on the powers of <ORG>s Thus there are three conditions which must be satisfied in passing an Act under Art a and together appears to be that a tax can be levied by a <ORG> <ORG> on goods manufactured or produced or imported in the <ORG> and thereby reasonable restrictions can be placed on the freedom of trade either with another <ORG> or between different areas of the same <ORG> It reads thus Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part or in any other provisions of this Constitution any State specified in Part of the First Schedule which before the commencement of this Constitution was levying any tax or duty on the import of goods into the State from other States or on the export of goods from the State to other States may if an agreement in that behalf has been entered into between <ORG> and the Government of that State continue to levy and collect such tax or duty subject to the terms of such agreement and for such period not exceeding ten years from the commencement of this Constitution as may be specified in the agreement Provided that the President may at any time after the expiration of five years from such commencement terminate or modify any such agreement if after consideration of the report of <ORG> constituted under article he thinks it necessary to do so If the transport or the movement of goods is taxed solely on the basis that the goods are thus carried or transported that in our opinion directly affects the freedom of trade as contemplated by Art provides that trade shall be free throughout the territory of India primarily it is the movement part of the trade that it has in mind and the movement or the transport part of trade must be free subject of course to the limitations and exceptions provided by the other Articles of Part XIII Does that mean that all tax laws attract the provisions of Part XIII whether their impact on trade or its movement is direct and immediate or indirect and remote It is precisely because the words used in Art However in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution we must always bear in mind that the relevant provision has to be read not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on another we must therefore have regard to the general scheme of our Constitution as well as the particular provisions in regard to taxing laws would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immediately restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art a rational and workable test to apply would be Does the impugned restriction operate directly or immediately on trade or its A provides that trade shall be free throughout the territory of India it means that the flow of trade shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at the boundaries of the States or at any other points inside the States themselves It is the free movement or the transport of goods from one part of the country to the other that is intended to be saved and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the very movement of such goods it attracts the provisions of Art and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of Art and passes a law imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade in the public interest whether or not the given law is in the public interest may not be justiciable and in that sense <ORG> is given the sole power to decide what restrictions can be imposed in public interest as authorised by Art As we have already pointed out the Act has been passed providing for the levy of tax on certain goods carried by roads or inland waterways in the State of Assam It also makes similar provisions for jute with which we are not concerned in the present proceedings Section provides for taxing authorities and their powers Section makes a provision for licensing of balers who are persons owning or possessing pressing machines for the compression of jute into bales Section deals with the assessment in cases of evasion and escape with rectification and with penalty for non submission of returns and evasion of taxes This Act has been passed by <ORG> under Entry in List and naturally it purports to be a tax on goods carried by roads or by inland waterways As we have made it clear during the course of this judgment we do not propose to express any Opinion as to the possible consequence of the view which we are taking in the present proceedings We are dealing in the present case with an Act passed by <ORG> which imposes a restriction in the form of taxation on the carriage or movement of goods and we hold that such a restriction can be imposed by <ORG> only if the relevant Act is passed in the manner prescribed by Art Now what does an act passed under the said Entry purport to do It purports to put a restraint in the form of taxation on the movement of trade and if the movement of trade is regarded as an integral part of trade itself the Act in substance puts a restriction on trade itself It is no doubt true that the points which arose for decision in those cases had reference to the fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts or but we are referring to those decisions in order to emphasise that the test there adopted would in the present case lead to the conclusion that the Act with which we are concerned is invalid The challenge to the Act proceeded on two grounds that it violated the fundamental right guaranteed under Art These observations would indicate that the test of pith and substance is generally and more appropriately applied when a dispute arises as to the legislative competence of the legislature and it has to be resolved by reference to the entries to which the impugned legislation is relatable When there is a conflict between two entries in the legislative lists and legislation by reference to one entry would be competent but not by reference to the other the doctrine of pith and substance is invoked for the purpose of determining the true nature and character of the legislation in question Vide <NAME> <ORG> Khulna and <NAME> <NAME> We may in that connection refer to two of such decisions at this stage were declared to be unconstitutional on two other grounds which had no direct connection with the challenge under Part XIII of the Constitution To the same effect are some of the observations made by <NAME> in the case of <NAME> In this connection we have already referred to the note of warning struck by <NAME> against indiscriminate reliance being placed on Australian and American decisions in interpreting our Constitution in the case of <NAME> Co Even so the reported decisions of this Court show that in dealing with constitutional problems reference has not infrequently been made to Australian and American decisions and that we think brings out the characteristic feature of the working of the judicial process It is to the observations made by <ORG> in the last case to which we wish to refer Referring to the word free used in the said section Lord <NAME> observed that the said word in itself is vague and indeterminate it must take its colour from the context In the result we hold that the Act has put a direct restriction on the freedom of trade and since in doing so it has not complied with the provisions of Art Section provides that every producer and dealer shall furnish a return of manufactured tea carried in chests In terms the tax imposed by the Act is a tax on goods carried by road and inland waterways and is not of the nature of a duty of excise Article cl of the Constitution expressly provides that the legislative powers of the <ORG> and the <ORG> Legisla tures to make laws are subject to the provisions of the Constitution and Art of the Constitution the power to tax can be exercised by authority of law alone and the Constitution affirmatively grants the power of taxation under diverse heads under the three lists of the seventh schedule The basic principle underlying Art These observations made in the context of a guarantee against obstruction to the flow of interstate trade and commerce involved the conception of freedom from customs duties imports border prohibitions and restrictions of every kind the people were to be free to trade with each other and to pass to and fro among the <ORG>s without any burden hindrance or restriction based merely on the fact that they were not members of the same <ORG> is however not absolute it is subject to the provisions contained in Part XIII of the Constitution The learned Attorney General urged that the courts are incompetent to adjudge whether the quantum and the incidence of a tax imposed by a <ORG> in exercise of its powers are in the public interest and therefore it must be inferred that Arts That the courts may not in adjudging upon the validity of a restriction imposed by a parliamentary statute lightly enter upon an investigation whether the amount sought to be recovered and its incidence are in the public interest is not a ground for holding that Art Why the Constitution should have enacted that the <ORG>ary law may impose restrictions as may be required in the public interest and the <ORG> law may impose reasonable restrictions as may be required in the public interest it is difficult to appreciate It is unnecessary for the purpose of these cases to enter upon a discussion whether there is any real distinction between the quality of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation by the <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG>s exercising authority respectively under Arts The authority of the <ORG> <ORG> to enact legislation imposing restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse is therefore subject to the condition that before the Bill or amendment of a statute is moved the previous sanction of the President must be obtained Legislative power of the <ORG> imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse may therefore be validly exercised if the restrictions are required in the public interest and to the <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG>s to make laws imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse prohibition is imposed on the exercise of the power in making laws giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one <ORG> over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one <ORG> and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the seventh schedule The expression relating to trade and commerce used in Art in my judgment includes all those entries in the lists of the seventh schedule which deal with the power to legislate directly or indirectly in respect of activities in the nature of trade and commerce <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other <ORG>s or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced pose tax on the import of goods to which similar goods manufactured or produced in the <ORG> are subject provided that by taxing the goods imported from another <ORG> or <ORG> territory no discrimination is practised There is however no such condition imposed in the matter of enactment of laws imposing non discriminative tariffs under el Article protects existing laws except in so far as the President may by order or otherwise direct and it also validates certain enactments made before the commencement of the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act and authorises the <ORG> and <ORG> in future to make laws relating to matters referred to in sub cl The marginal note of the Article refers to the power of the States specified in Part of the First Schedule to levy tax as a power to
