The Plaintiff is proprietor of trade mark <ORG> which is registered under No dated June in Class in respect of the pharmaccu ticals preparation The application of the Defendant is filed under No on March and is still pending The new product of the Defendant was marketed and sold under the trade mark Betalong and the first sale thereof took place on December It is further the case of the Defendant that there are a number of similar products in the market which are sold under the trade marks beginning which the word Beta It is the case of the Defendant that the letters loc which form the other part of the Plaintiff trade mark Betaloc do not convey any idea nor do they have any meaning in the English language Definition and interpretation deceptively similar A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff has submitted that for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the <ORG> have laid down that the following factors should be taken into consideration Mr <NAME> has further submitted that weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depends on facts of each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each factor in every case In support of his submission Mr <NAME> has relied upon the case of <ORG> <NAME> where it has been held that the said Act does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion within the meaning of Section a and Section and therefore evey case must depend on its own particular facts and the value of the authority lies not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion <ORG> has further held that the absolute identity of the two competitive marks or their close resemblance is only one of the tests for determining the question of likelihood of deception or confusion On the fads of that case it was held that the first syllable Eg could not be disregarded because it had some relation to the nature of the goods but that in such cases the totality of the two marks must be considered that Egall was so similar to Egrol as to make confusion likely In that case the appellants had applied for registration of the trade mark Protovit The appellants thereafter used that mark on multi vitamin preparations in liquid and tablet forms and their goods were sold under that mark since the year The matter was taken in appeal to this Court The appellants then preferred an appeal under Letters Patent but the appeal was dismissed by <ORG> of this Court Before <ORG> the appeal was brought by certificate from the judgment of this Court in the appeal While considering the test for comparison of the two words marks for mualted by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> application RPC <ORG> has held as under at of AIR It is also important that the marks must be compared as a whole It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion The Registrar found that although the marks viewed side by side or compared phonetically were not confusingly similar nevertheless there was a reasonable probability of confusion taking into account imperfect recollection and the fact that both the applicants and the opponents marks would be used in very small letters on the faces of watches <ORG> held i that as the mark applied for and the opponents marks were invented words it was not proper to disregard such elements of the words which were deceptive and therefore the question of likelihood of confusion had to be decided by a comparison of the marks as a whole ii that on comparison of the marks it appeared that there was a likelihood of confusion which the applicants who had not used their mark had been able to dispel by evidence In this connection Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel appearing for the Defendant has submitted that where there are several marks with common prefix proper attention should be given to the termination of the marks It was inter alia held in that case that despite common prefix Rheuma there were special factors in that case winch ruled out any likelihood of confusion in particular the attention which laboratory staff would be likely to pay to the terminations of the marks when ordering diagnostic preparations The said application was opposed by <ORG> on the grounds inter alia that the word Dustic was not an invented word being merely a misspelling of Does stick that the word had direct reference to the character or quality of the goods and that it was liable to be confused with other registered marks and in particular with the mark Bostik registered by the opponents therein for certain classes of adhesives The words are so similar that there is reasonable probability of confusion between the words both from the visual and phonetic point of view In its reply the defendants therein contended that the two trade marks Calmpose and Calmprose were phonetically different and that in any case since the medicine could be sold by chemists only on the written prescription of a registered medical practitioner there could be little likelihood of deception or confusion arising by the use of the marks I see no reason why the said decision has no applicability to the facts of the present case Mr <NAME> has submitted that since medicines could be sold by the chemists only on written prescription of a registered medical practitioner there is no likelihood of confusion or deception by use of both the said marks In that case a notice of motion was taken out by the plaintiffs who are a very wellknown company manufacturing drugs for an injunction restraining the defendants therein pending the hearing and final disposal of the suit from using in relation to certain pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations labels and cartons deceptively similar to the articles and cartons of the plaintiffs so as to pass off the defendants goods and products as and for the goods and products of the plaintiffs as well as for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from printing and using the said labels and cartons so as to constitute an infringement of the plaintiffs copyright in the artistic work contained in their correspondence Mr <NAME> has then submitted that the class of persons to use the goods and the nature of goods as also the mode of purchase are the factors which are to be taken into consideration in deciding as to likelihood of confusion or deception being caused by the use of the marks who were carrying on like business filed an application for registration their name the mark Ciplamina proposed to be used by them in respect of pharmaceulical and medicinal preparatio The said application was opposed on the ground that the proposed mark was deceptively similar to the said registered mark On the facts of the said case it was held that there was no deceptive similarity between the said two marks It was also held in that case tha there was phonetic dissimilarity between the two words While putting reliance on the case of <ORG> in RPC Mr <NAME> submitted that doctors and pharmacists were trained to take very great care in their work and if in doubt to check before acting and since the medicines are to be dispensed on medical preparations there is no likelihood of any confusion being caused The defendants therein while admitting the likelihood of confusion and deception sought analogus injunctive relief against the plaintiffs It was held i that in relation fo the two products as presently marketed there had been no actual confusion and there was no likelihood of confusion as doctors and pharmacists were trained to take very great care in their work and if in doubt to check before acting ii that a real likelihood of confusion would only arise if the defendants produced and marketed a solid formulation of their product iii that the defendants might produce a solid formulation of De nol was when the plaintiff introduced their products no more than a limited possibility Defendant No <ORG> was a firm carrying on manufacture and business of medical preparations at Kota Rajasthan with an office in Kandivali The suit was therefore filed by the plaintiffs for infringement and application for ad interim injunction was therein made which was granted of the rival strips and cartons were identical ii that the defendants were using the infringing mark and deceptive cartons with a view to trading on the plaintiffs reputation and their contention that there could not be any deception since the medicines needed doctor prescription was not acceptable as the defendants mark and phonetically similar to the plaintiffs mark In India scheduled drugs which are to be sold under doctor prescriplion are even sold without production of doctor prescription and as such reduces the weightage that can be given to this aspect of the matter while considering the question of deceptive similarity In case where the fact of the medicines being sold on doctror prescription has been taken into consideration for deciding the there was no likelihood of confusion being created the marks were not visually phonetically and structurally similar In the instant case the two marks Betaloc and Betalong being visually phonetically and structurally similar and so close to each other that it outweighs the weightage to be given to the factor that the goods are scheduled drugs In that case the registration of the trade mark Prilex was allowed since the petitioners product Pilex is an ayurvedic product and the st respondents products Prilex is an allopathic product and that the st respondents product being schedule drug could only be available against prescription under the Drugs Rules In the circumstances of the case it was held that there was no possibility of confusion and or deception Mr <NAME> has then submitted that the mark Betalong has been honestly adopted by the defendants and as such there is no question of defendants being injuncted In that case the appellants sought an injunction to restrain the respondents from using the trade mark Slimex Mr <NAME> has lastly submitted that the Defendant is in the market since the year and the suit has been filed by the Plaintiff on September and as such the Plaintiff is guilty of gross delay in approaching this Court and therefore not entitled to any interim relief from this Court Since there was no compliance by the Defendant a further notice by way of reminder was served upon the Defendant on March and the suit was thereafter filed Accordingly there is no delay on the part of the Plaintiff in approaching this Court
