of the Constitution of India from a judgment dated nd August of <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> in Miscellaneous Judicial Cases Nos and of the Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> are five companion appeals from the judgment of <ORG> at Orissa delivered on five petitions filed by the respondent in each of the appeals to obtain from the Court a writ of mandamus and or directions under article of the Constitution of India It is however common ground that there was no registered lease in favour of any of the respondents before In pursuance of the exercise of the powers conferred on <ORG> by section of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act read with Notifica tion No dated rd March of <ORG> <ORG> issued a notification dated the th of June declaring inter alia the said leases to be void and not binding on it On the rd July however they passed an order cancelling the temporary per mits and directed the respondents to remove their assets appertaining to the respective mines within a fortnight The respondents thereupon filed the petitions before <ORG> praying for writs or directions in the nature of mandamus against the State of Orissa directing them to withdraw the notices dated the th of June and rd of July and to forbear from acting upon or giving effect to the same I am however satisfied that in the context of events and in the logic of circumstances attending thereto there is a case to be tried He next considered the scope of the writ of mandamus and came to the conclusion that at the moment the respondents had no alternative legal remedy equally conven ient beneficial and effectual because the respondents could not file a suit till after the expiry of the period of sixty days required for the purpose under section of the Civil Procedure Code and he thought that unless protected by the <ORG> in the meanwhile the respondents would undergo irrepa rable and irremediable loss of possession of the mining leases involving a huge waste of labour machinery and other resources of equipments of immense value hardly capable of being remedied by payments of money as compensation The Bench therefore passed an order dated nd August as follows We direct that till three months from today or one week after the institution of their respondents contemplated suit whichever is earlier the <ORG> of the <ORG> of Orissa should refrain from disturbing the petitioners possession over the mining areas in question and that thereafter this order will cease to have effect He stated that although he was reluctant to exercise the powers under article because the present respondents could file a suit yet as in view of section of the Civil Procedure Code there would be an unavoidable delay resulting in irreparable loss to the respondents he agreed that the order should be passed as mentioned in the judgment of the Chief Justice Towards the end of his judgment he stated as follows It should however be clearly emphasized that the observations contained in this judgment should not be taken as pre judg ing any question which may arise for the consideration of the Civil <ORG> in the event of the petitioners filing a regular suit and seeking interim relief from that <ORG> by way of temporary injunction appointment of receiver or otherwise If such an application is made the questions as to whether the petitioners have a prima facie case for trial or whether such a suit is maintainable or whether the bal ance of convenience requires that they should be permitted to remain in possession of the leasehold property till the termination of the suit and other allied matters should all be dealt with by the <ORG> concerned without being influ enced in any way by the observations contained in this judgment The State of Orissa has come on appeal to us and after hearing the arguments on both sides we came to the conclusion that the order of <ORG> could not be sustained We accordingly passed the following order on the th of October These five appeals are allowed and the order of <ORG> is set aside in each case As <ORG> has passed no other orders on the petitions The respondents will pay the costs of the ap peals Notwithstanding anything in article <ORG> shall have power throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> within those territories directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari or any of them for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose The power conferred on <ORG> by clause shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on <ORG> by clause of article The language of the Article shows that the issuing of writs or directions by the <ORG> is not rounded only on its decision that a right of the aggrieved party under Part II of the Constitution Fundamental Rights has been in fringed The whole judgment shows that because of the requirement of section of the Civil Procedure Code the present respondents could not file a suit against the Government for at least sixty days the respondent position should not in the interval be dis turbed and accordingly the <ORG> gave the directions in its order of the nd of August If there was any doubt about the nature of the relief desired to be granted by the order of nd August the same Judges have made it per fectly clear by their order of the th of August wherein they have stated that except for these directions they were not prepared to make any other order on the petitions The result therefore is that while the Judges declined to inves tigate and pronounce on the rights of the parties and ex pressly kept the determination thereof in abeyance in the suit proposed to be filed by the present respondents they gave directions for interim relief till such suit was filed It must be noted that with the passing of the order of the nd August containing directions in the nature of interim relief the petitions were completely disposed of and have not been kept pending for disposal Those directions embody therefore the final order passed by the <ORG> on these petitions A preliminary objection was raised about the maintainability of the appeals on the ground that no final orders were passed on the petitions On behalf of the appellant it was urged that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass such orders under article under the circumstances of the case If the <ORG> was of opinion that there was no other convenient or adequate remedy open to the petitioners it might have proceeded to investigate the case on its merits and come to a decision as to whether the petitioners suc ceeded in establishing that there was an infringement of any of their legal rights which entitled them to a writ of mandamus or any other directions of a like nature and pending such determination it might have made a suitable interim order for maintaining the status quo ante
