This is a group of applications made by the petitioners in various writ petitions for directions regarding discharge of batik guarantees given by them pursuant to interim orders made by this <ORG> in the writ petitions When the writ petitions were admitted an application was made by the petitioners in each writ petition for stay of the operation of the Levy Sugar Supply Control Order and this <ORG> made an interim order on each of the applications staying the operation of the Levy Sugar Supply Control Order on the petitioners in the respective writ petitions furnishing a bank guarantee in respect of the difference between the price at which the sugar is actually sold and it was provided in each of these Orders that such bank guarantees shall be furnished to the satisfaction of the Registrar of this <ORG> every month in respect of the transactions of that month within four week the actual sales of that month and that this <ORG> shall deal with such bant guarantee is to how such amount is to be distributed or paid The writ petitions were ultimately dismissed by this <ORG> by a judgment delivered on th November but during this period unfortunately by reason of the interim orders of stay granted by this <ORG> the petitioners who are manufacturers of sugar were able to funnel into their pockets large sums of money to the detriment of the small consumers There is no doubt that each consumer who had to pay more than the controlled price was entitled to recover the excess paid by him from the dealer who sold the sugar to him and the dealer in his turn was entitled to recover the excess paid by him from the petitioners but it would be well nigh impossible for the small consumer to litigate for his little sum with the dealer or the petitioners There applications could not be disposed of for a long time and whilst they were pending the Act was brought into force and hence these applications have now to be disposed of in the light of the provisions contained in the Act The Act came into force on th February and it was enacted to provide for the establishment in the interest of the general public of a fund to ensure that the price of the levy sugar may be uniform throughout India and matter connected there with or incidental thereto Then there were other provisions in regard to the vesting of the <ORG> in <ORG> and its dissolution as also certain other incidental provisions The result is that where by virtue of any interim order made by any court whether before or after the commencement of the Act any excess realisations are collected kept by a producer under the cover of any guarantee given in pursuance of such interim order he is exonerated from the obligation to credit the amount of such excess realisations to the Fund so long as the court which passed the interim order does not so direct But obviously Sub section and can operate only where an interim order made by a court is Subsisting at the date of commencement of the Act or is Subsequently made because they carve an exception out of Sub section and relieve the producer from the obligation to credit the amount of excess realisations to the Fund within the period specified in Sub section and postpone this obligation to the point of time when the court which has passed the interim order so directs or the proceedings before the court finally come to an end These Sub sections can have no application where an interim order made by a court has already come to an a end as a result of final disposal of the proceedings before the commencement of the Act We direct that so far as the petitioners in applications other than Nos of of of and of are concerned the amounts of excess realisations together with interest be paid by them to the credit of the <ORG> in three equal instalments one on or before st January the other on or before st January and the third on or before st January If the petitioners commit default in payment of any instalment on its due date the whole of the amount of excess realisations together with interest or the balance thereof then remaining due shall become payable forthwith by the petitioners to the credit of the <ORG> The balance of the amount of excess realisations together with interest if any will be paid by the petitioners within three months from today So far as the petitioners in No of are concerned the amount of excess realisations together with interest shall be paid by them to the credit of the <ORG> in three equal instalments one on or before st January the other on or before st January and the Third on or before st January and in the meantime the bank guarantee given by them will continue and it will be renewed from time to time at least three months before each expiry date until the whole amount is paid off by the petitioners If there is any balance out of the amount of excess realisations which remains to be paid by the petitioners the same will be paid by them in two equal instalments one on or before st January and the other on or before st January with a default Clause in the same terms as in the case of other applications We are hold that the petitioners in some of the applications have filed writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Act and some of the writ petitions are pending in <ORG> while in some others appeals are pending in this Court
