The respondent filed No of for the eviction of the appellant but before he could obtain a decree the Non Residential Building Rent Control Order had been amended on nth July The matter was taken in appeal to the Subordinate Judge who affirmed the decision of the trial <ORG> The learned Judge held that despite the passing of the amendment on the th July the law to be applied to the case was the law as it existed at the date of filing the suit He therefore allowed the appeal with costs throughout Clause says A tenant in possession of a non residential building shall not be evicted therefrom whether in execution of a decree or otherwise except in accordance with the provisions of this clause As there are no provisions in this clause for the eviction of the tenant on the grounds raised in the suit it is clear that if this sub clause be taken at its face value the tenant could not be evicted even though a decree had been obtained Sub clause makes the matter even clearer because the procedure to be adopted by a landlord who desires to evict his tenant is not to apply to <ORG> in execution of his decree but to <ORG> for a direction that the tenant be evicted The Con roller has then after giving the tenant a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the application to consider whether the tenant has been guilty of any of the laches or defaults referred to in the various paragraphs of Sub clause The difficulty which the learned Judge felt in giving Clause its plain interpretation was that to do so would be to infringe the principle that a new legislation should not affect existing rights unless the wording of the statute makes it clear expressly or by necessary implication that it is to have retrospective effect The execution proceedings were filed long after the amendment came into force Mr <NAME> has been constrained to argue that the moment a person files a suit he obtains thereby a vested right to have applied not only to the suit but to all execution proceedings also the law relating to execution as it existed at the time of filing the suit We know of no such principle and we find no reason to think from the cases that have been cited before us that if a new law is introduced restricting the right to execute execution proceedings can nevertheless be instituted if such a right existed on the date of the filing of the suit in which reference is made to certain English cases interpreting British Statutes said to be similar to the Statute here under consideration but we have not seen those decisions or those Statutes and we are not at all convinced that any such general principle exists The learned judge in attempting to reconcile the new amendment with the principle leaning against giving retrospective effect to new legislation was inclined to think that the words in execution of a decree can only be applied to suits instituted after the nth July It seem to us however that no suits could be instituted after that date for by the new Act a landlord desirous of evicting his tenant would not file a suit but would apply directly to the Rent Controller who would then proceed to hear the objections of the tenant and to decide the case in accordance with the principles laid down in Clause That case can clearly be distinguished because as we have already said we are not here concerned with the applicability of the new law to pending proceedings and we do not find from <NAME>t judgment any principle laid down that could usefully be applied to this case except the well recognised one that one should not apply a new law to divest a person of his vested rights unless by express or necessary implication the new law is made by the <ORG> to do so In summing up <NAME>t said If and when an application for possession comes before the Controller the Controller should apply his mind to the circumstances actually and presently before him to enable him to make or refuse an order and it would be for one side or the other to point out that the application for ejectment had lost its force owing to the fact that since the application had been made difficulties which were then not in existence had arisen or difficulties that were in existence had disappeared It is seen from this passage that the learned Judge far from thinking that the landlord had by the institution of his application for possession in the Sub Court acquired an absolute right to physical possession contemplated proceedings before the Rent Controller in which it would be contended by the tenant that in view of the new legislation actual possession could not be given <NAME> also referred to certain passages in the judgment of <NAME> in the <ORG> case referred to and said <NAME> points out that unless either expressly or by necessary intendment it is made out in the new legislation that it applies to pending proceedings as well it ought not to be construed to have retrospective operation so as to affect the rights of parties in pending suits With respect we agree with this observation but as we have already pointed out we are not concerned here with pending proceedings We are not prepared to say that during the period between the passing of the decree and the filing of the execution petition there were any pending proceedings We are only concerned here with the right of the respondent to execute his decree and we are of opinion that Clause prohibited him from filing an execution petition in the <ORG> his only way of evicting the tenant being to file an application before the Rent Controller The appeal is therefore allowed and the decrees of <ORG> and of the first appellate Court restored
