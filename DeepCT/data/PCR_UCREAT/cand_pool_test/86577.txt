The application has been opposed on behalf of the opposite party on two technical grounds namely It is contended on behalf of the opposite party that the application is barred by limitation for two reasons Articles and of the Constitution provide for appeal to <ORG> from any judgment decree or final order of <ORG> In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal an application for leave to appeal and an application for a review of judgment the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree sentence or order appealed from or sought to be reviewed shall be excluded Where a decree is appealed from or sought to be reviewed the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the judgment on which it is founded shall also be excluded The contention on behalf of the opposite party is that this case is covered by Section arid the time taken in obtaining a copy of the judgment cannot be excluded There is difference of opinion among the various <ORG> as to whether the time taken in obtaining copy of the judgment can be excluded in cases of application for leave to appeal Some <ORG> as for example Allahabad have held that as Sub section expressly contains the words application for leave to appeal while Sub section does not the time spent in obtaining copy of the Judgment cannot be allowed in cases of applications for leave Other <ORG> have held that time taken in obtaining a copy of the judgment can be allowed under Sub section Vide In re Secy of State A I Mad We do not think it necessary to decide in the present case whether time for obtaining a copy of the judgment can be excluded in a case where there is a judgment as well as a decree following it The present is a case in our opinion where there is no decree following the judgment of this Court In cases under Article there is no decree We are therefore of opinion that in cases covered by Article the Judgment itself is the order to be appealed from and the time taken in obtaining copy of the judgment has to be excluded Once the time taken in obtaining the copy of the judgment is excluded it is admitted that the application for leave to appeal was filed within time As to the contention that in any case the application was barred by time as against Mitha lal it is enough to say that we accept the explanation that the name of <NAME> was left out by oversight from the application which was filed on the th January We therefore condone the delay under the circumstances under Section of the Limitation Act We therefore reject the technical objections raised on behalf of the opposite party and order that a certificate be granted as prayed under Articles and of the Constitution In view of the technical defects in the case we order parties to bear their own costs of the present application
