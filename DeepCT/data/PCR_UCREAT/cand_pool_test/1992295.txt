No of Section Constitutionality of Whether <ORG> has the power to make rules under section to enable them to charge dead rent and roya<ORG>y during the subsistence of such leases Validity of Notifications circular issued by the Gujarat <ORG> under section amending the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules and dated and Validity of Rule of the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules In exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act <ORG> made the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules The said Rules came into force on April The Appellant in A <NAME> being aggrieved by the said Notification filed a Writ Petition in <ORG> Sp Ap challenging the enhancement in the rate of roya<ORG>y to Rs per metric tonne in respect of black trap and hard Murrum specified in Item of the said substituted Schedule I The Writ Petition having been dismissed the appellant filed LPA No which was heard along with several writ petitions raising the same questions A subsidiary contention raised was that <ORG> had no power to classify building stones into black trap and hard murrum because by doing so what <ORG> had done in effect and substance was to declare black trap and hard murrum as minor minerals and that it was only the Central <ORG> which possessed the power to declare any mineral not covered by the definition of the expression minor minerals in clause of section of the Act to be a minor mineral Both these contentions were rejected by a Division Bench of <ORG> by its judgment dated September holding that the Notification had not become operative and therefore in issuing the Notification <ORG> had not violated the proviso to section and that building stones having been already included in the definition of minor minerals there was no bar to <ORG> classifying them into different varieties for the purpose of recovering roya<ORG>y The said Letters Patent Appeal and other writ petition challenging the Notification were allowed by <ORG> The <ORG> thereafter made the Gujarat Minor Minerals Amendment Rules by issuing the Notification which came into force on June Several lessees of mining and quarry leases filed writ petitions in <ORG> challenging the validity of the Notification and the said Circular These writ petitions were rejected on the ground that as connected proceedings were pending in <ORG> it was open to the petitioners to move this <ORG> if they so desired Accordingly the said petitioners as also others filed writ petitions in this <ORG> challenging the validity of the Notification and the said Circular as also in some cases Appeals against the order rejecting the writ petitions The Act is made in exercise of the powers conferred by Entry in the <ORG> List which speaks both of regulation of mines and minerals development and Entry in the <ORG> List is subject to Entry The rule making power conferred by section was for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases and for purposes connected therewith prior to the Amendment Act of and thereafter is for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases and other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith The phraseology of section is the same as that of section which confers rule making power upon the Central <ORG> with this difference that by the Amendment Act of the expression quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions has been substituted in section for the words prospecting licences and mining leases while the expression prospecting licences and mining leases in section remains unchanged Each of these provisions confers the power to make rules for regulating me power to regulate conferred by sections and is not only with respect to the grant of licences and leases mentioned in those sub sections but is also with respect to purposes connected therewith that is purposes connected with such grant When the Act came to be enacted <ORG> knew that different <ORG> <ORG>s had in pursuance of the provisions of Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules made rules for regulating the grant of leases in respect of minor minerals and other matters connected therewith and for this reason it expressly provided in sub section of section of the Act that the rules in force immediately before the commencement of that Act would continue in force until superseded by rules made under sub section of section A A There are sufficient guidelines provided in the Art for the exercise of the rule making Power of the <ORG> <ORG>s under section of the Act These guidelines are to be found in the object for which such power is conferred namely for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith the meaning of the word regulating the scope of the phrase for purposes connected therewith the illustrative matters set out in sub section of section and the restrictions and other matters contained in sections to of the Act A It is well settled that where a statute confers particular powers without prejudice to the generality of a general power already conferred the particular powers are only illustrative of the general power and do not in any way restrict the general power The fact that provision similar to sub section of section does not find a place in section does not make any difference What sub section of section does it to give illustrations of the matters in respect of which the Central <ORG> can make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith The opening clause of sub section of section namely In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power makes it clear that the topics set out in that sub section are already included in the general power conferred by sub section but are being listed to particularize them and to focus attention on them The particular matters in respect of which the Central <ORG> can make rules under sub section of section are therefore also matters with respect to which under sub section of section <ORG> can make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith Sections to form a group of sections under the heading General restrictions on undertaking prospecting and mining operations The exclusion of the application of these sections to minor minerals means that these restrictions will not apply to minor minerals but that it is left to <ORG>s to prescribe such restrictions as they think fit by rules made under section In providing that section will not apply to quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals what was done was to take away from the Central <ORG> the power to make rules in respect of minor minerals and to confer that power by section upon <ORG>s The ambit of the power under section and under section is however the same the only difference being that in one case it is the Central <ORG> which exercises the power in respect of minerals other than minor minerals while in the other case it is <ORG>s which do so in respect of minor minerals Sub section of section which is illustrative of the general power conferred by section contains sufficient guidelines for <ORG>s to follow in framing the rules under section and in the same way <ORG>s have before them the restrictions and other matters provided for in sections to while framing their own rules under section The power to make rules conferred by section includes the power to make rules charging dead rent and roya<ORG>y Section of the Transfer of Property Act contains the definitions of the terms lease lessor lessee premium and rent Since a mining lease confers upon the lessee the right not merely to enjoy the property as under an ordinary lea but also to extract minerals from the land and to appropriate them for his own use or benefit in addition to the usual rent for the area demised the lessee is required to pay a certain amount in respect of the minerals extracted proportionate to the quantity so extracted In order to ensure for the lessor a regular income whether the mine is worked or not a fixed amount is provided to be paid to him by the lessee The power to make rules for regulating the grant of such leases would therefore include the power to fix the confederation parable br the lessee to the lessor in the shape of ordinary rent or surface rent dead rent and roya<ORG>y Rules for regulating the grant of mining leases cannot be confined merely to rules providing for the form in which applications for such leases are to be made the factors to be taken into account in granting or refusing such applications and other cognate matters Such rules must necessarily include provisions with respect to the consideration for the grant The <ORG> and the rule making authorities have also throughout understood the power to make rules in respect of mining leases and minerals as including the power to charge dead rent and roya<ORG>y Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules made by the Central <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Act prescribed the conditions which were to be included in every mining lease The said Rule provided for payment of roya<ORG>y on minerals at the rate specified in the First Schedule to the said Rules in force on the date of the grant of the lease as also to pay roya<ORG>y at such revised rates as may be notified from time to time It also provided for payment of surface rent and further provided for payment of dead rent with a proviso that the lessee was liable to pay dead rent or roya<ORG>y whichever was higher in amount but not both Rules made by <ORG>s in respect of minor minerals also provided for payment of these charges Under clause of section of the Act the rules to be made by the Central <ORG> can provide for the fixing and the collection of dead rent fines fees or other charges and the collection of roya<ORG>ies The reason was that a separate provision in that behalf was made by section with respect to mining leases granted both before the commencement of the Act as also after the commencement of the Act A The sole repository of the power of <ORG> to make rules and amendments thereto including amendments enhancing the rates of roya<ORG>y and dead rent is sub section of section Sub section of section does not confer upon <ORG>s the power to make rules charging roya<ORG>y or to enhance the rate of roya<ORG>y so charged from time to time A A proper reading of subsection of section shows that it does not confer any power upon <ORG>s to make rules with respect to roya<ORG>y Roya<ORG>y is payable by the holder of a quarry lease or mining lease or other mineral concession granted under rules made under sub section of section Yet another purpose of enacting sub section is to be found in the proviso to that sub section which prohibits <ORG> from enhancing the rate of roya<ORG>y in respect of any minor mineral for more than once during any period of four years It casts a liability upon the holder of a mining lease whether granted before or after the commencement of the Act that is either before or after September to pay to <ORG> teat rent at the rates specified for the time being in the Third Schedule to the Act notwithstanding anything contained in the instrument of lease or in any other law for the time being in force The power to make rules under section includes the power to amend the rules so made including the power to amend the rules so as to enhance the rates of roya<ORG>y and dead rent Rules under section though made by <ORG>s are rules made under a Central Act and the provisions of the General Clauses Act apply to such rules Under section of the General Clauses Act where by any Central Act a power to make rules is conferred then that power includes a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions if any to add to amend vary or rescind any rules so made The power to amend the rules is therefore comprehended within the power to make rules and as section confers upon <ORG>s the power to make rules providing for payment of dead rent and roya<ORG>y it also confers upon <ORG>s the power to amend those rules so as to a<ORG>er the rates of roya<ORG>y and dead rent so prescribed either by enhancing or reducing such rates A <ORG> <ORG> is entitled to amend the rules under section enhancing the rates of roya<ORG>y and dead rent even as regards leases subsisting at the date of such amendment A Sub section of section does not confer any power to amend the rules made under section for the power to amend the rules is comprehended within the power to make the rules conferred by sub section of section Ordinary leases of immovable property at times provide for periodic increases of rent and there is no reason why such increases should not be made in a mining or quarry lease or other mineral concession granted under a regulatory statute intended for the benefit of the public and even less reason why such a statute should not confer power to make rules providing for increases in the rate of dead rent during the subsistence of the lease In any event the power to make rules under section is also for purposes connected with the grant of mining and quarry leases and other mineral concessions and the expression and for purposes connected therewith read with the word grant would include the power to enhance the rate of test rent during the subsistence of the lease These leases and concessions are granted by <ORG>s pursuant to rules made under the statutory power conferred upon them by a regulatory Act In the exercise of the power conferred by Entry <ORG> has made a declaration in section of the Act that <ORG> is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided The presumption is that an authority clothed with a statutory power will exercise such power reasonably and if in the public interest and for the efficacious regulation of mines and quarries of minor minerals and the proper development of such minerals a <ORG> <ORG> as the delegate of the <ORG> <ORG> thinks fit to amend the rules to as to enhance the rate of dead rent it cannot be said that it is prevented from doing so by the principles of the ordinary law of contracts Where a statute confers discretionary powers upon the executive or an administrative authority the validity or constitutionality of such power cannot be judged on the assumption that the executive or such authority will act in an arbitrary manner in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon <ORG> If the executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute conferring the power or the power which has been conferred by <ORG> A <ORG> <ORG> is not required to give an opportunity of a hearing or of making a representation to the lessee who would be affected by any amendments of the rules before making such amendments The enhancement in the rates of roya<ORG>y and dead rent is made in the exercise of the statutory power to amend the rules framed under section There is no such principle of law that before such a statutory power is exercised persons who may be affected thereby should be heard Whether any opportunity is to be given to persons affected to make representations to the <ORG> would depend upon the form in which the rule making power is conferred It is for the legislative body which confers the rule making power to decide in what from such power should be conferred In some acts it is provided that the draft of the rules proposed to be made as also any proposed amendment thereto should be published in the Official Gazette so that members of the public may have an opportunity of making such representations or raising such objections as they think fit It was therefore for <ORG> to decide whether rules and notifications made by <ORG>s under section should be laid before <ORG> or the <ORG> of the state or not An amendment of the rules made under section even though <ORG> may have the effect of enhancing the rates of roya<ORG>y or dead rent does not therefore become bad in law because no opportunity of being heard or making a representation is given to persons who would be prejudicially affected thereby A<ORG>hough in one sense dead rent may partake of the nature of royal there is a substantial difference between both me bases for calculating roya<ORG>y and dead rent are different and they are dea<ORG> with in different provisions of Act namely sections and A so far as minerals other than minor minerals are concerned and in the Rules made by <ORG>s under section so far as minor minerals are concerned me period of four years for this purpose must be and can only be reckoned from the date of coming in to force of the rules and <ORG> is open to a <ORG> <ORG> to enhance the rate of roya<ORG>y or dead rent at any time once during the period of four years from the coming into force of the rules and after each period of four years expires at any time during each succeeding period of four years The enhancement in the rates of roya<ORG>y by the Notification was in the third period of four years reckoned from the date of coming into force of the Gujarat Rules namely from April Though section of the General Clauses Act does not in express terms refer to rules made under an Act the same principle of construction would apply in the case of rules made under an Act A Rule was not substituted for the purpose of conferring upon <ORG> the power to enhance the rates of roya<ORG>y specified in Schedule I It was substituted for a wholly different purpose namely to bring the said Rule in conformity with sub section Which was inserted with retrospective effect in section by the Amendment Act of In fact sub clause a of clause i of Rule and clause of Part of the Schedule to Form namely the From of Quarrying Lease appended to the Gujarat Rules expressly provided a condition that the lessee is to pay to the <ORG> roya<ORG>y at the rates for the time being specified in and in force under Schedule I to the Gujarat Rules The enhancement in the rates of dead rent made by the Notification does not amount to any unreasonable restrictions on the right of the holders of the quarry leases to carry on their trade or business The rates of dead rent specified cannot be looked at in isolation but in con junction with the drastic reduction ate in the rates of roya<ORG>y and so read there is nothing unreasonable in them A JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos of of of MADON This group of Writ Petitions under Article of the Constitution and Appeals by certificate granted by <ORG> and by Special Leave granted this Court raises questions relating to the constitutionality of section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act No of the power of the State Governments to make rules under the said section to enable them to charge dead rent and royalty in respect of leases of minor minerals granted by them and to enhance the rates of dead rent and royalty during the subsistence of such leases the validity of Rule of the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules and of certain notifications issued by <ORG> under the said section amending the said Rules so as to enhance the rates of royalty and dead rent in respect of leases of minor minerals In exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act <ORG> made the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules The said Rules came into force on April We may pause here to mention that the Appellant in Civil Appeal No of <NAME> filed a writ petition in <ORG> being Special Civil Application No of challenging the enhancement in the rate of royalty to Rs A subsidiary contention raised was that <ORG> had no power to classify building stones into black trap and hard murrum because by doing so what <ORG> had done in effect and substance was to declare black trap and hard murrum as minor minerals and that it was only the Central Government which possessed the power to declare any mineral not covered by the definition of the expression minor minerals in clause of section of the Act to be a minor mineral The Division Bench held that the Notification had not become operative and therefore in lssuing the Notification <ORG> had not violated the proviso to section and that building stones having been already included in the definition of minor minerals there was no bar to <ORG> classifying them into different varieties for the purpose of recovering royalty The <ORG> thereafter made the Gujarat Minor Mineral Amendment Rules by issuing the Notification which came into force on June Several lessees of mining and quarry leases filed writ petitions in <ORG> challenging the validity of the Notification and the said Circular These writ petitions were rejected on the ground that as connected proceedings were pending in this Court it was open to the petitioners to move this Court if they so desired Accordingly the said petitioners as also others have filed Writ Petitions in this Court challenging the validity of the Notification and the said Circular as also in some cases Appeals against the order rejecting the writ petitions There was no statute dealing with these matters prior to the enactment of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act No LIII of but they were governed by executive rules Regulation of mines and oilfields and mineral development to which such regulation and develop ment under <ORG> control is declared by <ORG> law to be expedient in the public interest The word Federal in the above entries was substituted by the word Dominion by the India Provisional Constitution Order Accordingly in pursuance of the power conferred by Entry in the Federal Legislative List <ORG> enacted on September the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The Act was brought into force on October by Notification No II I dated October published in <ORG> Extraordinary at page Section conferred power upon <ORG> to make rules to regulate the grant of mining leases or for prohibiting the grant of such leases in respect of any mineral or in any area Under clause of section in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by section such rules could provide for the fixing of the maximum and minimum rent payable by a lessee whether the mine is worked or not Section conferred power upon <ORG> to make rules for the conservation and development of minerals Under clause i of section in particular and without prejudice to the generality of The power conferred by section such rules could provide for the levy and collection of royalties fees or taxes in respect of minerals mined quarried excavated or collected Section conferred upon <ORG> the power to make rules for the purpose of modifying or altering the terms and conditions of any mining lease granted prior to the commencement of the Act so as to bring such lease in conformity with the rules made under section and In exercise of the power conferred by section of the Act <ORG> made the Mineral Concession Rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases for minerals other than petroleum and natural gas The said Rules came into force on October namely the date on which the Act was brought into force Rule of the said Rules expressly provided that the said Rules shall not apply to minor minerals the extraction of which shall be regulated by such rules as <ORG> may prescribe After the commencement of the Constitution by Notification No II dated October the word <ORG> was substituted by the word <ORG> The said definition in its finally amended form was as follows ii minor mineral means building stone boulder shingle gravel Chalcedony pebbles used for ball mill purposes only limeshell kankar and limestone used for lime burning murrum brick earth Fuller earth Bentonite ordinary clay ordinary sand used for non industrial purposes road metal reh matti slate and shale when used for building material Rule prescribed the conditions which every mining lease was to include Conditions Every mining lease shall include the following conditions i The lessee shall pay royalty on minerals despatched from the leased areas at the rate specified in the First Schedule to these rules as in force on the date of the grant of the lease Provided that the lessee pay royalty at such revised rate as may be notified from time to time Provided further that the rate of royalty shall not be revised more than once in two years nor it shall be in excess of twenty percent of the sale value of the mineral at the pit mouth Rule provided as follows A surface rent and dead rent or minimum Royalty at the rate specified in schedules and VI shall be recovered on all quarry materials permitted or licensed to be quarried and removed under Rule By Notification No MNL dated December <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred by Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules made the Bombay Minor Mineral Extraction Rules which came into force on June Rule prescribed the conditions which every quarrying lease was to include Every quarrying lease shall include the following

inflammable Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest The Act was brought into force on June by Notification No dated May published in <ORG> Extraordinary Part II sec A number of provisions which till then had been dealt with under the rule making powers of <ORG> were transferred to the Act in order to restrict the scope of subsidiary legislation Section of the Act contains a declaration that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided in the Act Certain definitions given in section are important and may be reproduced In this Act unless the context otherwise requires a minerals includes all minerals except mineral oils mining lease means a lease granted for the purpose of undertaking mining operations and includes a sub lease granted for such purpose mining operations means any operations undertaken for the purpose of winning any mineral minor minerals means building stones gravel ordinary clay ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes and any other mineral which <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette declare to be a minor mineral Under section A which was inserted by the Amendment Act of where in the interest of regulation of mines and mineral development it is thought expedient to grant a mining lease in favour of a <ORG> company or corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> and for that purpose to terminate prematurely a mining lease in respect of a mineral other than a minor mineral it is for <ORG> after consultation with the State <ORG> to form the opinion with respect to such expediency while it is for the State <ORG> after consultation with <ORG> to form the opinion with respect to such expediency in the case of a mining lease in respect of any minor mineral Section prescribes the period for which a prospecting licence can be granted or renewed and section prescribes the period for which a mining lease can be granted or renewed The holder of a mining lease granted before the commencement of this Act shall notwithstanding anything contained in the instrument of lease or in any law in force at such commencement pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his agent manager employee contractor or sub lessee from the leased area after such commencement at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral The holder of a mining lease granted on or after the commencement of this Act shall pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his agent manager employee contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral The Central Government may by notification in the Official Gazette amend the Second Schedule so as to enhance or reduce the rate at which royalty shall be payable in respect of any mineral with effect from such date as may specified in the notification Provided that <ORG> shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any mineral more than once during any period of four years The words mineral removed or consumed by him or his agent manager employee contractor or sub lessee were substituted in sub sections and by the Amendment Act of for the words mineral removed by him The Central Government may by notification in the Official Gazette amend the Third Schedule so as to enhance or reduce the rate at which the dead rent shall be payable in respect of any area covered by a mining lease and such enhancement or reduction shall take effect from such date as may be specified in the notification Provided that <ORG> shall not enhance the rate of the dead rent in respect of any such area more than once during any period of four Years Sections to prescribe the procedure for obtaining prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the <ORG> Sections to

the Amendment Act of for the words prospecting licences and mining leases Any prospecting licence or mining lease granted renewed or acquired in contravention of the provisions of this Act or any rules or orders made thereunder shall be void and of no effect Under section all rules made or purporting to have been made under the Act in so far as they related to matters for which provision was made in the Act and were not inconsistent therewith are to be deemed to have been made under the Act and to continue in force until superseded by any rules made under the Act In exercise of the power conferred by section of the Act <ORG> by Notification No dated November published in <ORG> dated November Part II sec Every mining lease shall be subject to the following conditions and such conditions shall be incorporated in every mining lease the lessee shall pay for every year except the first year of the lease such yearly dead rent within the limits specified in Schedule IV as may be fixed from time to time by <ORG> and if the lease permits the working of more than one mineral in the sale area <ORG> shall not charge separate dead rent in respect of each mineral Provided that the lessee shall be liable to pay the dead rent of royalty in respect of each mineral whichever be higher in amount but not both the lessee shall also pay for the surface area used by him for the purpose of mining operations surface rent and water rate at such rate not exceeding the land revenue water and cesses assessable on the land as may be specified by <ORG> in the lease If the lessee makes any default in payment of royalty as required by section or commits a breach of any of the conditions other than those referred to in sub rule <ORG> shall give notice to the lessee requiring him to pay the royalty or remedy the breach as the case may be within sixty days from the date of the notice and if the royalty is not paid or the breach is not remedied within such period <ORG> may without prejudice to any proceeding that may be taken against him determine the lease and forfeit the whole or part of the security deposit In exercise of the power conferred by section of the Act various <ORG> Governments have made rules in respect of minor minerals Although these rules vary from <ORG> to <ORG> there are certain broad features present in all of them In most of the <ORG> rules there is a provision for the grant of a permit to excavate a specified quantity of a minor mineral from a specified area within a prescribed time In some of the <ORG> rules there is also a provision for the grant of a prospecting licence All <ORG> rules which provide for payment of royalty and dead rent contain a provision that either dead rent or royalty whichever is higher in amount but not both would be payable In addition most <ORG> rules also contain a provision for the payment of surface rent The State of Gujarat however did not in the exercise of the power conferred by section of the Act make any rules for minor minerals until and until such rules were made the rules in force immediately before the commencement of the Act continued to apply in the State of Gujarat by virtue of the provisions of section It was submitted that the rule making power conferred upon the State Governments by section was an uncanalized power as no guidelines were prescribed for its exercise and thus it enabled the State Governments to act arbitrarily and as they liked with respect to leases of minor minerals The Act is made in exercise of the powers conferred by Entry in the <ORG> List In that case this <ORG> held that Entry in the <ORG> List speaks both of regulation of mines and mineral development and Entry in the <ORG> List is subject to Entry To what extent such a declaration can go is for <ORG> to determine and this must be commensurate with public interest but once such declaration is made and the extent of such regulation and development laid down the subject of the legislation to the extent so laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration which touches upon the field disclosed in the declaration would necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is extracted from the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legislature The <ORG> further held that the <ORG> had taken all the power in respect of minor minerals to itself and had authorized the <ORG> Governments to make rules for the regulation of leases and thus by the declaration made in section and the enactment of section the whole of the field relating to minor minerals came within the jurisdiction of <ORG> and there was no scope left to the <ORG> Legislatures to make any enactment with respect thereto The court also held that by giving the power to the <ORG> Governments to make rules the control of the <ORG> was not negatived but on the contrary it established that the <ORG> was exercising the control One of the contentions raised in that case was that section was unconstitutional as the delegation of legislative power made by it to the rule making authority was excessive The rule making power conferred by section was for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases and for purposes connected therewith prior to the Amendment Act of and thereafter is for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases and other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith The phraseology of section is the same as that of section which confers rule making power upon <ORG> with this difference that by the Amendment Act of the expression quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions has been substituted in section for the words prospecting licences and mining leases while the expression prospecting licences and mining leases in section remains unchanged The term minor minerals is however separately defined by clause because the power to make rules in respect thereof is vested by section in the State Governments while the power to make rules with respect to minerals other than minor minerals is vested in <ORG> The word minerals in different sections of the Act is used with the meaning assigned to it by clause a of section that is as denoting all minerals except mineral oils unless the context requires otherwise and where the Act wishes to make a distinction between minor minerals and minerals other than minor minerals it does so expressly To take another illustration under section any prospecting licence or mining lease granted renewed or acquired in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rules or orders made thereunder is to be void and of no effect Were it not so the result would be startling for while a prospecting licence or a mining lease in respect of minerals other than minor minerals would be void and of no effect if it is in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rules or orders made thereunder in the case of a prospecting licence or a mining lease in respect of minor minerals such licence or lease would not be void even if it is in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rules or orders made thereunder Each of these provisions confers the power to make rules for regulating It is pertinent to bear in mind that the power to regulate conferred by sections and is not only with respect to the grant of licences and leases mentioned in those sub sections but is also with respect to purposes connected therewith that is purposes connected with such grant they also knew that under the corresponding Entry in the Federal Legislative List the Act had been enacted and was on the statute book and that the Act conferred wide rule making power upon <ORG> to regulate the grant of mining leases and for the conservation and development of minerals When the Act came to be enacted <ORG> knew that different State Governments had in pursuance of the provisions of Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules made rules for regulating the grant of leases in respect of minor minerals and other matters connected therewith and for this reason it expressly provided in sub section of section of the Act that the rules in force immediately before the commencement of that Act would continue in force until superseded by rules made under sub section of section In fact even so far as minerals other than minor minerals were concerned what <ORG> did as pointed out earlier was to transfer to the Act certain provisions which had until then been dealt with under the rule making power of <ORG> in order to restrict the scope of subordinate legislation There is no substance in the contention that no guidelines are provided in the Act for the exercise of the rule making power of the State Governments under section Section however contains sub section which sets out the particular matters with respect to which <ORG> may make rules In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power that is the rule making power conferred by sub section It is well settled that where a statute confers particular powers without prejudice to the generality of a general power already conferred the particular powers are only illustrative of the general power and do not in any way restrict the general power Section of the Defence of India Act as amended by section of the Defence of India Amendment Act conferred upon <ORG> the power to make such rules as appeared to it to be necessary or expedient for securing the defence of British Indias the public safety the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community Sub section of section conferred upon <ORG> the power to provide by rules or to empower any authority to make orders providing for various matters set out in the said sub section This power was expressed by the opening words of the said sub section to be without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section is merely an illustrative one the rule making power is conferred by sub and the rules which are referred to in the opening sentence of sub are the rules which are authorized by and made under sub the provisions of sub are not restrictive of sub as indeed is expressly stated by the words without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub What sub section of section does is to give illustrations of the matters in respect of which <ORG> can make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith The opening clause of sub section of section namely In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power makes it clear that the topics set out in that sub section are already included in the general power conferred by sub section but are being listed to particularize them and to focus attention on them particular matters in respect of which <ORG> can make rules under sub section of section are therefore also matters with respect to which under sub section of section <ORG> can make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith When section directs that The provisions of sections to inclusive shall not apply to quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals what is intended is that the matters contained in those sections so far as they concern minor minerals will not be controlled by <ORG> but by the concerned <ORG> by exercising its rule making power as a delegate of <ORG> Sections to form a group of sections under the heading General restrictions on undertaking prospecting and mining operations The exclusion of the application of these sections to minor minerals means that these restrictions will not apply to minor minerals but that it is left to <ORG> to prescribe such restrictions as they think fit by rules made under section In providing that section will not apply to quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals what was done was to take away from <ORG> the power to make rules in respect of minor minerals and to confer that power by section upon <ORG> The ambit of the power under section and under section is however the same the only difference being that in one case it is <ORG> which exercises the power in respect of minerals other than minor minerals while in the other case it is <ORG> which do so in respect of minor minerals Sub section of section which is illustrative of the general power conferred by section contains sufficient guidelines for <ORG> to follow in framing the rules under section and in the same way <ORG> have before them the restrictions and other matters provided for in sections to while framing their own rules under section The next question to be considered is whether the rule making power of the State Governments under section includes a power to charge dead rent and royalty Royalty is defined in <ORG> Law Lexicon Fourteenth Edition at page as Royalty payment to a patentee by agreement on every article made according to his patent or to an author by a publisher on every copy of his book sold or to the owner of minerals for the right of working the same on every ton or other weight raised In <ORG> Laws of England Fourth Edition in the volume which deals with Mines Minerals and Quarries namely volume it is stated in paragraph as follows Section of the Transfer of Property Act contains the definitions of the terms lease lessor lessee premium and rent and is as follows Lease defined A lease of immoveable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property made for a certain time express or implied or in perpetuity in consideration of a price paid or promised or of money a share of crops service or any other thing of value to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee who accepts the transfer on such terms Since the mining lease confers upon the lessee the right not merely to enjoy the property as under an ordinary lease but also to extract minerals from the land and to appropriate them for his own use or benefit in addition to the usual rent for the area demised the lessee is required to pay a certain amount in respect of the minerals extracted proportionate to the quantity so extracted In order to ensure for the lessor a regular income whether the mine is worked or not a fixed amount is provided to be paid to him by the lessee The power to make rules for regulating the grant of such leases would therefore include the power to fix the consideration payable by the lessee to the lessor in the shape of ordinary rent or Surface rent dead rent and royalty If this were not so it would lead to the absurd result that when the <ORG> grants a mining lease it is granted gratis to a person who wants to extract minerals and profit from them Rules for regulating the grant of mining leases cannot be confined merely to rules providing for the form in which applications for such leases are to be made the factors to be taken into account in granting or refusing such applications and other cognate matters Such rules must necessarily include provisions with respect to the consideration for the grant Under section therefore the State <ORG>s have the power to make rules providing for payment of surface rent dead rent and royalty by the lessee to the <ORG> The <ORG> and the rule making authorities have also throughout understood the power to make rules in respect of mining leases and minerals as including the power to charge dead rent and royalty Section of the Act conferred powers upon <ORG> to make rules for regulating the grant of mining leases Section of that Act conferred upon <ORG> the power to make rules for the conservation and development of minerals Both section and contained a sub section which set out the different matters in respect of which <ORG> could make rules and both these sub sections opened with the clause In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power As seen earlier the particular matters so set out were illustrative of the general power conferred by the earlier sub sections Under clause i of section the rules to be made by <ORG> could provide for the levy and collection of royalties fees or taxes in respect of minerals mined quarried excavated or collected Rule of the Mineral concession Rules made by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Act prescribed the conditions which were to be included in every mining lessee The said Rule provided for payment of royalty on minerals at the rate specified in the First Schedule to the said Rules in force on the date of the grant of the lease as also to pay royalty at such revised rates as may be notified from time to time It also provided for payment of surface rent and further provided for payment of dead rent with a proviso that the lessee was liable to pay dead rent or royalty whichever was higher in amount but not both Rules made by the State Governments in respect of minor minerals also provided for payment of these charges Similarly Rule of the Bombay Minor Mineral Extraction Rules provided for the lessee of a quarry lease to pay royalty at the rates specified in Schedule I to the said Rules such rates being liable to be revised once in every five years as also surface rent and yearly dead rent and also provided that the lessee shall be liable to pay the dead rent or royalty in respect of each minor mineral whichever be higher in amount but not both Section of the Act conferred upon <ORG> the power to make rules for the purpose of modifying or altering the terms and conditions of any mining lease granted prior to the commencement of the Act so as to bring it into conformity with the rules made under sections and So far as the Act is concerned under clause i of section the rules to be made by <ORG> can provide for the fixing and the collection of dead rent fines fees or other charges and the collection of royalties The reason was that a separate provision in that behalf was made by section with respect to mining leases granted both before the commencement of the Act as also after the commencement of the Act Sonbal Case held that the intention of <ORG> in enacting section was not to clothe the State Governments with power to impose any financial liability upon the lessee but only to give them the power to prescribe conditions for regulating the grant of leases other than conditions relating to financial liability and that the power to prescribe conditions relating to financial liability of a lessee were to be found only in sub section of section Though sub section was inserted in section with retrospective effect by the Amendment Act of until it was so inserted it was not before the courts when they came to construe the scope of the rule making power of the State Governments under section and even without sub section being before the courts various <ORG> have held that the State Governments power to charge royalty is to be found in the rule making power conferred by section A proper reading of sub section of section shows that it does not confer any power upon <ORG>s to make rules with respect to royalty Royalty is payable by the holder of a quarry lease or mining lease or other mineral concession granted under rules made under sub section of section If the reliance placed by the Gujarat and <ORG> on sub section of section in order to ascertain the intention of <ORG> was misplaced their reliance upon section A was even more misplaced It cast a liability upon the holder of a mining lease whether granted before or after the commencement of the Act that is either before or after September to pay to <ORG> dead rent at the rates specified for the time being in the Third Schedule to the Act notwithstanding anything contained in the instrument of lease or in any other law for the time being in force The next contention was that though under section <ORG>s may have the power to make rules providing for payment of royalty and dead rent sub section showed that such power did not extend to amending the rules so as to enhance the rate of dead rent The submission in this behalf was that the power to enhance the rate of royalty by amending the rules was expressly provided for in sub section by the use of the words at the rate prescribed for the time being in the rules framed by <ORG> in respect of minor minerals but there was no such provision in section with respect to dead rent Rules under section though made by <ORG>s are rules made under a Central Act and the provisions of the General Clauses Act apply to such rules Under section of the General Clauses Act where by any Central Act a power to make rules is conferred then that power includes a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions if any to add to amend vary or rescind any rules so made The power to amend the rules is therefore comprehended within the power to make rules and as section confers upon <ORG>s the power to make rules providing for payment of dead rent and royalty it also confers upon <ORG>s the power to amend those rules so as to alter the rates of royalty and dead rent so prescribed either by enhancing or reducing such rates It was then contended that the very language of sub section of section shows that it does not confer any power upon the State Governments to enhance the rate of royalty or dead rent because the rules which are to be made under that sub section are for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases and other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and therefore the rules under that sub section can be made only with respect to the time when such leases or concessions are granted and not with respect to any point of time subsequent thereto and there being no provision similar to sub section of section with respect to dead rent any rule providing for increase in the rate of dead rent during the subsistence of a lease would be ultra vires section As pointed out earlier sub section of section does not confer any power to amend the rules made under section for the power to amend the rules is comprehended within the power to make the rules conferred by sub section of section Ordinary leases of immovable property at times provide for periodic increases of rent and there is no reason why such increases should not be made in a mining or quarry lease or other mineral concession granted under a regulatory statute intended for the benefit of the public and even less reason why such a statute should not confer power to make rules providing for increases in the rate of dead rent during the subsistence of the lease In any event the power to make rules under section is also for purposes connected with the grant of mining and quarry leases and other mineral concessions and the expression and for purposes connected therewith read with the word grant would include the power to enhance the rate of dead rent during the subsistence of the lease In support of the above contention it was also submitted that in the absence of a provision like the one contained in section the power to enhance the rate of dead rent cannot be so exercised as to affect subsisting leases and that unless this construction were placed upon sub section the power conferred by that sub section would be bad in law as being an arbitrary power It was submitted that a mining lease is the result of a contract entered into between two parties and dead rent is part of the consideration for the grant of the lease and just as in the case of a contract of sale of goods it cannot be left to the sweet will of the seller to charge what price he liked in the same way in the case of leases and concessions granted under section it cannot be left to the State Governments to amend the rules so as to charge whatever dead rent they like and whenever they like during the subsistence of the lease We find no substance in either of these submissions These leases and concessions are granted by the State Governments pursuant to rules made under the statutory power conferred upon them by a regulatory Act In the exercise of the power conferred by Entry <ORG> has made a declaration in section of the Act that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided The presumption is that an authority clothed with a statutory power will exercise such power reasonably and if in the public interest and for the efficacious regulation of mines and quarries of minor minerals and the proper development of such minerals <ORG> as the delegate of the <ORG> Government thinks fit to amend the rules so as to enhance the rate of dead rent it cannot be said that it is prevented from doing so by the principles of the ordinary law of contracts Where a statute confers discretionary powers upon the executive or an administrative authority the validity or constitutionality of such power cannot be judged on the assumption that the executive or such authority will act in an arbitrary manner in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it If the executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute conferring the power or the power which has been conferred by it There is no such provision with respect to a rule or notification amending a rule made by a State Government It was therefore submitted that in the absence of any provision for legislative approval with respect to the rules made by the State Governments or a notification amending such rules it is all the more necessary that an opportunity should be given to the concerned lessees to raise their objections to any proposed enhancement The argument that the lessees who would be affected by an enhancement in the rate of royalty or dead rent should be heard before making such enhancement is based upon a total misunderstanding of the rule making process and the power to make rules The enhancement in the rates of royalty and dead rent is made in the exercise of the power to amend the rules framed under section It is thus made in the exercise of statutory power There is no such principle of law that before such a statutory power is exercised persons who may be affected thereby should be heard Whether any opportunity is to be given to persons affected to make representations to the Government would depend upon the form in which the rule making power is conferred It is for the legislative body which confers the rule making power to decide in what form such power should be conferred In some Acts it is provided that the draft of the rules proposed to be made as also any proposed amendment thereto should be published in the Official Gazette so that members of the public may have an opportunity of making such representations or raising such objections as they think fit It was therefore for <ORG> to decide whether rules and notifications made by the State Governments under section should be laid before <ORG> or the <ORG> of the State or not An amendment of the rules made under section even though it may have the effect of enhancing the rates of royalty or dead rent does not therefore become bad in law because no opportunity of being heard or making a representation is given to persons who would be prejudicially affected thereby Another submission which was made was that sub section of section speaks of a mining lease or any other mineral concession while sub section of section speaks of quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions and therefore the power to fix from time to time the rate of royalty under sub section can only apply to mining leases and other minor mineral concessions and not to quarry leases It was further submitted that though under the proviso to section the rate of royalty in respect of a minor mineral cannot be enhanced more than once during any period of four years there was no such restriction with respect to enhancing the rate of dead rent and <ORG>s cannot nullify the prohibition contained in the proviso to section by repeatedly and frequently enhancing the rate of dead rent and that the absence of such a restrictive provision with respect to dead rent shows that it was not the intention of <ORG> to confer power upon <ORG> to enhance the rate of dead rent so as to affect subsisting leases In all <ORG> rules which provide for payment of both dead rent and royalty there is a provision that only dead rent or royalty whichever is higher in amount is to be paid but not both Rules made under the Act as for example Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules and Rule of the Bombay Mineral Extraction Rules also contained a similar provision Thus the practice followed throughout in exercising the power to make rules regulating the grant of mining leases has been to provide that either dead rent or royalty whichever is higher in amount should be paid by the lessee but not both Although in one sense dead rent may partake of the nature of royalty there is a substantial difference between both The bases for calculating royalty and dead rent are different and they are dealt with in different provisions of the Act namely sections and A so far as minerals other than minor minerals are concerned and in the rules made by the State Governments under section so far as minor minerals are concerned It is pertinent to note that the words used in the proviso are shall not enhance the rate of royalty The period of four years for this purpose must be and can only be reckoned from the date of coming into force of the rules and it is open to a State Government to enhance the rate of royalty or dead rent at any time once during the period of four years from the coming into force of the rules and after each period of four years expires at any time during each succeeding period of four years By Notification dated July the word Director that is the Director of Geology Mining Gujarat State was substituted by the words competent officer Clause of Part VI of the said Schedule confers upon <ORG> the power to enter upon the leased premises and distrain all or any of the mineral or beneficiated processed dressed products or movable property there and to sell the same or so much as is necessary to recover the rent or royalties due and all costs and expenses in case the royalty or rent or both reserved and made payable by the lessee is not paid within sixty days after the date fixed in the lease for the payment thereof By the Notification <ORG> made the Gujarat Minor Mineral Fourth Amendment Rules which came into force with effect from December By the Notification <ORG> made the Gujarat Minor Mineral Second Amendment Rules which came into force on November Though section of the General Clauses Act does not in express terms refer to rules made under an Act the same principle of construction would in our opinion apply in the case of rules made under an Act Rule was not substituted for the purpose of conferring upon the State Government the power to enhance the rates of royalty specified in Schedule I It was substituted for a wholly different purpose namely to bring the said Rule in conformity with sub section which was inserted with retrospective effect in section by the Amendment Act of In fact sub clause a of clause i of Rule and clause of Part of the Schedule to Form namely the Form of Quarrying Lease appended to the Gujarat Rules expressly provided a condition that the lessee is to pay to the Government royalty at the rates for the time being specified in and in force under Schedule I to the Gujarat Rules The enhancement in the rates of royalty by the Notification was in the third period of four years reckoned from the date of coming into force of the Gujarat Rules namely from April The Notification however once again enhanced during the same period the rates of royalty in respect of several minor minerals and to the extent that the Notification enhanced the rates of royalty in respect of those minor minerals it was invalid as violating the proviso to section The judgment under appeal of <ORG> to the extent that it holds to the contrary is therefore erroneous and requires to be reversed and set aside By the Notification the Government of Gujarat made the Gujarat Minor Mineral Second Amendment Rules which came into force with effect from April By the Notification <ORG> made the Gujarat Minor Minerals Amendment Rules which came into force with effect from April We have already discussed the correctness of that judgment and have held that under the rule making power conferred upon them by section <ORG> can make rules charging dead rent as also can amend the rules to enhance the rates of dead rent so as to effect even subsisting leases and have pointed out that the judgment of <ORG> in Smt The reasons given by <ORG> for coming to the conclusion that the Notification violated Article were very much the same as prompted it to hold that <ORG> could not enhance the rates of dead rent during the subsistence of a lease We do not find that the enhancement in the rates of dead rent made by the Notification amount to any unreasonable restrictions on the right of the holders of quarry leases to carry on their trade or business The rates of dead rent specified in the Notification cannot be looked at in isolation but must be read in conjunction with the drastic reduction made in the rates of royalty and so read there is nothing unreasonable in them In the said Circular it was stated that as the Notification had been declared ultra vires by <ORG> the Government was advised that royalty could be charged from April at the rates which were in force on the eve of the publication of the Notification By the said Circular instructions were issued to all Collectors District Development Officers and the Director <ORG> Ahmedabad to collect royalty on minor minerals quarried from April on this basis and in making such recovery to adjust the amounts paid by the holder of the lease by way of dead rent The validity of the said Circular and the directions given thereunder have been challenged on the ground that <ORG> had merely held that <ORG> had no power to charge dead rent or to enhance its rates under section of the Act and therefore it was not justified in striking down the entire Notification including that part of it which related to royalty but should have struck down only that part which dealt with dead rent If the contention in this behalf were correct it would lead to the startling result that on and from the date of the coming into force of the Notification no royalty was payable in respect of minor minerals and that on and from the date of the coming into force of the Notification no dead rent was payable in respect of any leased area Though <ORG> cannot be blamed for issuing the said Circular for it had to deal with the problem posed by the judgment of <ORG> in Smt<NAME><NAME> case the said Circular was none the less not valid in law because the Notification as also Rule were valid and operative and the State Government could not by a circular letter charge and collect royalty at rates different from the rate specified in the Notification<NAME> The directions contained in the said Circular were therefore invalid<NAME> As a further consequence of the judgment of <ORG> in Smt It was contended that the rates of royalty specified in the Notification were so excessive and arbitrary as to be totally unreasonable and therefore the Notification violated Article of the Constitution because it placed unreasonable restrictions on the Fundamental Right of the holders of quarry leases to carry on their trade and business We find no substance in this contention If the rates of royalty so enhanced are looked at alone it would appear that they are unreasonable but when we take into account the fact that dead rent is not payable after the coming into force of the Notification the position is completely altered and it cannot be said that enhancement in the rates of royalty is unreasonable If we compare the rates of royalty specified in the Notification with those specified in the Notification and we bear in mind that under the Notification dead rent was also payable under the Notification we find that in some cases the rates of royalty are reduced for example the rate of royalty in respect of dressed and carved marble and slabs of marble was Rs per metric tonne in the Notification while under the Notification blocks and slabs of marble above cms There are sufficient guidelines provided in the Act for the exercise of the rule making power of the State Governments under section of the Act These guidelines are to be found in the object for which such power is conferred namely for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith the meaning of the word regulating the scope of the phrase for purposes connected therewith the illustrative matters set out in sub section of section and the restrictions and other matters contained in sections to of the Act <NAME> The power to make rules conferred by section includes the power to make rules charging dead rent and royalty The power to make rules under section includes the power to amend the rules so made including the power to amend the rules so as to enhance the rates of royalty and dead rent A State Government is entitled to amend the rules under section enhancing the rates of royalty and dead rent even as regards leases subsisting at the date of such amendment Sub section of section does not confer upon the State Governments the power to make rules charging royalty or to enhance the rate of royalty so charged from time to time The sole repository of the power of the State Governments to make rules and amendments thereto including amendments enhancing the rates of royalty and dead rent is sub section of section A State Government is not required to give an opportunity of a hearing or of making a representation to the lessees who would be affected by any amendments of the rules before making such amendments The period of four years for the purpose of enhancing the rates of dead rent and royalty is to be reckoned from the date of coming into force of the rules made by the particular State Government In the light of the above conclusions reached by us we will now deal with each individual matter These appeals are accordingly partly allowed and the judgment appealed against is reversed to the extent that it holds that the enhancement in the rates of royalty made by the Notification dated November was invalid and inoperative and the enhancement in the rates of royalty made by the Notification dated October was valid and operative The said judgment is confirmed in so far as it holds that <ORG> has the power to classify building stones into different varieties and levy a different rate of royalty in respect of each such variety The orders dismissing the writ petitions under Article of the Constitution of India filed by the Appellants in these Appeals in <ORG> are set aside and the said writ petitions are allowed in part and it is declared that the enhancement in the rates of royalty made by the Notification dated November was valid and became operative with effect from December and that the enhancement in the rates of royalty made by the Notification dated October was invalid We also restrain the State of Gujarat and its officers from recovering any amount by way of royalty and at the enhanced rates specified in the Notification dated October or from retaining any such amount if recovered in excess of the amount which would by payable in accordance with the Notification dated November and we further direct the State of Gujarat to refund to the Appellants in these Appeals any such excess amount subject to the directions given hereinafter with respect to payment and refund Civil Appeals Nos the writ petitions filed by the Appellants in these Appeals challenging the validity of the directions contained in the Circular No CHH dated February and for an order restraining the State of Gujarat and its officers from acting upon the said Circular and the Notification dated October and directing the State of Gujarat to implement the Notification dated March Civil Appeal Nos and of are directed against the order of <ORG> dismissing the writ petitions filed by the Appellants challenging the constitutionality of section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act and the validity of Notification No GU MCR CHH dated June and directing the Appellants to approach the Supreme court as similar matters were pending there If <ORG> thought that the point raised by the Appellants was the same as was pending in this Court it ought to have stayed the hearing of the writ petitions until this Court disposed of the other matters If as a result of this Judgment and the interim orders passed by this Court any amount becomes payable by any lessee of any mining lease of quarry lease to the State of Gujarat the same will be paid by him to the State of Gujarat after giving such lessee credit for the amount already paid in respect of the same period as also any excess amount paid in respect of any other period
