Mr <NAME> objection shortly stated is that contrary to the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Public Prosecutor abdicated his duty to conduct the prosecution and that a pleader privately briefed and instructed took complete charge of the case and effectively determined its course and that as a consequence there was grave prejudice to the appellants Before we take up the question of prejudice we shall consider what the requirements of the Code are in regard to this matter The last section in our opinion while it does not interfere with the generally recognised right of a counsel to depute another professional gentleman with instructions to plead and act in a case of which he is in charge provides for the special case where a pleader is appointed by a private party It seems to us that having regard to the object and purpose underlying the section and understood with reference to the word acting used in the definition of Public Prosecutor the learned Judge interpretation is right So when Section authorizes a privately engaged pleader to act in the case under the directions of the Public Prosecutor he may do everything in the case provided that it is done under the control and direction of the Public Prosecutor In that case it was urged on behalf of the accused that the counsel for the complainant had at the trial interrupted the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses by the accused frequently and unfairly so as to nullify the very object of cross examination and that the procedure adopted by <ORG> had resulted in irreparable prejudice to the accused <NAME> who wrote the leading judgment observed that the procedure followed by the learned Sessions Judge in allowing the prosecution to be conducted by a counsel engaged and briefed by the complainant in the case and not by the Public Prosecutor is in violation of the express and mandatory provisions of the Code contained in Section which leads us to the inevitable conclusion that any person engaged and briefed by a private person in the case to instruct the Public Prosecutor can only so instruct and act under the directions of the Public Prosecutor and in such a case the prosecution shall be conducted by the Public Pro secutor himself There is therefore no substance in the contention that Section ft enables the Public Prosecutor to abdicate his functions and allow a person briefed by a private party interested in the result of the case to take over charge of the case and conduct the prosecution Both the learned Judges were of opinion that apart from the above objection which they thus dealt with there was also in the case before them another ground for directing a re trial The fact that <NAME> was dealing with a case before a Magistrate does not for the present purposes make any difference because he was interpreting Section and that section governs cases before Magis trates as well as before <ORG> These provisions are clearly conceived in the public interest as well as in the interest of the accused because the position of the Public Prosecutor is it must be borne in mind unlike that of any advocate appearing for a private party It is true that in every case there is the over all control of the court in regard to the conduct of the case by either party It was the same pleader again who raised objections successfully to certain questions sought to be put by counsel for the accused during the cross examination of the th witness for the prosecution After a careful consideration of the various facts put before us we have reached the conclusion that Mr <NAME> not only did the case for the Public Prosecutor but be determined alone and without any restraint the course which the prosecution pursued every time a choice was presented between two alternative courses It is no wonder therefore that no accommodation was made to the point of view urged on behalf of the accused The trial involved a large number of accused and according to the prosecution there was quite a good number of persons available who could give evidence as to the occurrence The convictions and sentences are therefore set aside and the appellants will be re tried on charges properly framed
