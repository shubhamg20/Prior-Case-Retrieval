The two respondents contested the petition and the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the accident was not due to any negligence or rashness on the part of the dirver of the lorry that it was an inevitable accident due to an unforeseen mechanical defect and that therefore the claimants are not entitled to any compensation The <ORG> also gave a finding that if the claimants are entitled to compensation on the ground that the accident was a result of rash or negligent driving of the vehicle a sum of Rs The first question that arises for consideration is whether the accident was as a result of negligence We have also the evidence of <NAME> the police officer who visited the scene sometime after the accident and he has drawn a plan as per Exhibit showing the tyre marks and other particulars There are two aspects of the question There is no evidence as to whether the sub axle nuts broke or slipped <NAME> in Motor Claims Cases th Edition page points out that if an accident is due to a latent defect which is not discoverable by reasonable care there is no negligence In the present case there is absolutely no evidence to show that the st respondent took any care to avoid the mechanical defect The next point to be considered is whether the appellants who are the brothers and sister of <NAME> since deceased are persons entitled to claim compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act Per contra the contention on behalf of the appellants is that the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act have no application to claim before <ORG> that the provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act give a right to all legal representatives of the deceased to maintain to claim for compensatior that the term legal representatives occurring in section A of the Act would take in the brothers and sister of a deceased who died a bachelor and that therefore their claim cannot be negatived on the ground that they are not dependants as defired under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act Even in respect of claims before <ORG> one has necessarily to look to the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act because the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act do not create substantive rights but they any only procedural in character law under which persons can claim compensation for either death or injury caused by tortious acts Undoubtedly the substantive right to claim compensation is only under the general law of torts It cannot be disputed and as a matter of fact it is not disputed that either an injured or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be should establish that the accident was as a result of rashness or negligence on the part of the owner of the motor vehicle or his servant before ever they can claim compensation in espect of the accident That being so merely because Section A says that either the injured person or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be can file application for compensation and Section says that <ORG> may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to be just it cannot be claimed that any new right is created under these provisions The <ORG> making an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just has naturally to look to the law of torts in determining such compensation If the owner of the vehicle is not a tort feaser then in spite of the accident causing either injury or death as the case may be no compensation can be awarded by the <ORG> Section as it originally stood stated that the insurance must be a policy which insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in Sub section against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place There is also a proviso to this Clause but that need not be referred to now In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in Sub section i against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place ii against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place As in the new Clause i it is stated that the insurance is to he against any liability which may be incurred by the person or classes of persons specified in the policy but Clause ii simply says that the insurance is to be against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle without referring to any liability which may be incurred by the person or classes of persons insured in respect of such death of or bodily injury to any passenger it is said that under the abovesaid clause viz In paragraph of the said objects and reasons it is stated that the bill seeks to provide for covering of passenger risks for public service vehicles irrespective of the culpability of the owner or driver of such vehicle for any accident in which it may be involved provided that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the victim If really the present Section creates an absolute liability in respect of passengers in a public service vehicle that fact would only highlight the position that in respect of other claimants there is no question of absolute liability and that the claimants can succeed only by proving that the injury or the death as the case may be was due to tortious act on the part of the owner of the motor vehicle either directly or vicariously Under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act a new right is created in favour of certain defendants who are named therein to maintain an action or suit for damages in respect of the death of a person If the person wronged does not die as a result of the wrong doing under the general law of torts he always has the right to maintain an action for loss of estate I will come to the question what exactly is the loss of estate a little later It may he seen that this provision contained in Section of the Fatal Accidents Act itself is procedural in character as it does not create any substantive right in the executor administrator or representative of the deceased to claim pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased Thus it is dear that Section of the Fatal Accidents Act itself does not create any right but it is only an enabling provision saying that if there is an action or suit for loss of benefit to the dependants the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for pecuriary loss to the estate of the deceased in the same action There is no distinction between a motor accident causing fatal injuries to a person and other accidents or any other act causing such fatal injuries regarding rights and liabilities of the parties Under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act as it stood before the amendment of the year the State Governments had been empowered to appoint persons to investigate and report on motor accidents The present provisions contained in Sections to came into effect on February It is stated that the original provision had not helped persons of limited means in preferring claims on account of injury or death because a <ORG> decree has to be obtained before the obligation of an insurance company to meet the claims can be enforced and it is therefore proposed to empower State Governments to appoint <ORG> to determine and award damages There can be no doubt therefore that the provisions cortained in Sections to of the Motor Vehicles Act which speak of the constitution of <ORG> and how applications to such Tribunals should be made and disposed of relate only to procedure and they have nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties Till the recent amendment of the Act by Act LVI of section stated that <ORG> is to be constituted for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles Section no of the Act as it stood before the recent amendment of did not specifically provide for <ORG> going into the question such damages to property He filed a suit in the civil Court for damages towards his personal injuries as well as damages to the cycle As <ORG> had been constituted the civil Court returned the plaint holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain any part of the claim On a revision against such an order <NAME> as he then was held that in so far as the claim in respect of personal injuries is concerned Sections and of the Motor Vehicles Act make it clear that the claim for bodily injury is triable only by <ORG> having territorial jurisdiction but the jurisdiction of such <ORG> is limited by the terms of the statute and did not cover claims of damages to property and that therefore the civil Court had jurisdiction to try the suit in so far as that relates to the claim of compensation for demage to the property Section no before the recent amendment read as follows A State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals hereinafter referred to as Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles The words motor vehicles occurring in the above sub section have now been substituted with other words and a proviso has also been added and Section as amended reads as follows A State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals hereinafter referred to as Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles or damage to any property of a third party so arising or both Provided that where such claim includes a claim for compensation in respect of damage to property exceeding rupees two thousand the claimant may at his option refer the claim to a civil <ORG> for adjudication and where a reference is so made <ORG> shall have no jurisdiction to enertain any question relating to such claim the civil <ORG> and <ORG> would have concurrent jurisdiction as it were and the claimant in such a case would have the option to choose the forum Before dealing with the case law on the point I would like to dispose of another aspect But Section does not really give power to <ORG> to make any rules It is Section A that gives power to <ORG> to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Sections to I take it that the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals Rules are made under the above provision viz The definition says that the terms include even persons who intermeddle with the estate of the deceased Even so this definition would not take in all the persons who would be entitled to file claim as per the provisions contained in the Fatal Accidents Act and the Legal Representatives Suits Act the claim for loss of benefit as well as that for loss of the estate can be brought not only by an executor or administrator but also by a representative of the deceased As already pointed out if there is a claim for loss of benefit to the dependants mentioned in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act a claim for loss to the estate the cause of action for which claim is preserved by the Legal Representatives Suits Act can be inserted in the same claim Sections to of the Act being only procedural in character and having nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties do not make any reference to either loss of benefit or loss to the estate as heads on which compensation can be claimed in the case of a person whose death was caused by a motor accident The term legal representative therefore should necessarily include not only persons who represent the estate of the deceased who can claim loss to the estate of the deceased and the next of kin who are mentioned as dependants under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act who can claim compensation for loss of benefit to themselves whether they represent the estate of the deceased or not <ORG> points out that as per Section of the present Code of Civil Procedure a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person must include different legatees under the will and that there is no justification for holding that the estate in the context must mean the whole of the estate First of all Section A of the Act gives power to <ORG> to make rules only for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Sections to This contention if I may say so with respect was rightly rejected by the Bench of <ORG> One of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants is that as Section of the Act speaks of the <ORG> making an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just the powers of the <ORG> are independent of the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act as well as that under the Legal Representatives Suits Act and that therefore the provisions of the Act must be construed as substantive provisions and not merely procedural in character loss of earning other pecuniary loss arising out of the injury and shortening of expectation of life if any provided the injury or injuries had been caused by a tortious act by the owner of the vehicle by himself or vicariously So even though the Claims <ORG> is given power to determine the amount of compensation which appears to be just it has necessarily to look to the law of torts in determining such just compensation In the recent amendment i under amending Act LVI of some new sections have been added one of which section CC gives power to <ORG> to award simple interest on the amount awarded from the date of the claim application It cannot be said that that creates any new right and thereby the provisions in the Act become substantive law and not merely procedural in character for even the civil <ORG> is not incompetent to award such interest The conclusion was that even in respect of accidents which occurred prior to the constitution of the <ORG> only the <ORG> will have exclusive jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> is ousted With respect I agree with the view expressed by the above Bench <ORG> has taken the same view a similar view has been taken and it has been held that Sections to merely deal with the subject of the substitution of <ORG> in place of civil Courts for the purpose of adjudicating on claims for compensation and they do not deal with the question of substantive rights and liabilities of parties Court has also taken a similar view in two cases viz <ORG> has also taken a similar view The sister of a deceased person is no doubt not a dependant as contemplated under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act but still if she represented the estate of the deceased she could certainly maintain an action for claim on the ground of loss to the estate of the deceased Therefore there is nothing wrong in awarding compensation to her towards the death of her brother This conclusion does not go counter to the view expressed by us and in <NAME> <ORG> A <NAME> that an argument addressed at motion hearing is rarely full and that a decision given at such a hearing must be held to be one given by the learned Judge per incuriam and that such a decision by a Court per incuriam is not binding as a precedent In these decisions the view expressed by <NAME> and <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> A and the other cases which take a similar view have not been considered a Division Bench of this Court referred to the decision of <NAME> The only other decision which has to be referred to in this connection is <NAME> <NAME> A In allowing the appeal the learned Judge has observed that the Motor Vehicles Act is a special enactment and that it excludes the general enactment viz If the claim is towards loss of benefit it should necessarily be under the Fatal Accidents Act and without invoking the provisions therein there is no scope for awarding compensation for loss of benefit However I may mention that it is settled law that while fixing the quantum of compensation towards loss of benefit any pecuniary advantage received by the claimants upon the death of the deceased should also be taken into consideration and compensation awarded towards loss to the estate of the deceased would also be such pecuniary advantage which should be taken into consideration in assessing the quantum towards loss of benefit If a person who is injured lives for sometime but later succumbs to the injuries sustained in the accident a person who represents the estate of the deceased can claim damages for the pain and suffering of the deceased as well as loss of earnings and other damages actually suffered by the victim between the date of the accident and the date of death Therefore there was no pain and suffering to the deceased or any loss of earning from the time of accident till the time of death There is also nothing to show that the deceased suffered any other damages due to the accident There was a compendious award of towards pain and suffering physical disabilities and loss of expectation of life is referred to by <ORG> and they held that the principle laid down in that case viz It is pointed out that damages given for shortening of life loss of expectation of life should not be calculated solely or even mainly on the basis of the length of life that is lost but they should be fixed at a reasonable figure for the loss of a measure of prospective happiness If there are materials to show that the victim would not have led a happy life if he had not been killed in the accident the assessment of compensation for loss of expectation of life has to be lower than in normal cases <ORG> held in one case that the estate could recover for the loss of future happiness of the victim but Viscount <NAME> was soon to persuade his fellow Law Lords that this claim should be strictly contained the result is that no more than or so is recoverable by the estate for this The estate cannot claim for loss of earnings in the period during which the victim would otherwise have lived there is no claim for future loss of amenities or limbs and the like I would quote the relevant passage In assessing damages under this head regard must be had to the injured party normal expectation of life and not to his expectation of life in his injured condition or to the fact that his injuries are such that he does not want his life to be prolonged or does not know it has been shortened There was no prospect of his earning anything more in the years to come and there was no question of his saving anything out of it Considering these facts <NAME> held that the deceased could have expect to be looked after well and maintained comfortably by his sons and that therefore by his death there was loss of prospective happiness to the deceased that the assessment of the same at Rs Their Lordships of <ORG> stress the fact that the right of action in respect of compensation for loss of benefit and that towards loss to the estate are quite distinct and independent and that there was nothing wrong in awarding compensation under both the heads even though the claimants may be the same However there can be no dispute that any sum paid to a dependant of the deceased who is entitled to compensation towards loss of benefit as compensation for loss to the estate would be a pecuniary advantage to him had been awarded under the other head but there is nothing to show that in that case <ORG> in fixing the quantum of compensation towards loss of benefit had not taken into consideration the award under the other head Only under such circumstances it has been held that there was no ground to reduce the sum of Rs Nowhere in the judgment of <ORG> there is any observation that the expected future earnings of the deceased or the savings there form is part of loss of expectation of life or any other item of loss to the estate So on the head of loss to the estate of the deceased the only ground on which compensation can be awarded in this case is loss of expectation of life viz Accordingly the appeal is allowed to the extent that there will be an award in favour of the appellants claimants before the <ORG> below for rupees five thousand which sum is payable by the nd respondent the insurance company within a month from this date I have no hesitation in concurring with the finding of my learned brother that the driver of the lorry was guilty of negligence It has been held by this Court in Palani Ammal The Safe Service Limited A The case law on this subject has been fully discussed by my learned brother and I agree with the preponderance of judicial opinion and the conclusion arrived at by my learned brother that the provisions in Sections A to of the Motor Vehicles Act are only procedural and do not purport to confer any substantial right or liability on the parties I agree with the conclusion of my learned brother that all persons who are entitled to make an application for compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act On our conclusion that all claimants under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act are legal representatives of the deceased and are entitled to compensation as provided for under Section strictly the question as to whether in view of the scope of the definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure Rule of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals Rules is ultra vires or not does not arise in this case In Indian law while in earlier cases a strict meaning was given to the expression legal representative subsequently the term was construed to cover all persons representing the estate of the deceased person Under the old Code a strict meaning was given to the term legal representative as in the English law <NAME> in repelling the contention that the term should be construed strictly and cannot include anybody except the heir executor or administrator of the deceased as the term and the definition were taken from English law and that when the <ORG> used the term legal representative in the section and not the word representative it must have intended to use it in the strict sense observed that the section appears to have been drawn for the protection of the decree holders and to give them a right to relief against the successor in property or estate of the deceased judgment debtor The learned Judge held that the term legal representative appears to have been used as one which would cover ordinary cases of succession The definition has also been extended to the case of a person who without title as administrator executor heir revensioner or surviving coparcener is the de facto possessor of the estate of the deceased Hindu it having been held that he must be treated for some purposes as his representative and that a judgment obtained against such a representative is not a mere nullity After an elaborate review of the authorities the learned Judge summed up the position thus From this review of the authorities it Will appear that judicial decisions have extended the sense of the term legal representative beyond that of its ordinary meaning of administrator executor and heir and though such extension has been attended with doubt and has in some cases been the subject of conflicting decisions it appears to me to be too late now to endeavour however convenient it might be to secure for the term that which is perhaps its strict and legitimate sense I agree therefore in holding that the term is not limited to administrators executors and heirs and am of opinion that it must now be held to include any person who in law represents the estate of a deceased judgment debtor The definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure is too wide and the <ORG> has in fact given effect to the views expressed in <NAME> <NAME> and introduced the present definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads as follows Legal representative means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddless with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued Section provides that not more than one action or suit shall be brought in respect of the same subject matter of complaint and that in any such suit or action the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased Where there is no executor or administrator or where there is one and he fails or is unwilling to sue then in our opinion the suit may be instituted by and in the name of the representative of the person Regarding the term representative of the deceased the Court held that there was no reason for limiting the meaning of the word in a narrow way and found that the word meant and included all or any one of the persons for whose benefit a suit under the Act can be maintained and that these persons are the representatives of the deceased in the sense that they are the persons taking the place of the deceased in obtaining reparation for the wrong done This decision is an authority for the proposition that the word representative of the deceased in Act XIII of would include any person who takes the place of the deceased for obtaining reparation for the wrong done As in this case the question does not arise as the deceased who was a labourer would not have accumulated any earnings for future during his life time the petitioners would not be entitled to any increase in the compensation awarded to them on the ground of likely loss of future earnings or savings therefrom occasioned to the estate of the deceased
