On the th April the plaintiff instituted the present suit for partition of the properties in which he had become a joint owner by purchase and claimed to be planed in separate possession of a one fourth share after partition by metes and bounds The widow of the original owner who was joined as a defendant contended that she was entitled to a share in the event of partition and that the plaintiff was consequently not entitled to more than a one fifth share The Subordinate Judge has given effect to this contention and has made a decree accordingly The substantial point whish has been argued on the present appeal is that the widow is not entitled to a share inasmuch as partition is claimed not by one of her sons but by the purchaser from one of them We are of opinion that there is no foundation for this contention The position of a purchaser from a son is exactly that of a son himself he has the same rights and takes it subject to the name liabilities as those of the person from whom he purchased It was explained that the right the mother has is aright to participate in the property left by her husband a latent and inchoate right of participation which becomes effective when separation takes place in other words she has as <NAME> put it in the case already mentioned a quasi contingent right which may ripen or crystallise if and when the partition takes place Now it has been argued by the appellant that under this text of the Dayabhaga strictly construed the mother is entitled to a share only when her sons make a partition and that consegnently if a partition takes place at tie instance of the purchaser of the share of a son the mother cannot obtain a share The truth is that the author of the Dayabhaga bad before him the problem of the partition of the family estate at the instance of a member thereof be did not deal with the Question of partition enforced by a stranger who by his purchase becomes a joint owner of the family property but not a member of the joint family itself a partition at his instance cannot by any stretch of language be Ballad Dayabhaga or partition of heritage and must consequently be regarded as foreign to the proper scope of the treatise of <NAME> When partition of the family properties is claimed in such circumstances by a stranger to the family the question which arise must accordingly be determined by reference to general principles not inconsistent with those formulated for the case of partition enforced by a so parcener in the joint family One of such general principles as we have already explained is that a member of the family cannot by alienation of his interest prejudice the position of another member because no owner of property is competent as a general rule to convey to any person a higher right than what he himself possesses The substance of the matter thus is that although the text of the Dayabhaga Chapter III Section paragraph speaks only of a partition made by sons and the allotment thereupon of a share to the mother there is nothing said in the passage or in any other authoritative text of Hindu Law which we have been able to discover as to the mother right to a share on partition being so absolutely nonexistent before partition that it may be defeated by any of her sons alienating his share before a partition Apart from this it is plain that the literal and restrictive construction of the passage of the Dayabhaga as interpreted by the appellant would lead to the obviously unreasonable conclusion that if the suit were instituted by one of the tons the mother would be entitled to a share even though one of the defendants happened to be the purchaser of the share of another son while the mother would not be entitled to a share if the suit happened to be instituted by such purchaser himself surely the rights of the mother could not on any rational ground be made dependent upon a purely accidental circumstance namely whether the purchaser of the share of one of her sons is plaintiff or defendant We hold accordingly that though a mother cannot compel a partition so long as the sons remain united if a partition does take place between the Sons she is entitled a share equal to that of a son to the co parcenary property and she is entitled to a similar share on a partition between the sons and the purchaser of the interest of one or more of them A subordinate point which has been argued before us requires consideration Mr Justice <NAME> held in <NAME> both <NAME> Brojonath Dey that on partition of the family property by the sons after their father death their mother is entitled to a share equal to that of a son but if she has before the partition received property from their father either by gift or Will amounting to more than a son share she is entitled to nothing more on partition if on the other hand she has received less she is entitled on partition to as mush as will make what she has received equal to a son share Raference was made to a text of Yajnavalkya where a share is allotted in the case of a partition in the father lifetime to such wives as have had no separate properly given to thorn by their husband or father in law The rule is stated in similar terms in paragraph of the latest edition of the Vyavastha Darpana of Syamacharan Sarkar rd Ed The result is that the decree of the Subordinate Judge is affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs We assess the hearing fee at ten gold mohurs
