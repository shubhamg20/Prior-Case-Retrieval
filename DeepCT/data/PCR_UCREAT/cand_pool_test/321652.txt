Likewise the terminal taxes imposed by the pre Constitution notification were allowed to be levied and collected even after the Constitution came into force by virtue of Art of the Constitution the validity of the newly imposed terminal tax was challenged by the respondent who was carrying on business within the limits of the Municipality in gold silver and precious stones on the ground of legislative incompetence The writ petition was granted by <ORG> and the appellant came to this court after obtaining a certificate of fitness from <ORG> Appeals from the judgment and orders dated October and March of <ORG> in Misc The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR These three appeals which are on certificates of fitness granted by <ORG> the first by <ORG> at Nagpur and the two others by <ORG> raise a common question as regards the construction of Art of the Constitution and the validity of certain terminal taxes imposed by the respective appellant municipal authorities under notifications issued under Ch IX of the Berar Municipalities Act subsequent to the coming into force of the Constitution and so have been heard together Its first sub section specifies in its several clauses varieties of taxes and among them is cl which reads The terminal tax on goods or animals imported into or exported from the limits of the municipality provided that terminal tax under this clause and an octroi under cl shall not be in force in any municipality at the same time The other sub clauses which are relevant for the considera tion of the question arising in the appeal are sub cls Subject to the control of <ORG> a committee may abolish any tax already imposed and specified in sub section clauses a to in inclusive or may within the limits imposed under sub section vary the amount or rate of any such tax Provided that in the case of any municipality indebted to the Government the abolition of any tax or a reduction in the amount or rate thereof shall be subject to the previous sanction of <ORG> Section lays down the procedure for the imposition of taxes and it provides <ORG> on receiving such proposals may sanction or refuse to sanction the same or sanction them subject to such modifications as it may think fit or return them to the committee for further consideration If the proposal is to increase the amount or rate of any tax the committee shall publish in the manner prescribed by rules made under this Act a notice showing in detail the effects of the proposal The committee shall take the proposal and all objections received thereto into consideration at a special meeting and may modify the proposals as it may think fit and may pass a final resolution on the proposal If the proposal requires the previous sanction of <ORG> under the provisions of section sub section or sub section the committee shall forward it to <ORG> and it shall be dealt with in the manner provided in section sub sections and This was superseded by a notification of June under which the Schedules were modified and the terminal tax imposed was confined to goods imported into or exported out of the Municipal area by rail Under the scheme of the distribution of taxing powers between the provinces and the Central Government under the Government of India Act terminal taxes on goods carried by rail were assigned exclusively to <ORG> under item of List I to Sch The taxes imposed by the pre Constitution notification could therefore be legally levied and collected even after the Constitution came into force Subsequent to January there was a notification on December under which to the list of goods liable to terminal tax imported into or exported out of the Municipal area not merely by rail but also by road were added three new items silver and silver jewellery gold and gold jewellery and precious stones and these three specified items were subjected to the tax at the same rates as had been imposed on other articles by the notifications which were in force from before the Constitution The validity of the tax imposed by this notification was challenged by the st respondent who was carrying on business within Amravati municipality in gold silver and precious stones on the ground of legislative incompetency which had not been saved by Article of the Constitution in a petition under Article The learned Judges of <ORG> by a majority accepted the contention raised by the respondent and allowed the petition but granted a certificate of fitness and hence this appeal The facts of the other two appeals are nearly similar but we shall refer to them after dealing with the common question which arises in these appeals Besides it is necessary to add that whereas under the notifications in force prior to st April when Part III of the Government of India Act was brought into force articles imported into or exported out of the municipal area by road were not subject to the tax and that state of affairs continued till long after the Constitution came into force a terminal tax was imposed by the impugned notification of December on goods imported or exported by road a tax which it was not open to the State to impose even with the aid of Art But ignoring this feature of the impugned notification insofar as it brought in goods carried by road within the scope of the terminal tax it is admitted that the validity of the imposition cannot be justified if it was a fresh imposition Any taxes duties cesses or fees which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were being lawfully levied by the Government of any <ORG> or by any municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the <ORG> municipality district or other local area may notwithstanding that those taxes duties cesses or fees are mentioned in the Union List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law If learned Counsel for the appellant is right in his contention that the impugned tax which he is now seeking to sustain was the tax which was being lawfully levied by the municipality before the commencement of the Constitution he would certainly be well founded in the submission that the fact that the terminal taxes are under the distribution of taxing powers under the Constitution assigned to the Union would make no difference for the valid continuance of the levy Secondly he said that the word levy meant not merely the ascertainment i assessment and collection of the tax but included its imposition i also the charging and if that expression were understood in that wide sense it would comprehend a case where other items than those originally specified were brought into the fold of the taxing provision The learned Attorney General who appeared for the <ORG> and supported Mr <NAME> however went a step further and submitted that it was not even necessary that a terminal tax should be actually imposed and was being collected prior to the Constitution but that it was sufficient if the <ORG> enactment had vested in the municipality a power to levy such a tax In other words the reference here is to the entries in the legislative lists which permit such taxes to be levied and so read and taken in conjunction with the circumstance that the Article is one designed to prevent the dislocation of the finances of the <ORG> or other local authorities the terms of the Article would be satisfied and the legislative power to continue to levy the tax would be conferred notwithstanding that the tax etc are mentioned in the Union List as conferring an unlimited legislative power to impose what in effect the argument involves new taxes though of the same type or nature as existed before the Constitution There it was submitted on behalf of the respondent local authority that by virtue of of the Government of India Act <ORG> was vested with a plenary power to legislate in respect of every tax which was being lawfully levied by local authorities prior to the commencement of the Government of India Act This Court rejected that contention and observed Section which is a saving clause and obviously designed to prevent a dislocation of the finances of Local Governments and of local authorities by reason of the coming into force of the provisions of the Government of India Act distributing heads of taxation on lines different from those which prevailed before that date cannot be construed as one conferring a plenary power to legislate on those topics till such time as <ORG> intervened Such a construction would necessarily involve a power in <ORG> to enhance the rates of taxation a result we must say from which Mr <NAME> did not shrink but having regard to the language of the section Supp Of course in the absence of legislation indicating a desire to discontinue the tax the effect of the provision of the Constitution would be to enable the continu ance of the power to levy the tax but this does not alter the fact that the provision by its implication confers a limited legislative power to desire or not to desire the continuance of the levy subject to the overriding power of <ORG> to put an end to its continuance and it is on the basis of the existence of this limited legislative power that the right of <ORG> to repeal the taxation provision under the Act of could be rested Dealing next with the import of the words may continue to be levied the same was summarised in these terms The tax must be one which was lawfully levied by a local authority for the purpose of a local area the identity of the body that collects the tax the area for whose benefit the tax is to be utilised and the purposes for which the utilization is to take place continue to be the same and the rate of the tax is not enhanced nor its incidence in any manner altered so that it continues to be the same tax So long as <ORG> did not pass the necessary resolutions and impose the tax there was no charge levied on the commodity so that it could not be said that the tax was being lawfully levied before the commencement of the Constitution The words was being lawfully levied obviously mean was actually levied and it would not be sufficient to satisfy those words that the Municipal authority could lawfully levy the tax but had not availed itself of that power There is another circumstance to which also reference may be made It is apparent that if the word levied were understood in the sense which Mr <NAME> contends there could be no application of the proceeds of the tax to the same pur poses as at the commencement of the Constitution In this connection learned Counsel for the respondent referred us to the decision in <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> where the relationship between the levy and the application of the tax has been referred to as an aid to the construction of the expression continue to be levied in Art We find ourselves in agreement with the views there expressed It is admitted that previous to the Constitution there was no tax imposed on gun powder In Civil Appeal of the original notification imposing terminal taxes in respect of goods coming into or going out of the municipal area by rail was one dated March which was operative from April It was this inclusion of new articles for the levy of terminal tax by the notification of and the increase in the rate of duty on articles already subjected to tax that was impugned in the writ petition filed by the respondent before <ORG> We can see no difference between the inclusion of new items and the increase in the rate of duty because if there is an increase it would not be a mere continuance of the duty which had been lawfully levied which is the only purpose and function of Art
