This appeal by special leave arises out of a consolidated reference made on the th April under section of the Indian Income tax Act read with section of the Excess Profits Tax Act by <ORG> Madras Bench The reference arose out of four several proceedings for assessment to excess profits tax of the appellant the chargeable accounting periods being periods ending with st March of each of the years and The relevant facts appearing from the consolidated statement of the case are as follows <ORG> the appellant before us hereinafter referred to as the assessee firm is a firm constituted in upon terms and conditions set forth in a deed of partnership dated the th November On the th January the company appointed as its selling agent <ORG> a firm which came into existence on the same day with <NAME> <NAME> and Dr <NAME> the three sons of <NAME> as partners each having an one third share On the facts summarised above the Excess Profits Tax Officer came to the conclusion that the main purpose of the formation of the company and the two firms of <ORG> and <ORG> was the avoidance of liability to excess profits tax He held that the three firms were really one and he therefore amalgamated the income of all three and proceeded to assess the assessee firm to excess profits tax on that basis for the four several chargeable accounting periods mentioned above In their order <ORG> considered the four following issues Whether the income of the firms styled as <ORG> and <ORG> could be amalgamated with the income of the assessee firm under the provisions of section A of the Excess Profits Tax Act Whether the share of income of Dr <NAME> a partner in the selling agency of <ORG> could be included under section A in the excess profits tax assessment of the assessee firm Whether the lease money obtained by the assessee firm could be legally treated as business profits liable to excess profits tax Whether proper opportunity under section A had been given to the assessee firm and that this was certainly an adventure in the nature of trade as contemplated by section of the Excess Profits Tax Act read with rule of Schedule I thereto The assessee firm thereupon preferred four several applications under section of the Income tax Act read with section of the Excess Profits Tax Act praying that the following questions arising out of the order of <ORG> be referred to <ORG> Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case the application of section A with a view to amalgamating the income of the firms <ORG> and <ORG> with the income of the appellant firms was correct and valid in law Whether in view of the facts admitted on record the share of income of Dr <NAME> a partner in the selling agency and not a partner in the appellant firm could be legally included along with the share of income of <NAME> and <NAME> and is this inclusion at all within the purview of section A Whether in view of the facts circumstances and observations on record the lease money obtained by the appellant firm could be legally treated as business profits or profits from an adventure in trade liable to excess profits tax Whether the type of a notice served on the appellant under the facts and the circumstances of the case legally amounts to a proper opportunity under section A of the Excess Profits Tax Act and if not what is the legal effect of such opportunity being not afforded Whether the proceedings under section A were not null and void ab initio for want of necessary previous sanction from the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax the fact of such previous sanction having been obtained being neither mentioned in the order nor proved before <ORG> at the time of hearing although expressly required by the Court <ORG> referred the earlier three questions after reforming the same so as to read as follows Whether there is any evidence before the Tribunal to support the conclusion that the main purpose of the transactions was the avoidance of excess profits tax Whether on the facts admitted or proved the share of income of Dr <NAME> in the firm of <ORG> can be legally included along with the share of income of <NAME> and <NAME> Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the leasing of machinery etc Taking up then the first question first <ORG> referred to the several facts found by <ORG> and described as steps and regarding them as circumstantial evidence came to the conclusion that it could not be said that there was no evidence upon which the <ORG> was justified in coming to the conclusion that the formation of the firms <ORG> and <ORG> was mainly for the purpose of avoidance or reduction of liability to excess profits tax After referring to section and certain judicial decisions <ORG> concluded as follows The argument of Mr <NAME> when applied to the present case would have force were it a fact that the sole concern of the assessee firm was the receipt of hire of machinery from a company or firm in which the assessee firm had no interest That question as framed proceeded on the assumption that section A applied to the case and only raised the question as to whether there was any evidence to support the finding of <ORG> arrived at as a result of the enquiry under that section namely that the main purpose of the transaction was the avoidance of excess profits tax Section which is the charging section and section which lays down the application of the Act to certain business clearly postulate the existence of a business carried on by the assessee on the profits of which the excess profits tax can be imposed Therefore if there is such a business during the relevant period then and then alone can arise the question of the applicability of section A Before the Excess Profits Tax Officer can embark upon an enquiry as to whether a transaction was effected for the avoidance or reduction of liability to excess profits tax and to make such adjustments as he considers appropriate there must be proof that the assessee was during the chargeable accounting period carrying on any business of the kind referred to in section of the Act Logically therefore <ORG> as well as <ORG> should have taken up question No first for on a decision of that question would depend the applicability of section A and if that question were answered in favour of the assessee firm the further question of law as raised in question No would not in such event arise for it had no right in the lands and buildings where the plant machinery etc that the words used in that definition are no doubt wide but underlying each of them is the fundamental idea of the continuous exercise of an activity In such a situation this Court held that that part of the assets did not cease to be commercial assets of that business since it was temporarily put to different use or let out to another and accordingly the income from the assets would be profits of the business irrespective of the manner in which that asset was exploited by the company This Court clearly indicated that no general principle could be laid down which would be applicable to all cases and that each case must be decided on its own circumstances according to ordinary common sense principles In that situation it was observed that in that case the company dealt with part of its property which had become redundant and was sublet purely to produce income a transaction quite apart from the ordinary business activities of the company The ratio decidendi in that case which was noticed in the judgment of this Court appears to us to apply to the facts found in the present case apart from the findings under section A In this view of the matter it is not necessary for us to express an opinion as to the meaning or implication of the proviso to that definition or rule of Schedule I to the Act The question of law raised in the third question being answered in favour of the assessee firm the question of the applicability of section A of the Excess Profits Tax Act could not arise for the assessee firm having during the relevant period no business to which that Act applied section A could not be invoked by the revenue and therefore the question whether there was evidence to support the finding of the <ORG> under that section could not arise and we answer the question so reframed in the negative We also answer question No in the negative The appellant will be entitled to the costs of this appeal and we order accordingly
