Addl Having regard to this representation we answer the second question in the affirmative i in favour of the assessee and against the <ORG> So far as the first question is concerned a few facts may be noticed The assessee was valuing its closing stock in the past years by what is known as the total cost method While valuing the closing stock for the assessment year under consideration the assessee found the earlier system to be somewhat unscientific and problematic and therefore switched on to what is recognised as the works cost system where administrative overheads are not taken into account While scrutinising the accounts for the assessment year under consideration the Income tax Officer went into the question of the closing stock valuation and found that the assessee adopted a different method for valuation of the closing stock He valued the closing stock on the basis adopted in the past year and made an addition of the difference in the value of the closing stock The assessee objected to the direction of the Commissioner of Income tax by filing an appeal before the <ORG> and submitted that where on an investigation and inquiry the <ORG> authorities are satisfied that the change in the method of valuation of closing stock is brought about for bona fide purposes the <ORG> has no right to interfere with the valuation of the closing stock The <ORG> accepted the assessee plea and in particular it had taken note of the fact that any disturbance in the valuation of the opening stock would have a snowballing effect in the sense that the closing stock of the immediately preceding year would be affected and the computation of profits of that year would have to undergo a change and this process would go on for a number of years We have not the slightest doubt that the view of the <ORG> was correct
