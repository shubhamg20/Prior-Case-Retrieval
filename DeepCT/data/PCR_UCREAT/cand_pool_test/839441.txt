Powers of <ORG> to issue writ when Income tax Officer jurisdiction to issue notice under of the Indian Income tax Act is questioned <ORG> must not re appraise evidence Subsequently <ORG> took view that the sale of goods by the firm to the families was only a device to divert the profits of the firm and on this view issued notices under of the Incometax Act requiring the assessee to show cause why the assessments for the years and should not be reopened Held i The <ORG> may issue a high prerogative writ prohibiting the Income tax Officer from proceeding with reassessment when it appears that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to commence proceedings because the conditions precedent do not exist ii The condition which invests the Income tax Officer with jurisdiction has two branches i that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and ii that it is in consequence of information which he has in his possession and that he has reason so to believe The expression information in the context of which it occurs must mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment If he has such information the Income tax Officer may commence proceedings under But to commence such a proceeding it is not necessary that on the materials which came to the notice of the Income tax Officer the previous order of assessment was vitiated by some error of fact or law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The assessees <ORG> are dealers in mill stores in the course of their business they sell mill stores to other dealers including two concerns trading in the names of A <NAME> Co The assessees in reply contended that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to reopen the assessments since the Hindu undivided families of the two partners and the assessees had submitted effect and complete returns of income supported by their books of account quantity details of purchases sales and expenses and had given all material facts and relevant information necessary for assessment at the time of each assessment The Income tax Officer issued three separate notices under of the Income tax Act requiring the assessees to show cause why the assessments for the years and should not be reopened The material part of may be read If a notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may subject to the provisions of sections to assess or reassess such income or recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance as the case may be for the assessment year concerned Explanation For the purposes of this section the following shall also be deemed to be cases where income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment namely a where income chargeable to tax has been underassessed or Under reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment in consequence of information in the possession of the Income tax Officer is a condition precedent to the exercise of his jurisdiction to assess or reassess the income of the assessee At <NAME> delivering the majority judgment of the <ORG> observed It is well settled however that though the writ of prohibition or certiorari will not issue against an executive authority <ORG> have power to issue in a fit case an order prohibiting an executive authority from acting without jurisdiction Where such action of an exe cutive authority acting without jurisdiction subjects or is likely to subject a person to lengthy proceedings and unnecessary harassment <ORG> it is well settl ed will issue appropriate orders or directions to prevent such consequences <ORG> may therefore issue a high prerogative writ prohibiting the Income tax Officer from proceeding with re assessment when it appears that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to commence proceeding The condition which invests the Income tax Officer with jurisdiction has two branches i that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and ii that it is in consequence of information which he has in his possession and that he has reason so to believe Since the learned Judges of <ORG> have concentrated their attention upon the second branch of the condition and have reached their conclusion in favour of the assessees on that branch it would be appropriate to deal with the correctness of that approach The expression information in the context in which it occurs must in our judgment mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment If as a result of information in his possession the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment the Income tax Officer has jurisdiction to assess or reassess income under of the Income tax Act Information in his possession that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment furnishes a starting point for assessing or reassessing income If he has that information the Income tax Officer may commence proceedings for assessment or reassessment To commence the proceeding for reassessment it is not necessary that on the materials which came to the notice of the Income tax Officer the pre vious order of assessment was vitiated by some error of fact or law of the Constitution has power to set aside a notice issued under of the Income tax Act if the condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction does not exist The <ORG> may in exercise of its powers ascertain whether the Income tax Officer had in his possession any information the <ORG> may also determine whether from that information the Income tax Officer may have reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment The Incometax Officer alone is entrusted with the power to administer the Act if he has information from which it may be said prima facie that lie had reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment it is not open to the High <ORG> exercising powers under Art Justification of the Income tax Officer to reassess income arises if he has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment <ORG> was also of the view that the inference raised by the Income tax Officer that the Hindu undivided families of the assessees had made profit by sale of articles purchased from the assessees larger than the profit which the assessees had made was not justified since there was no evidence on the record about the price at which similar goods were sold by the assessees to other merchants and about the profit which those other merchants made by sale of those goods The averments made in the affidavit filed by the Income tax Officer in that behalf do not establish the existence of that branch of the condition In reply to the averment by the assessees that the Income tax Officer had no reason to believe that income had escaped assessment the Income tax Officer stated In the course of the discussions I had at the several meetings hereinabove referred I also learnt that in the earlier years also the petitioners the assessees had effected such sales to the said Hindu undivided families and that over and above the margin of profits earned by the petitioners the assessees from the Hindu undivided families the Hindu undivided families had earned substantial profits on the resale of such goods By adopting a device if it is made to appear that income which belonged to the assessee had been earned by some other person that income may be brought to tax in the hands of the assessee and if the income has escaped tax in a previous assessment a case for commencing a proceeding for reassessment under may be made out If the goods were nominally transferred to the Hindu undivided families the latter acting merely as benamdars for the assessees and the profits were earning in truth by the assessees income earned by sale of the goods by the Hindu undivided families may be held chargeable to tax as income which has escaped assessment to tax in the hands of the assessees had no reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for the three years in question
