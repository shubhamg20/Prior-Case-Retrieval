They required to be replace frequently as due to the high degree of wear and tear and due to the high pressure and temperature they required constant replacement An option was however given to the assessee to redeem the goods by payment of fines Further he made a pointed reference to the fact that no evidence was brought on record but the department to how that the assessee had acted in an unlawful manner in carrying on its business Had the assessee acted in an unlawful manner there was no doubt that the imported goods would have been confiscated and would not have been released for the use in the assessees business Further reference was also made to the fact that the assessees entire plant and machinery were value at about Rs We have carefully considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments on either side In our opinion there is certain element of uncertainty in the definition of the word spare In the case of <ORG> supra the <ORG> has held that the actual cost of the goods to the assessee was no only what it had paid to the importers but in addition thereto what it had to pay by way of penalty in order to save the goods from being confiscated and lost to it In the case of <ORG> supra the facts as observed by <ORG> were that the penalty had been imposed not for the fault of the assessee but it had to bear the penalty for the purpose of getting the goods released from the customs authorities Apart from that since in our opinion the assessees case is fully covered by <ORG> decision on the subject we see no reason to look to the law as explained by any other <ORG> form guidance in deciding these appeals on this issue In the circumstances we see no reason to interfere with the order of the Commissioner Appeals on this issue For the assessment year there are some more grounds which included an amount or Rs As per the terms of the agreement it was agreed between the parties that the annual profit bonus for the accounting year ending December had to be paid at an amount equivalent to per cent of the salary or wages earned by the employees during the accounting year and such bonus was to be calculated on the actual salary of Rs The assessee claimed the deduction under section ii and section He proceeded to bring to our notice that under section of the Payment of Bonus Act the assessee was under an obligation to pay a bonus of per cent of the salary or wages earned by the employee or Rs He has proceeded to argue that according to the proviso to section ii the deduction in respect of the bonus paid to an employee employed in a factory or other establishment to which the provisions of the Payment of Bonus Act applied should not exceed the amount of bonus payable under that act According to him since under the Payment of Bonus Act the assessee could have paid a bonus of per cent of the salary or wages earned by each individual employee the Commissioner Appeals could not have made an allowance of bonus to the extent of per cent of the salary or wages of the employees section it would have been clear that where the allocable surplus for any accounting year exceeded the amount of minimum bonus payable to the employees under that section the employer was under an obligation to pay to every employee in respect of that accounting year bonus which would be an amount in proportion to the salary or wages earned by the employee during the accounting year subject to a maximum of per cent of such salary or wages earned by the employee during the year We have carefully considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments on either side The facts lie within a narrow compass The assessee was under an obligation to pay bonus to the employees at the rate of per cent of the salary and wages under a contract Further in addition to the roads connecting the various plant installations there are also other roads connecting the other buildings in the complex We have carefully considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments on either side We have also taken note of the fact that the <ORG> in IT Appeal Nos to of Bom On completion of the assessment there is no mention in the assessment order but in the demand notice the <ORG> demanded some amount by way of interest under section a It was submitted on behalf of the assessee before the Commissioner Appeals that the <ORG> was not entitled to levy any interest either under section or under section A in the circumstances narrated above He therefore set aside the order of the <ORG> on this point only with a direction to him to go through the assessees claim and pass necessary order after verifying the facts While doing so the <ORG> should also give credit to the installments paid by the assessee on which apparently was not taken into consideration by the <ORG> while imposing the levy We have carefully considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments on either side We find that the learned judges of <ORG> have held against the assessee in the case of <NAME> supra only on the ground that the assessee had not denied the liability to the levy whereas we have got the decision of the Full Bench of the same <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra to the effect that where the assessee had denied the liability outright under section the assessee was entitled to challenged the levy From the terms of the order of the Commissioner Appeals it is clear that the Commissioner Appeals was fully aware of <ORG> decision in the case of <ORG> supra and in terms he has followed it We there fore see no substance in the appeal on behalf of the revenue on any of the grounds on this issue
