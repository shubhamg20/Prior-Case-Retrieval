The above writ petition has been filed for the issue of a writ of certiorari to call for and quash the proceedings of the third respondent in A No CBE dated It is claimed that under a mistake of law excise duty was paid on those goods under tariff item I of the <ORG> Tariff The petitioners also claimed that they buy the duty paid pipes and merely bend or process the pipes and coming to know of the orders of <ORG> New Delhi dated issued in the matter of The second respondent before whom the said application for refund was filed issued a notice dated proposing to reject the claim as time barred under Section of the Central Excises and Salt Act and the petitioners submitted their objections on contending that the commodity manufactured by them was not excisable since the pipes had already suffered duty and not only there cannot be any fresh duty but the duty paid was under a total mistake and consequently no period of limitation will apply to make their claim In the affidavit filed in support of the above writ petition it is contended that under Section of the Act the Collector of Central Excise has to direct the very adjudicating authority whose decision or order calls for determination to apply to the Collector Appeals and does not empower any other authority to file an appeal and consequently the appeal filed by the different authority than the adjudicating authority is non est It is also contended that the application can be only to seek a reference and cannot be treated as an outright revision appeal to set aside an order of the adjudicating authority and the third respondent has only power to decide the issue and remit the matter with his opinion to the adjudicating authority to pass consequential orders and cannot by himself set aside the order It is also contended in the said affidavit that the appellate authority exercising powers Under Section A of the Act can merely decide an issue and refer a case to the adjudicating authority and thereafter the procedure contemplated under Section A of the Act has to be followed The respondents have filed a counter affidavit contending that the petitioners are manufacturers of elbows reducers tees which are pipe fittings in their factory at Hosur that on the basis of the classification list submitted by the petitioners those goods were classified under tariff item and accordingly the petitioners were paying duty and that when subsequently the petitioners sought for reclassification of their products under tariff item AA iv by filing a revised classification list on the claim was considered and accepted by the Assistant Collector <ORG> Hosur While accepting the position that thereafter the petitioners filed a refund claim for the period between to it is contended that there was no protest or objection from the petitioners for classification of their products under I till when the revised classification list was filed and that therefore any claim for refund of any duty of excise has to be considered in the context of the provisions contained under Section of the <ORG>s and Salt Act Consequently it is also contended that the refund claim should have been made within a period of six months from the relevant date namely the date of payment of duty and inasmuch as the refund claim was received by the second respondent only on a portion of the claim pertaining to the period from to was found to be inadmissible in view of the bar of limitation prescribed under Section of the Act and it is only on that account a sum of Rs pertaining to the period from to alone was sanctioned for refund to the petitioners and so far as the claim for the period prior to is concerned a notice was issued to the petitioners to show cause against why the claim for refund for the period prior to should not be rejected as hit by the bar of limitation contained in Section of the Act It is also stated that the petitioners had an effective alternative remedy by filing an appeal before the Tribunal <ORG> and therefore the writ petition is not maintainable While traversing the various pleas raised in the affidavit to challenge the impugned order the respondents contend that <ORG> or the Authorised Officer can make the application to <ORG> or the Collector Appeals that the plea based on the absence of notice is misconceived that the procedure prescribed under Section of the Act has been directly complied with in forwarding a copy of the appeal filed and also by inviting cross objections from the petitioners and giving a personal hearing before passing final orders by the Appellate Collector and that no further show cause notice is contemplated under Section of the Act The respondents also contend that there is vast and substantial difference between the procedure to be followed in disposing of an appeal filed under Section A of the Act and the exercise of powers under Section of the Act It is also contended that the forwarding of the copy of the appeal and the opportunity given to file a cross objection constitute sufficient compliance with law and there was no need for any further show cause notice to be issued and that the plea of the petitioners to the contra would run counter to the stipulations contained in Section of the Act The respondents also deny the claim of the petitioners that the Collector of Central Excise Appeals exercising powers under Section of the Act can only decide and remand back to the original authority and cannot set aside the order and there is no such restriction warranted in the provisions contained in Section either expressly or by implication It is also contended that the specific stipulation of a period of limitation under Section of the Act was with a view to prevent unjust enrichment in cases where the parties have collected the money from their consumers as duty of excise either intentionally or by mistake of law and subsequently claim them also from the department irrespective of any time limit and consequently there was nothing unconstitutional about the impugned orders passed by the Appellate Collector Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the petitioners contended as follows That having regard to the provisions contained in Section A and the proviso to the said Section conferring power upon the Assistant Collector within months and the Collector under certain circumstances within a period of five years there is no scope for having recourse to Section of the Act for the recovery of the duty erroneously refunded It is also contended that even when a direction under Section is issued the Collector of Appeals can in the appeal filed only determine about the legality of the order passed under Section and there is no power in the Collector of Appeals to issue a positive direction for repayment or recovery of the duty erroneously refunded earlier de hors Section A of the Act The further submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that even assuming that the Collector of Appeals while disposing of the appeal under Section could have passed orders under Section A for the recovery of the duty erroneously refunded the same could not have been done without complying with the requirements of the proviso by issuing a show cause notice and also complying with Section A of the Act The entire stand of the petitioner is built upon the supremacy of Section A of the Act and that even Section of the Act is subject to Section A of the Act and without conforming to the stipulations and conditions contained in Section A no positive order for recovery of the duty erroneously refunded could be passed under any provisions of the Act and particularly Section Mr <NAME> learned Counsel appearing for the respondents contended that in view of the direction by the Collector to file an appeal to <NAME> and the issue of notice of appeal with a direction to file cross objections if any to the demand made by the department there is no need to again have recourse to or comply with the stipulations contained in Section A of the Act It is also the contention of the learned Counsel for the department that the powers under Section A and the appellate as well as revisional powers conferred under the other provisions like Sections A etc Finally the learned Counsel contended that while setting aside the order under Section the competent authority entrusted with such power has as a necessary corollary to inevitably also pass orders for the return or repayment or recovery of the duty erroneously refunded When any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded a Central Excise Officer may within six months from the relevant date serve notice on the person chargeable with the duty which has not been levied or paid or which has been short levied or short paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice Provided that where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded by reason of fraud collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts or contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of the rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duty by such person or his agent the provisions of this sub section shall have effect as if for the words six months the words five years were substituted Explanation Where the service of the notice is stayed by an order of a <ORG> the period of such stay shall be excluded in computing the aforesaid period of six months or five years as the case may be The Collector Appeals may after making such further inquiry as may be necessary pass such order as he thinks fit confirming modifying or annulling the decision or order appealed against or may refer the case back to the adjudicating authority with such directions as he may think fit for a fresh adjudication or decision as the case may be after taking additional evidence if necessary Provided that an order enhancing any penalty or fine in lieu of confiscation or confiscating goods of greater value or reducing the amount of refund shall not be passed unless the appellant has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed order Provided further that where the Collector Appeals is of opinion that any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded no order requiring the appellant to pay any duty not levied or paid short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded shall be passed unless the appellant is given notice within the time limit specified in Section A to show cause against the proposed order The order of the Collector Appeals disposing of the appeal shall be in writing and shall state the points for determination the decision thereon and the reason for the decision Powers of <ORG> or Collector of Central Excise to pass certain orders The <ORG> may of its own motion call for and examine the record of any proceeding in which a Collector of Central Excise as an adjudicating authority has passed any decision or order under this Act for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any such decision or order and may by order direct such Collector to apply to <ORG> for the determination of such points arising out of the decision or order as may be specified by the <ORG> in its order No order shall me made under Sub section or Sub section after the expiry of one year from the date of the decision or order of the adjudicating authority Before adjudicating upon the issues raised it would be useful to refer to the various judicial pronouncements and the opinion of the Tribunals pressed into service by the counsel appearing on either side to substantiate their respective stands While considering the case of a claim by the <ORG> Officer for payment of duty erroneously refunded by the department the Division Bench of <ORG> held it was required to be taken under Section of the said Act within three months from the relevant date and that the period of limitation prescribed under Section A cannot override the express provision in Section which limits the issue of notice of demand for payment of duties not levied or short levied or erroneously refunded to a period of three months To come to such a conclusion the learned Judges considered that there was really no conflict between Sections and A that whereas Chapter comprising Section deals with rights and liabilities Chapter XVII in which Section A occurs contains procedural provisions that where a general intention as well as a particular intention has been expressed in the Act and both are incompatible with each other the particular intention is to be considered as an exception to the general one and consequently the period of limitation prescribed under Section must prevail and cannot therefore be destroyed or overridden by Section A and the limitation stipulated therein <ORG> held that before any demand was made on any person chargeable in respect of non levy or short levy or under payment of duty a notice requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amounts specified in the notice must be served on him and the admitted absence of a prior show cause notice vitiated the impugned proceedings in that case which provided for the collection of duty levied on the production of a commodity at an intermediate stage of an integrated process of manufacture of another commodity by deeming such production or manufacture of the commodity at an intermediate stage to be removal from such place or premises of manufacture While repelling a challenge based upon Articles and of the Constitution of India <ORG> held as follows Under Section A the excise authorities cannot recover duties not levied or not paid or short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded beyond the period of six months the proviso to Section A not being applicable in the present case it should be held that it overrides the provision of Section A Section does not contain any non obstante clause nor does it refer to the provision Section of A In the circumstances it is difficult to hold that Section overrides the provision of Section A There is no provision in the Act or in the Rules enabling the excise authorities to make any demand beyond the periods mentioned in Section A of the Act on the ground of the accrual of cause of action In our view Section does not in any manner affect the provision of Section A of the Act In the absence of any specific provision overriding Section A it will be consistent with rules of harmonious construction to hold that Section Finance Act insofar as it gives retrospective effect to the amendments made to Rules and of the Rules is subject to the provision of Section A So far as the decisions of <ORG> referred to before me are concerned they had no occasion to deal with or decide the issue that is relevant or raised before me in this case The impact of an interaction of the said provision with the provision contained in Section A and Section was not at all considered in any of the decisions of <ORG> but were in issue and considered only in the opinion expressed by some of the <ORG> and whereas the branch of the <ORG> at South had taken a view favourable to the <ORG> the Branch of <ORG> took a view supporting the stand point of an assessee manufacturer supra would go to show that greater emphasis and effect was given by them only to Section A at the expense and in derogation of Section of the Act and in utter disregard of the jurisdiction of the authority exercising powers under Section of the Act While the orders of the <ORG> proceeded to hold that there is nothing in any part of the Act that can counteract Section A and that resort to Section cannot have the effect of nullifying Section A and the time limit stipulated therein and that such an interpretation would have the effect of rendering Section A otiose they have totally lost sight of the position that dovetailing Section A into Section would equally have the effect of nullifying and making Section wholly redundant and would also result in completely obliterating the said provision from the statute itself Section A of the Act confers powers upon a Central Excise Officer in the nature of a review or reconsideration though the proviso confers powers under certain specified circumstances upon the Collector of Central Excise It is only the Collector of Appeals who has been conferred powers under Section A in an appeal filed by an assessee and again under Section in respect of a proceeding instituted by the department In view of the above one provision is not and cannot be also derogatory of the other either in respect of the power or the authority entrusted with such power under different provisions of the Act Regarding the availability of more than one remedy and the manner in which it could be invoked or exercised it was held as follows <ORG> has in its judgment assumed that whenever a specific remedy is made available in law the other remedy more general in nature necessarily gets excluded So far the question of limitation is concerned it is true that as in the Delhi Act a period of six years was fixed under the Bihar Act also by second proviso under Section which reads thus Provided further that no order shall be passed under this sub section in respect of any act or omission mentioned in Clause a or except within six years of the date on which such act or omission occurred Even if the proviso be assumed to govern a dispute between the society and its past or present officer or servant it cannot come to the aid of the present respondent because he was dismissed from service on October and he was directed to deposit the disputed amount within days therefrom No reliance therefore can be placed on either Section or Therefore if action could be taken under one section it does not follow that action could not be taken under the other Section provides for the examination of the order passed by a subordinate authority under certain provisions set out therein So long as the jurisdiction is exercised with respect to an order contemplated by the section there would be no error in the exercise of jurisdiction <ORG> also held on the relative scope of Sections and in the following terms On a consideration of the above decisions we are of the view that Sections and of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act are independent and the limitation prescribed under Section will not be applicable to a revision under Section of the Act and in any event in this case since the original assessment was not revised under Section the limitation prescribed under Section will not be applicable to a revision under Section Further we are of the view that Section gives wide power to reassess the turnover as in the case of the original assessing authority The exercise of powers so far as the present case before us is concerned is one in our view squarely coming within the four corners of suo motu revisional powers conferred upon the Joint Commissioner under Section of the Act and consequently there is no merit whatsoever in the plea made on behalf of the appellants that it has also to satisfy the period of limitation as prescribed under Section of the Act Consequently in my view there is absolutely no warrant or justification to restrict the scope and amplitude of the powers of the Collector of Appeals under Section by reading into it the provisions of Section A of the Act Such a construction is not permissible under any known or well accepted principles of interpretation governing similar provisions particularly in fiscal enactment and while construing provisions meant to prevent evasion of tax liability The specific stipulation in Section that such application shall be heard by <ORG> or the Collector Appeals as the case may be as if such application were an appeal made against the decision or order of the adjudicating authority does not have the consequence of converting it as a regular appeal of an assessee subject to all the stipulations including those which are required to be observed in passing an order against the interests of an assessee in his appeal In an application filed under Section on the directions of the Collector of <ORG> the very issue would be against the interests of the assessee who has not himself filed an appeal and there is no scope or occasion for forming an opinion by <ORG> and then issuing any notice to the assessee The deeming of the application filed under Section as if it were an appeal is only for such limited purpose and the same cannot be enlarged beyond its legitimate purpose The submission for the petitioner to the contrary has no substance or merit whatsoever So far as the facts and circumstances of the case are concerned there is no dispute that the impugned order came to be passed within the six months period visualised under Section A and that notice of the application filed under Section was also served upon the petitioner calling upon him also to file his cross objections if any and he was fully heard and then orders have been passed and communicated to the petitioner also There is no need to follow the procedure prescribed under Section A once over again There is also no substance or merit in the plea that the authority exercising power under Section can only set aside the order of the adjudicating authority and cannot direct refund to the <ORG> or order recovery of the amount erroneously refunded When the very order as in this case that is the subject matter in issue in the application filed under Section is the earlier order of refund passed by the adjudicating authority and the legality and propriety of passing such an order while the Collector of Appeals sets aside such an order the Collector of Appealls shall be entitled as of necessity to direct the return or repayment or recovery of the money erroneously refunded
