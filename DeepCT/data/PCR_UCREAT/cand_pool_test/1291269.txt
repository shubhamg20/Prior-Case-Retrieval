This is a plaintiff appeal arising out of an order made on an application for the grant at an interim injunction It carries on its business throughout India The plaintiff therefore sued for the grant of a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from selling the disputed flash lights in the market and for other reliefs and also applied for a temporary injunction to the same effect Moreover the fact that there was phonetic similarity between EveReady and LitReady would not invest the plaintiff with a right to claim an interim injunction It has been urged by the learned counse for the plaintiff appellant that the learned Judge of the Court below was not correct when he made observations with regard to the phonetic similarity being of no avail to the plaintiff and with regard to the plaintiff not possessing any property right in the shell of the flash lights Learned counsel has urged that the suit was not merely for the breach of the trade mark but also for the damage caused to the plaintiff by the defendants passing off his goods as those of the plaintiff In our opinion what we have to see in a case of this kind when an interim injunction is sought during the pendency of the suit before the rights of the parties are finally decided is first whether a prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff in respect of his claim and secondly whether the balance of convenience demands that the injunction should be issued The only differences that one can see on a close examination of the two flash lights are firstly that while in the plaintiff torch there is the word Eve Ready in the defendants torch there is the word LitReady The only other difference on the bottom cap of the torch is in respect of the words made in A which appear in the plaintiff torch while we find the words made in India in the defendants torch To the same effect are the observations of <NAME> in Ralli Fleming Cal at In this particular case I do not think that their keeping an account of sales would be a sufficient protection to the plaintiffs because if the defendants were allowed to use these marks in the market for several months in order to sell their cloth they would become as well known in the market as importers and sellers of the cloth as the plaintiffs and so the very mischief which the injunction is intended to guard against would have been effected We therefore allow this appeal set aside the order of the <ORG> below and restrain the defendants their servants and agents from selling the torch lights in dispute or manufacturing them during the pendency of the suit The plaintiff appellant will have the costs of this appeal from the defendants respondents
