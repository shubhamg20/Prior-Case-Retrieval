In order to do that we have to examine the terms of the pattah by which the <NAME> Chakran lands were granted to <NAME> Further there is this provision in the pattah If in future it transpires that any other person or persons besides yourself has or have putni interest in the said lot <NAME> he or they will acquire putni interest in these Chakran lands also in the game manner and to the same extent as they may be found to have in the said lot Upon these it is contended that far from separating these lands from the original putni it was the intention of the parties that the <NAME> Chakran lands should be considered as part and parcel of the putni and it was intended to nullify any contention that this was a separate property because at that time it was considered doubtful whether the original putni of <NAME> included the <NAME> Chakran lands and whether the putnidar as such was entitled to those lands being transferred to the Zamindar by the Collector under the <NAME> Act It seems to me that this contention of the appellant is sound It is however contended on behalf of the respondents that these provisions constitute a contract between the Zamindar and the putnidar and cannot be enforced by a third person It seems to me however that it is not a question of contract The contention on behalf of the defendants respondents is that <NAME> had express authority to transfer these <NAME> lands under the terms of the pattah and reference is made to the terms by which it is provided what should happen if these lands are transferred by the grantee The provision runs thus If the land be transferred by gift sale or succession the costs whatever may be incurred by the <NAME> estate for making an enquiry as to who is the person in possession for the time or whatever loss may be suffered by the <NAME> estate on account of the name of the present occupier not being registered shall be paid by the present occupier without objection If that is so then the plaintiff would by virtue of her purchase be entitled to these <NAME> Chakran lands as forming part of the original putni of <NAME> which was created in It was further contended on behalf of the respondents that in the sale proclamation these <NAME> Chakran lands were not mentioned and the rent which was stated to be due on account of the putni was the amount pay able under the original putni grant of converted into the current coin that the extra amount of Rs The judgment and decree of the Subordinate Judge must therefore be set aside and the plaintiff suit decreed with costs both in this <ORG> as well as in the lower <ORG>
