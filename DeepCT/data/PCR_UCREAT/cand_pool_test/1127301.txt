By Order Rule they were not required to join the first mortgagee in his suit and he was not joined accordingly though they must have known that there was a first mortgage on the A schedule property as it was registered In this state of affairs the defendant brought his suit on the first mortgage in No of without impleading the second mortgagee and obtained a decree and in execution bought the properties in A and schedules himself on st October and obtained possession in January As he could not get possession he brought this suit in The second issue sufficiently covered this point and the third issue raised the question of defendant improvements The second issue which raised the question whether the plaintiff or the defendant was entitled to redeem the other and keep the property was thus dropped and with it the third issue was also dropped The only issue left was whether the plaintiff was entitled to unconditional possession The meaning and effect of this is that the defendant is not entitled to use his mortgage as a shield to protect his possession and that though the plaintiff as second mortgagee has only rights to the property subject to the first mortgage the latter must enforce such rights as he may still have by another suit and in the meanwhile give up possession another Bench consisting of Coutts Trotter and <NAME> <ORG> Muhammad Usan Row than <NAME> I and <NAME> <NAME> I and that these decisions must not be followed and laid down seven rules to determine the rights of two simple mortgagees suing separately each on his own mortgage I do not propose to enter more than is necessary to decide this case into the general aspects of this controversy about the right of puisne mortgagees who have not been impleaded in the prior mortgagee suit to bring suits for sale subject to prior encumbrances Even learned Judges if I may say so with respect have been naturally unable to lay down the rules of law governing these questions in judgments pronounced by them in particular cases with all the necessary qualifications and limitations which would have to be applied to those rules if additional facts and circumstances of a special nature besides those appearing in the particular cases in which the decisions were given were involved therein In the other cases it was found that the form of the suit which was in ejectment precluded the real dispute between the parties being determined i as to the order of mutual redemption of the mortgages and the consequence of default But the latter case would appear to take the view that in such circumstances the puisne mortgagee has not merely the right to redeem but also the right to sell subject to the prior mortgage There were two simple mortgages of and He agreed that the auction purchaser in execution of a prior mortgagee decree without impleading the subsequent mortgagee acquires the right of the mortgagor including the right of possession In the former case there were two simple mortgages in and to <NAME> and a third mortgage by conditional sale in to <NAME> In <NAME> brought a suit on the first two mortgages without making <NAME> a party and bought the property himself Her security therefore included the right of <NAME> by that purchase which included the right of the st and nd mortgagees It was therefore ordered that <ORG> should in the first instance pay the amount of the first and second mortgages to <NAME> that in case he did so the plaintiff should pay to <ORG> the amount of his third mortgage of and if she did so she could have the usual mortgage decree for the entire sum of all the mortgages including her own At it is stated that if a first mortgagee who has first obtained a decree without joining the second mortgagee purchases the property in execution after the second mortgagee has brought his suit on his own mortgage such purchase would be affected by lis pendens and that such a purchaser would have to give up possession to the later purchaser in the second mortgagee suit Not only so but I find difficulty in understanding how a mortgage suit brought by a first mortgagee can be affected by lis pendens because some one else who does not claim from him i another mortgagee has already sued to enforce his own rights It is that the rule only applies to transfers by the plaintiff or defendant of their respective interests after the suit including transfers by Court sale in money decrees against either party For the above reasons the decrees of the Lower Courts are reversed and the suit dismissed with costs throughout He has in this Court been given every opportunity of settling but has not taken advantage of it
