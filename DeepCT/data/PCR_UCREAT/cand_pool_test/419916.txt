Sub Section of as it stood after the amendment provided that <ORG> shall levy and collect market fee from every seller in respect of agricultural produce sold by such seller in the market area at the rate of one rupee per hundred rupees of the price of such produce sold Section was amended with retrospective effect from by substituting in clause ii of sub section of the words transport and marketing for the word marketing The High <ORG> held that as substituted by the Act of and of the Amendment Act were unconstitutional and liable to be struck down on the grounds that before was struck down the levy and collection of market fee under as it then stood were for the benefit of <ORG> constituted under the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act and that event which had happened namely crediting of the market fee to that Fund cannot be reversed by the subsequent amendment of and introduction of in the Amendment Act of ii that as per the decision of the Supreme <ORG> in <NAME> case rural roads are primarily and essentially intended for the benefit of the public and the class of market fee payers are as part of the general public entitled to the benefit of their user and the market fees cannot be levied on and collected from them for that purpose more so because the rural roads constructed improved repaired and maintained with the market fee collected did not become the property of the market committees or shed their character as public roads that sub section does not confer uncanalised and excessive power on market committees in the matter of fixing the rate of market fee and that there are adequate statutory guidelines and safeguards that on the materials placed the levy ought nor to fail for want of quid pro quo However the Chief Marketing Officer direction can be regarded as his previous sanction for amending the bye laws the question whether must be held to imply an obligation on the part of the market committees to hear affected interested parties before the rate of fee was fixed was left open in the judgment that the provisions of the Act in so far as marketing of cardamom is concerned are repugnant to the provisions of the Cardamom Act Central Act of but so far as the provisions of the Tobacco Board Act Central Act are concerned it makes provisions only in relation to Virginia tobacco and not all varities of tobacco and the Act is not repugnant to the provisions of the Tobacco Board Act and all that is necessary for <ORG> is to obtain auctioneer licence under the provisions of the Tobacco Board Act However the amount collected under that sub section will take care of the proposed expenditure envisaged in the estimates and projections for the improvement of the services in the regulated markets and ii that reduction of the enhanced levy from two per cent to one per cent subsequently by <ORG> shows that there was no justification for the enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent that the amendment of the bye laws made for enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent was not in accordance with the procedure laid down by of the Act and ss a and of Ordinance of promulgated during the pendency of the writ petitions in the High <ORG> would not cure the defect that as substituted by Act of read with of the Amending Act seeking to validate the collection of market fee on sellers made under the old of the Act is constitutionally invalid and the High <ORG> erred in holding that the Tobacco Board Act covers only Virginia tobacco and is not repugnant to the provisions of ss a and of the Tobacco Board Act and of the Rules made under that Act On behalf of the respondents it was contended that quid pro quo was established in respect of out of market committees falling in categories A and for enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent and no further enquiry was needed in view of <NAME> case that there is no repugnancy between the Act and the Tobacco Board Act that after has been omitted from the Act there was no question of striking down as substituted by the Amendment Act of and since of the Amendment Act has validated the levy there is no question of refund of the market fee collected under Dismissing all the civil appeals special leave petitions and the writ petitions except A No of It is also well settled that where two Acts one passed by the <ORG> and the other by a State legislature collide and there is no question of harmonising them then the Central legislation must prevail It is manifest therefore that by virtue of the aforesaid steps taken by the central legislation the field of tobacco stood completely occupied and there was no room for application of the doctrine of pith and substance nor would the question of incidental entrenchment arise in such cases This being the position this Court strikes down that part of the Karnataka Act which takes in itself the power to levy market fee on tobaco or its products Even if the products may be sold in the markets in Karnataka or near about the same place situated in that States the power to levy fee will not belong to that State it will remain with the <ORG> which would regulate the sale and purchase of tobacco On the construction of the Central Act read with the rules it is clear that the Central Act and the declaration made by section of the Act cover all kinds of tobac cos The constitutional scheme is that <ORG> has full and exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List I and has also power to legislate with respect to matters in List III <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List II excluding the matters falling in List I and has also concurrent power to legislate with respect to matters falling in List III excluding the matters falling in List I The dominant position of <ORG> with regard to matters in List I and List III is established A legislation falling exclusively in its pith and substance within any of the entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule would be within the exclusive competence of <ORG> A Central law which in its pith and substance falls within any entry in List I would be valid even though it might contain incidental provisions in List II which may contain ancillary provisions which might touch on any entry of List I incidentally A State law which in its pith and substance is within any entry in List II would be valid even though it might incidentally touch upon a subject falling within List I A Central law which in its pith and substance dealt with a subject falling within List II would be bad and ultra vires the Constitution Similarly a State law which in its pith and substance dealt with a matter falling within List I would be invalid and ultra vires the Constitution and The concept of repugnancy arises only with regard to laws dealing with subjects covered by the entries falling in List III in respect of which both <ORG> and <ORG> are competent to legislate While it is true that in the spheres very carefully delineated the <ORG> has supremacy over <ORG> Legislatures supremacy in the sense that in those fields <ORG>ary legislation would hold the field and not the <ORG> legislation but to denude the <ORG> Legislature of its power to legislate where the legislation in question in pith and substance i in its true nature and character belongs to the <ORG> field one should be chary to denude the <ORG> of its power to legislate and mobilise resources because that would be destructive of the spirit and purpose of India being a Union of <ORG>s <ORG>s must have power to raise and mobilise resources in their exclusive fields The State Act is not on a subject in List III nor is the Central Act a law relating to any subject in List III There is nothing in the Act or in the Rules which indicate that it is inconsistent with or cannot be operated along with the marketing regulations ii It is fully manifest that both Act can operate in their respective fields and there is no repugnancy if both the Acts are considered in the light of their respective true nature and character Thus it is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule which would apply for all times to come In the instant case though the fee appears to be on the higher side but there is unimpeachable evidence to show that the entire amount realised has not been spent on some other object or purpose but has been kept in reserve for developing the markets during the course of the coming years Though this period is large but it cannot be said that there is no nexus between the services rendered and the fee realised Whether the development takes place immediately or in the course of a few years so long as it is done within a reasonable period it cannot be said that the fee amounts to a tax and is therefore ultra vires Section did not confer any arbitrary power and there was no excessive delegation of legislative power to the market committees and therefore not vitiated on that account The question whether on a proper construction of section there was any obligation on the part of the marketing committee to hear the parties was rightly left upon by <ORG> with certain observations and directions contained in its judgment The principle of audi alteram partem has application only to judicial quasi judicial and administrative functions and not to any legislative functions In the instant case having regard to the detailed analysis of the expenditure of the various market committees it could not be said that the expenditure and appropriation of fee was so disproportionate to the projects actual and projected that it could be said that the levy lost the character of fee If without rural roads markets could not be reached and the functions for which the market committees were constituted could not be performed if it is of fundamental importance that there should be a net work of roadways if effective aid is to be given to buyers and sellers of goods for marketing their products then the fact that the public streets and roads as trustees would be of no consequence in considering such realisation as fee The Act which sought to validate the levy contributed to <ORG> was for the maintenance of rural roads which forms an integral part of the facilities for marketing of the goods Therefore in view of section of the Amending Act which provided for the validation of the levy of market fee and which provided further by section and that no proceedings for refund would lie there cannot be any order of refund in the instant case A In the instant case the High <ORG> having found that basically and essentially the fee was justified on the theory of quid pro quo the <ORG> was entitled to give positive directions regards the manner the money should be spent In facts and circumstances of the case <ORG> should have held that there is no correlation and that there is no justification for enhancement of the rate of the market fee The learned judges of <ORG> have failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in them by law by not recording any finding one way or the other on the question of correlation and that they have clothed <ORG> and the Chief Marketing Officer with their jurisdiction to decide the question whether the enhancement is justified and if not justified to effect a down ward revision wherever necessary i Enhancement of the rate of market fee leviable under of the Act by Amendments of the bye laws from one per cent to two per cent of the price of the notified agricultural produce is invalid in law for non compliance with the law laid down in <NAME> case ii Admittedly there was no previous publication as required by as it stood at the relevant time and that requirement is purported to have been dispensed with retrospectively by of Ordinance of That is why the provision for previous publication was made in of the Act as it stood at the relevant time When undisputably there was no such resolution or proposal by <ORG> for enhancement of the rate of the market fee it is difficult to see how the direction of the Chief Marketing Officer given to <ORG> to amend the bye laws for raising the rate of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent can be considered to be his approval Therefore the enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent by amendment of the bye law under the directions of the Chief Marketing Officer without complying with the principles of law laid down in <NAME> case is bad in law The same would be the position even if the amendment to the bye law was made in accordance with of the Act as it stood before the amendment by the Ordinance of <ORG> has thus given an opportunity to the Market Committees to fill up the lacuna since the materials supplied thereafter by way of Ex In these circumstances no order for refund of the market fee collected under the substituted and the excess market fee collected under of the Act could be made in these cases What <NAME> case decided was that in the facts of that case there was no clear nexus between the fee and the services rendered In the instant case though the fee appears to be on the higher side but there is unimpeachable evidence to show that the entire amount realised has not been spent on some other object or purpose but has been kept in reserve for developing the markets during the course of the coming years Though this period is large but it cannot be said that there is no nexus between the fee realised Whether the development takes place immediately or in the course of a few years so long as it is done with in a reasonable period it cannot be said that the fee amounts to a tax and is therefore ultra vires Thus it is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule which ld apply for all times to come I therefore with due respect agree with the observations made and the detailed survey done by Brother <NAME> This disposes of the first limb of the question of levy of fee so far as the agricultural produce in Karnataka State is concerned Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Difficulty arises in borderline cases where an industry has been declared by the <ORG> under entry of List I and this entry overlaps to a great extent the corresponding entry in List II It is hereby declared that it is expendent in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the tobacco industry Where Virginia tobacco is sold at any auction platform established by the <ORG> under this Act A it shall be competent for the <ORG> or for any officer of the <ORG> authorised by it in this behalf to levy fees for the services rendered by the <ORG> in relation to such sale at such rate not exceeding two per cent of the value of such tobacco as the Central Government may from time to time by notification in the Official Gazette specify The Central Government may by order published in the Official Gazette make provision for prohibiting restricting or otherwise controlling the import or export of tobacco products either generally or in specified classes of cases All tobacco and tobacco products to which any order under sub section applies shall be deemed to be goods of which the import or export has been prohibited under section of the Customs Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly Though some Markets are situated in Karnataka State but that to my kind makes no difference because the Central legislation applies to the whole country When the <ORG> took over the tobacco industry without any preconditions or permutations and combinations and established <ORG> for regulating the sale and purchase of tobacco under entry of List I the entire field of tobacco industry was fully occupied and nothing remained for the States to do and thus neither the doctrine of entrenchment nor that of pith and substance would have any application Section of the Act deals with registration of Exporters packers auctioneers and dealers of tobacco and may be reproduced thus No registered grower or curer shall sell or cause to be sold virginia tobacco elsewhere than at an auction platform registered with the <ORG> in accordance with rules made under this Act or established by the <ORG> under this Act It is manifest therefore that by virtue of the aforesaid steps taken by the central legislation the field of tobacco stood completely occupied and there was no room for application of the doctrine of pith and substance nor would the question of the incidental entrenchment arise in such cases Extent of laws made by <ORG> and by the Legislatures of State Subject to the provisions of this Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the State Subject matter of laws made by <ORG> and by the Legislatures of States Notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List Subject to clauses and the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the State List Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State not with standing that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List It may be pointed out at the very outset that the A function of the Lists is not to confer powers The entries in the three Lists are only legislative heads or fields or legislation and the power to legislate is given to appropriate legislature by Articles and sic of the Constitution it is also well settled that where two Acts one passed by the <ORG> and the other by a State legislature collide and there is no question of harmonising them then the Central legislation must prevail In A Lord Haldane after stating the rule of exception applicable to the heads of ss and added Neither the Parliament of Canada nor <ORG> have authority under the Act to nullify by implication any more then expressly statutes which they could not enact While <ORG> is given power it is expressly provided that <ORG> has not power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I On a very strict interpretation of it would necessarily follow that from all matters in A The section would then mean that <ORG> has full and exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List I and has also power to legis late with respect to matters in List III <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to List II minus matters falling in List I or List III has concurrent power to legislate with respect to matters in List III minus matters falling in List I In its fullest scope would then mean that if it happens that there is any subject in List II which also falls in List I or List III it must be taken as cut out from List II Repugnancy between two statutes may thus be ascertained on the bases of the following three principles Whether there is direct conflict between the two provisions Whether <ORG> intended to lay down an exhaustive code in respect of the subject matter replacing the Act of <ORG> and Whether the law made by <ORG> and the law made by <ORG> occupy the same field In this connection this Court observed thus Repugnancy arises when two enanctments both within the competence of the two <ORG>s collide and when the Constitution expressly or by necessary implication provides that the enanctment of one <ORG> has superiority over the other then to the extent of the repugnancy the one supersedes the other The best of two legislation containing contradictory provisions is not however the only criterion of repugnancy for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole filed the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance that is made more emphatic by providing A in cl that the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule but subject to cls Exclusive power of the State <ORG> has therefore to be exercised subject to cl i the exclusive power which the <ORG> has in respect of the matters enumerated in List I Assuming that there is a conflict between entry List I and entry List II which is not capable of reconciliation the power of <ORG> to legislate in respect of a matter which is exclusively entrusted to it must supersede pro tanto the exercise of power of <ORG> Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that filed is abstracted from the legislative competence Or the <ORG> Legislature This proposition is also self evident that no attempt was rightly made to contradict it This takes us no where because in the first place as the assent of the President was not taken the Karnataka Act of was wholly incompetent Moreover even if the President assent would have been taken it would not validate the Karnataka Act of so far as the Tobacco Industry is concerned because Article applies only to matters contained in the Concurrent List and has nothing to do with matters enumerated in List I or List II On a careful consideration therefore of the facts and circumstances of this case I express my respectful dissent with the view taken by Brother <NAME> on this point and hold that so far as the case of the I A No of is concerned the Government of Karnataka had no jurisdiction to levy any market fee because that directly collides with the Act as indicated above This being the position therefore strike down that part of the Karnataka Act which takes in itself the power to levy market fee on tobacco or its products Even if the products may be sold in the markets in Karnataka or near about the same place situated in the State the power to levy fees will not belong to that State it will remain with <ORG> which would regulate the sale and purchase of tobacco This indirectly shows that <ORG> was aware that it could not encroach on the field which was fully occupied by tho <ORG> by virtue of the Act Having regard to these circumstances I allow the appeal of the I A No of and quesh the order of <ORG> levying fee on tobacco and its products Pursuant to the market fee appears to have been fixed by all the market committees in the State of Karnataka at thirty paise per one hundred rupees of the price paid to the buyers The enhancement of the market fee from thirty paise to one rupee per one hundred rupees of the price paid to buyers was upheld by <ORG> in the decision rendered on in No of <NAME> <ORG> Sagar which deals with the powers and duties of market Committees was amended with retrospective effect from so as to substitute in clause ii of sub section of the words transport and marketing for the word marketing In Sub section a of with reference to the duties of the Marketing Committees after item the amendment stated provide either independently or along with some other authority necessary facilities for the transport of notified agricultural produce to the yard in such manner as may be prescribed Not withstanding anything contained in any decree order or judgment of any court or other authority any levy or collection of market fee made or purported to have been made any action taken or thing done in relation to such levy or collection under the provisions of the principal Act before the commencement of this section shall be deemed to be as valid and effective as if such levy or collection or action or thing had been made taken or done under the principal Act as amended by this Act and accordingly a all acts proceedings or things done or action taken by any market committee in connection with the levy and collection of such market fee shall for all purposes be deemed to be or to have always been made done or taken in accordance with law no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any court or before any authority for the refund to any such market fee and no court shall enforce any decree or order directing the refund of any such fee Notwithstanding such repeal any action taken or any appointment notification order scheme rule form or bye law made or issued from deemed to have been taken made or issued under the Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing Regulation Amendment Ordinance shall be deemed to have been taken made or issued under this Act as if this Act were in force at all relevant times and any reference therein to the said Ordinance shall be deemed to be a reference to this Act and they A shall continue in force accordingly unless and until superseded by any action taken or any appointment notification order scheme rule form or bye law made or issued under this Act or any other law As regards relating to market fees on buyers <ORG> rejected the contention that the sub section confers uncanalised and excessive power on market committees in the matter of fixing the rate of market fees and held that there are adequate statutory guidelines and safeguards The learned counsel for the petitioners invited the attention of <ORG> to the following passage occurring at page of volume of Halsbury Laws of England Third Edition The bye law to be valid must be reasonable Unless it is manifestly unjust capricious or partial in the operation or involves oppressive gratuitous inferences with the rights of those subject to it the question of its reasonableness is one to be decided by the authority making it It was contended before <ORG> that the very process by which the amendment to the bye law for enhancing the market fee from one per cent to two per cent was made is without any application of the mind of the market committees to the relevant criteria and it should therefore be struck down on that ground It was contended that the amendment of providing for enhancement of the maximum permissible limit of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent became effective from and that <ORG> lost no time in mechanically raising the market fee from one per cent to two per cent without any application of the mind to the question whether such enhancement was justified having regard to the financial resources available and the funds required to meet the outlay on the services proposed to be provided in the near future and without preparing any budget estimates and balance sheet and considering them before deciding upon the quantum of enhancement and without giving an opportunity of being heard about the matter to the affected interests It was submitted before <ORG> that there was no compliance with the requirement of previous sanction add previous publication in the prescribed manner in regard to the amendment of the bye law for enhancing the rate of market fee leviable under from one per cent to two per cent <ORG> has observed that there was no answer to that criticism in regard to the validity of the amendment to the bye law for raising the market fee from one per cent to two per cent and therefore the State Government promulgated Ordinance of when arguments before <ORG> were coming to a close amending as also ss and of the act <ORG> has observed that this amendment took away the obligation of prior hearing of the affected interests on the ground that the persons affected have no right to be heard before statutory rules or bye laws are made unless the right is conferred by the Statute and that the right has been taken away by ss and of the amending Ordinance of Even the learned Advocate General appearing for the <ORG> and the learned Counsel appearing for the market Committees stated before <ORG> though according to them no obligation of hearing the affected interests was implicit in that it would be eminently desirable that <ORG> adopt some reasonable procedure in that behalf and that the amendment to made by the Ordinance was only intended to cure the defect in making the impugned bye laws and avoid great public inconvenience which may result from the invalidation of the bye laws and that there was no intention to make the deletion a permanent feature They submitted that any reasonable procedure which may be suggested by <ORG> would be adopted in practice even if there was no such legal compulsion Point No framed in para of the judgment of <ORG> relates to the question of justification for enhancement of the market fee payable under of the Act from one per cent to two per cent and roads thus Whether the enhancement of market fees leviable under of the Act from one per cent to two per cent brought about by amendment of the bye laws of <ORG> in unsupportable in law and fails for want of correlation with the value of services rendered to the payers of the fees As learned counsel wanted A the Court to examine these proposals also having regard to the principles and guide lines laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra we directed by over order dated the Chief Marketing Officer to furnish in respect of each respondent <ORG> a comprehensive statement in a tabular from setting out the following amongst other particulars But in some cases before us even where there are similarities in the nature of the produce and in other circumstances the ambitions for development are irreconcilably disparate But apart from such basic infrastructures which stand on a different footing the benefit of utilitarian projects relatable to and developed from fee resources must be available to the payers of the fee for at least a considerable part of the period covered by the financial estimates and projections Indeed having regard to the wide range of the apparently inexplicable disproportions in the developmental projects of the various Market Committees both the learned Advocate General and the Learned counsel for the Market Committees stated that there was obvious scope in our opinion an imperative need for some rationalisation of the pattern of development of market yards based upon and related to the relevant factors such as quantum and nature of agricultural produced handled by the markets potentialities of development of the market in reasonably near future and the like A time bound schedule has to be prescribed for the Chief Marketing Officer as the authority under the Act approving the budgets to evolve and standardise broad and general norms taking into account the observations made in the course of this order both for infra structural and developmental works and services on as uniform a basis as may reasonably be feasible for the various markets depending upon their classification to be made by the on the basis of such criteria as he A may deem relevant and also to evolve corresponding cost patterns of the projects with suitable unbuilt indicia for escalation of cost structures from time to time proportional to the rise in the price of material The <ORG> will again scrutinise these revised proposals and their cost projections and if upon such scrutiny is of opinion that the present market fee of any Market <ORG> in the category and supra is unjustified the <ORG> will make appropriate orders under of the Act directing the Market <ORG> or <ORG>s concerned to amend their bye laws to effect an appropriate downward revision in the quantum of the fee Wherever the <ORG> is of the opinion after A an examination of the proposals that there is no need to make a downward revision he shall make a specific note in the behalf of the Act from one per cent to two per cent brought about by the amendment of the bye laws of <ORG> is unsupportable in law and fails for want of correlation with the value of services rendered to the payers of the fee Para extracted above consists only of the direction given by the learned Judges of <ORG> to the Chief Marketing Officer Proceeding on the basis that the Tobacco Board Act is in relation only to Virginia tobacco and not all varieties of tobacco <ORG> has observed that any intention of <ORG> meaning <ORG> to cover the whole field and make a comprehensive law in regard to marketing of tobacco is not manifest in the Central enactment and that the two legislations can co exist and operate cumulatively I have set out above the gist of <ORG> decisions on the points regarding which alone arguments were advanced before this Court in the Writ Petitions Civil Appeals and Special Leave Petitions under but not the provisions of the Tobacco Board Act and That a writ of mandamus be issued to direct <ORG> and <ORG> to refund to the Writ petitioners who had approached <ORG> and had the benefit of the issuance of writs of mandamus for the refund of the sellers market fees actually paid under in cases where the mandamus issued had not been complied with by the respondents in the writ petitioners in view of the validating provision contained in of the Amendment Act of on such writ petitioners filing their claims in writing before <ORG> concerned and in the second category of cases where the writ petitioners had not approached <ORG> earlier their claims for refund of the market fee paid by them as sellers shall be confined to the market fees paid under within a period of years immediately preceding the presentation of the writ petitions and the same procedure as in the case of the other class of writ petitioners shall be followed Mr <NAME> appearing for most of the appellants and the petitioners in the writ petitions and special leave petitions namely traders advanced arguments on all the above points Mr <NAME> appearing for the appellants in Civil Appeals Nos to of adopted the arguments of Mr <NAME> and supplemented it with his own The reduction of the enhanced levy from two per cent to one per cent by the Circular No SMD RGN dated issued pursuant to <ORG> decision shows that the State Government and <ORG> prefer this course to the exercise suggested by <ORG> to be completed within eight moths of the judgment and that there was no justification for the enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent by amendment of the bye law relating to the levy of market fee under of the Act The amendment of the bye laws was not in accordance with the procedure laid down by of the Act for making bye laws and amendments thereto for want of previous approval of the Chief Marketing Officer and previous publication of the proposed amendment and hearing of the affect interests and ss a and of Ordinance of promulgated when the hearing of the Writ Petitions in <ORG> was in progress would not cure the defect In the course of the arguments before <ORG> it was specifically conceded that there was no compliance with the requirement of in making the amendment of the bye law for enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent a all acts proceedings or things done or action taken by the State Government or by the Market Committees or by any other authority in connection with the levy Of collection of market fec shall for all purposes be deemed to be and to have always been done or taken in accordance with law and stated that no suit or other proceedings shall be instituted maintained or continued in any court or before any authority for refund of any such market fee or for questioning the validity of any action or thing taken or done under the said bye laws and no court shall recognise or enforce any decree or order declaring the said bye laws or any action or thing taken or done thereunder as invalid on the ground that the bye laws were made with out giving reasonable opportunity to persons likely to be affected thereby to file their objections and suggestions or otherwise without following the procedure prescribed <ORG> has practically held so as can be seen from the direction given by it in para of the judgment as to what should be done before a market committee amends its bye law to make an upward revision of the rate of market fee in the light of the submission made by the learned Advocate General appearing for the <ORG> and the learned Counsel appearing for the Market Committees that it will be eminently desirable that the Market Committees should adopt some reasonable procedure in that behalf and that the amendment of of the Act made by Ordinance of was only intended to cure the defect in the making of the impugned amendment of the bye law to avoid great public inconvenience which will result from the invalidation of the bye law and that there was no intention to make the deletion a permanent feature and any reasonable procedure which may be suggested by <ORG> would be adopted in practice even if there was no such legal compulsion to and other statements referred to in <ORG> judgment were prepared long after the date of filing of the Writ Petitions in <ORG> and only pursuant to the directions given by <ORG> for that purpose on <ORG> was not satisfied even with those estimates projections and statements and has therefore issued the directions contained in paras and of the judgment and those directions have been given in respect of all the Market Committees and not in respect of only or Market Committees in categories and as contended by Mr <NAME> Enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent is not justified <ORG> erred in holding that the Tobacco Board Act covers only Virginia tobacco and is not repugnant to the provisions of the Act ignoring the provisions of ss a and of the Tobacco Board Act and of the Rules made under the provisions of that Act Though reference is made in a to of that Act to Virginia tobacco clause relates to promoting the gradation of tobacco at the level of growers clause relates to sponsoring assisting co ordinating or encouraging scientific technological and economic research for the promotion of tobacco industry and says that without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subjection and subject to priority being given to matters specified in sub section the measures referred to in sub section may also provide in relation to tobacco other than Virginia tobacco for all or any of the matters specified in clauses to of sub section and for this purpose any reference in those clauses to Virginia tobacco shall be construed as including a reference to tobacco other than Virginia tobacco Clauses to of read thus maintenance and improvement of existing markets and development of new markets outside India for Indian Virginia tobacco and its products and devising of marketing strategy in consonance with demand for the commodity outside India including group marketing under limited brand names cc establishment by the <ORG> of auction plat forms with the previous approval of <ORG> for the sale of Virginia tobacco by registered growers or curers and functioning of the <ORG> as an auctioneer at auction platforms established by or registered with it subject to such conditions as may be specified by <ORG> recommending to Central Government the minimum prices which may be fixed far purposes of Virginia tobacco with a view to avoiding unhealthy competition amongst the exporters regulating in other respects Virginia tobacco marketing in India and export of virginia tobacco having due regard to the interests of growers manufacturers and the nation propagating information useful to the growers dealers and exporters including packers of Virginia tobacco and manufacturers of Virginia tobacco products and others concerned with Virginia tobacco and products thereof and purchasing Virginia tobacco from growers when the same is considered necessary or expedient for protecting the interests of the growers and disposal of the same in India or abroad as and when considered appropriate These clauses to would apply to tobacco also in view of of the Tobacco Board Act Mr <NAME> adopted the arguments of Mr <NAME> and supplemented it with his own to and other statements prepared and produced by the Market Committees pursuant to <ORG> directions issued on having regard to the fact that subsection of under which that amount had to be credited to <ORG> has been struck down in <NAME> case supra and that sub section has been omitted from the Act as if it never existed in it Clear quid pro quo was established in respect of Market Committees falling in categories A and for enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent and no further enquiry was needed on the principles laid down in <NAME> case supra <ORG> found that reconsideration of the financial projections by the Market Committees was necessary only in regard to out of the remaining Market Committees and it was entitled to give the directions which had been given to the Chief Marketing Officer to re examine them There is no repugnancy between the Act and the Tobacco Board Act Mr <NAME> submitted that after has been omitted from the Act as if it never existed in it there was no question of striking down as substituted by the Amendment Art of that of that Amendment Act has validated the levy and there is no A question of the refund of the market fee collected under as the fee collected under the Act has to be used for the purposes envisaged by the Act and than in any event the refund could be only to the Market Committees and not to the traders This decision indicates what should be borne in mind when there is a complaint that the market fee already levied is A excessive or before any further increase in the levy is made But the laudable end in itself cannot justify the means to achieve that end if the means have got no sanction of the law From a conspectus of the various authorities of this Court we deduce the following principles for satisfying the tests for a valid levy of market fees on the agricultural produce bought or sold by licensees in a notified market area That the amount of fee realised must be earmarked for rendering services to the licensees in the notified market area and a good and substantial portion of it must be shown to be expended for this purpose That the services rendered to the licensees must be in relation to the transaction of purchase or sale of the agricultural produce How then <ORG> can be made to contribute a very big chunk of their market fee income in the construction of link roads through all villages To put the matter logically if a link road is to be constructed from a village to the main road for enabling an agriculturist to trans port his produce up the main road then <ORG> should be under an obligation to construct or at least to maintain the main road also in order to enable that agriculturist to reach the market which may be at a distance of miles from the link road The impost must be correlated with the service to be rendered to the payers of the fees in the sense and to the extent we have pointed out above where Sen <NAME> speaking for the Bench has observed at page thus It has to be noticed that the observation was made by the learned Judge in a case in which the appellants who were manufacturers of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Kerala Abkari Act Coming now to fees a fee is generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some Governmental agency If as we hold a fee is regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered it is absolutely necessary that the levy of fees should on the face of the legislative provision be correlated to the expenses incurred by <ORG> in rendering the services Compulsion lies in the fact that payment is enforceable by law against a person in spite of his unwillingness or want of consent A levy in the nature of a fee does not cease to be of that character merely because there is an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it nor is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual service rendered by the authority to each individual who obtains the benefit of service With respect it is not possible to agree with the above observation that there is no generic difference between a tax and a fee and the element of quid pro quo in the stricto senso is not always a sine qua non for a fee in view of my learned brother <NAME> approval in <ORG> case supra of the i distinction pointed out by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> supra between a tax and fee and that it is A absolutely necessary that levy of fee should on the face of the legislative provisions be correlated to the expenses incurred in rendering services and the learned Judge observation in that decision that the same view was reiterated by this Court in <NAME> case supra <NAME> case supra and also in view of the decision of the larger Bench of five Judges of this Court in <NAME> case supra that quid pro quo is a necessary element of the market fee In <NAME> case supra while the construction of link roads has been welcomed by the learned Judges it has been observed Uplift of villages and helping the agriculturists by all means is the duty and the obligation of the <ORG> no doubt and it has to do it by incurring expenses out of the public exchequer consisting of the income from various kinds of taxes etc <NAME> in Sreenivasa General Traders case supra <NAME> <NAME> has observed in his judgment thus He also draw attention to the increasing realisation that the element of quid pro quo in the strict sense was not always a sine que non for fee He further pointed out that an insistence upon a good and substantial portion of an amount collected on account of fee say in the neighbourhood of two thirds or three fourths being shown with reasonable certainty as having been spent for rendering services in the market to the payer of the fee could not be a rule of universal application and that it was a rule which had necessarily to be confined to the special facts of <NAME> case supra We agree with the view of Sen <NAME> that the observations extracted by him from <NAME>s case were not really necessary for that case and we also agree with the clarification of the observation made by Sen <NAME> With respect I am not able to see how an why the observations made in <NAME> case supra have to be confined to the special facts of that case That is what has happened in these cases arising under the Act which relates to Karnataka State Therefore with respect I an unable to see how and why what as been decided in <NAME> case supra should he confined to the facts of that case alone It may be noticed that even the High Court has given similar directions to <ORG>s and the Chief Marketing Officer to see whether there is justification for increasing the market fee from one per cent to two per cent on the invitation of the learned Advocate General appearing for the <ORG> and the learned Consel appearing for <ORG> as stated above The principles of law laid down by the Bench of five learned Judges of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra so long as they have not been dissented from varied or set aside by a larger Bench are binding with respect not only on smaller Benches of this <ORG> but also undoubtedly on <ORG>s and other <ORG> and parties similarly placed I have already pointed out that the facts and the points which arose for consideration in <NAME> case supra <ORG> case supra and the present cases are broadly similar I have set out the seven points laid down by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra in the earlier part of my judgment and four of those points which have a direct bearing on these cases in the preceding paras Therefore with respect <ORG> erred in law in not applying the principle of law laid down by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and failing to strike down the enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent on account of the failure to comply with the principles laid down in <NAME> case supra Even the learned Advocate General appearing for the <ORG> and the learned Counsel appearing for <ORG> had stated before the learned Judges of <ORG> that it would be eminently desirable that <ORG> should adopt some reasonable procedure in that behalf and that the amendment to of the Act made by Ordinance of dispensing with the need for prior publication and hearing of the affected interests was only intended to cure the defect in making the impugned amendment to the bye law for avoiding great public inconvenience which may result from the invalidation of the bye law and there was no intention to make the deletion brought about by the Ordinance a permanent feature They submitted before the learned Judges of <ORG> that any reasonable procedure which may be suggested by them would be adopted in future even if there is no such legal compulsion In these circumstances <ORG> has observed It appears to us that before <ORG> propose to amend a bye law to make an upward revision of the rate of fee in future <ORG> must first follow the directions of the Supreme <ORG> given in para in <NAME> case The learned Judges have thereafter given the directions contained in the judgment in that case as mentioned above With respect I am unable to see how the directions given by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra should be followed only in future and how there is no compulsion in law for <ORG> to follow the directions already given by this <ORG> in that case and how this could be dispensed with or ignored for the purpose of the impugned enhancement The same would be the position even if the amendment to the bye law made in accordance with of the Act as it is stood before the amendment by the Ordinance of Point No in para of <ORG> judgment relating to the question of enhancement of the market fee reads thus Whether the enhancement of market fee leviable under of the Act from one per cent to two per A cent brought about by the amendment of the bye law responnents Market Committees is unsupportable in law and fails for want of correlation with the value of services rendered to the payers of the fee The appellant are bound to succeed in the light of the decision in <NAME> case supra if they prove that the enhancement of the market fee was made without complying with the law laid down in that case <ORG> has thus given an opportunity to the Market Committees to fill up the lacuna since the materials supplied thereafter by way of Exs Indeed having regard to the wide range of the apparently inexplicable disproportions in the developmental projects of the various Market Committees both the learned Advocate General and the learned Counsel for the Market Committees stated that there was obvious scope in our opinion an imperative need for some rationalisation of the pattern of development of market yards based upon and related to the relevant factors such as quantum and nature of agricultural produce handled by the markets potentialities of development of the market in the reason ably near future and the like A time bound schedule has to be prescribed for the Chief Marketing Officer as the authority under the Act approving the budgets to evolve and standardise broad and general norms taking into account the observations made in the course of this order both for infra structural and developmental works and services on as uniform a basis as may reasonably be feasible for the various markets depending upon their classification to be made by the On the basis of such criteria he may deem relevant and also to evolve corresponding cost patterns of the projects with suitable inbuilt indicia for escalation of cost structures from time to time proportional to the rise in the price of material Wherever the is of the opinion after an examination of the proposals that there is no need to make a downward revision he shall make a specific note in the behalf Then the Chief Marketing officer will again scrutinise these revised proposals and their cost projections and if upon such a scrutiny he is of the opinion that the present two per cent of market fee of any Market Committee in categories and is unjustified he will make the appropriate orders directing <ORG>s concerned to amend their bye laws to effect an appropriate downward revision in the quantum of the fee and wherever he is of the opinion after examination of the proposals that there is no need to make a downward revision he shall make a specific not in this behalf and he shall make these orders within a period of eight months from the date of the judgment This confusion was perhaps responsible for Mr <NAME> contending seriously in the course of his arguments that the directions given by <ORG> relate to only or of <ORG>s falling in categories and It is not possible to accept this argument for the reason that <ORG> has not recorded any finding on Point No to the effect that there is sufficient correlation in respect of all <ORG>s except or of the market Committees falling in categories and As stated earlier a perusal of paras to and first sentence in para especially para would show that the direction has been given by the learned Judges in respect of all <ORG>s which had enhanced the fee from one per cent to two per cent The learned Judges of <ORG> have observed in para their judgment that having regard to the infirmities noticed in the estimates and financial projections of the proposed developmental works on the basis of which the enhancement is sought to be justified they are unable to say with any confidence and without reservations that the enhancement of the fee depending as it does on these estimates is totally justified and that some time bound directions to which they would refer for having a second look at the estimates of the statutory authorities are required to be issued There is nothing in these observations of <ORG> to indicate that they are confined to only or of the market Committees falling in categories and With respect I think that there is some confusion in this part of the judgment of <ORG> which has given room for argument of Mr <NAME> that the directions have been given only in repect of or of <ORG>s falling in categories and I therefore agree with Mr <NAME> that the directions given in paras to and the first sentence in para of the impugned judgment relate to all <ORG>s which had enhanced the market fee from one per cent to two per cent and not to only or of <ORG>s falling in categories and and that in view of the observation made in para that having regard to the infirmities noticed in the estimates and financial projections of the proposed development works on the basis of which alone the enhancement is sought to be justified they are unable to say with any confidence and without reservations that the enhancement of the fee is totally justified they should have held that there is no conelation and that there is no justification for the enhancement of rate of the market fee For these reasons I hold that there is no correlation and that there is no justification for the enhancement of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent I am constrained to observe that the learned judges of <ORG> have failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in them by law by not recording any finding on Point No one way or the other namely that there is or no correlation and that they have clothed <ORG>s and the Chief Marketing Officer with their jurisdiction to decide the question whether the enhancement is justified and if not justified to effect a downward revision wherever necessary According to of the Act as it stood on the date of the amendment of the bye laws for enhancing the rate of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent and on the dates on which the Writ Petitions were filed in <ORG> subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder under and with the previous sanction of the Chief Marketing Officer a market committee may after previous publication in the prescribed manner make bye law for regulation of the business and the conditions of trading in the market area It was contended before <ORG> that there is no compliance with the requirement of previous sanction and previous publication in the prescribed manner in regard to the amendment of the bye laws for raising the market fee leviable under of the Act from one per cent to two per cent Validation Nothwithstanding anything contained in any judgment decree or order of any court or other authority any bye law made or purporting to have been made and levy or collection of market fee made and any action or thing taken or done in relation to such levy or collection under the provisions of the principal Act before the commencement of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be as valid and effective as if such bye law or levy or collection or action or thing had been made taken or done under the principal Act as amended by section and of this Ordinance and accordingly a all acts proceedings or things done or action taken by <ORG> or by <ORG> or by any other officer of <ORG> or of <ORG> or by any other authority in connection with the levy or collection of the market fee shall for all purposes be deemed to be and to have always been done or taken in accordance with law and no suit or other proceedings shall be instituted maintained or continued in any Court or before any authority for refund of any such market fee or for questioning the validity of any action or thing taken or done under the said bye laws and no court shall recognise or enforce any decree or order declaring the said bye laws or any action or thing taken or done thereunder as invalid on the ground that the bye laws were made without giving reasonable opportunity to persons likely to be affected thereby to file their objections and suggestions or otherwise without following the procedure prescribed Previous publication referred to in as it originally stood before the amendment to the bye la vs for enhancing the rate validates the amendment to the bye laws made without such previous publication without giving an opportunity to the affected interests of being heard in the matter When undisputably there was no such resolution or proposal by <ORG> for enhancement of the rate of the market fee I am unable to see how the direction of the Chief Marketing Officer given to <ORG> to amend the bye laws for raising the rate of the market fee from one per cent to two per cent can be considered to be his approval Admittedly there was no previous publication as required by as it stood at the relevant time and that requirement is purported to have been dispensed with retrospectively by of Ordiance of It is seen from the impugned judgment that it was submitted before the learned Judges of <ORG> that the affected interests right of being heard was conferred by the Statute and it has been taken away by the subsequent amendment to the Statute with retrospective effect and that there is That is why the provision for previous publication was made in of the Act as it stood at the relevant time It is not possible to accept the contention that the right given by law was taken away by law and cannot therefore be claimed by the affected interests for though it was mentioned in of the Act as it stood at the relevant time it was a right A which was available to the affected interests under the principles of natural justice of being heard before the enhancement could be made <ORG> appears to have been aware of this position and to have not been quite happy about how the enhancement of the market fee has been brought about for the learned Judges have observed in para of their judgment that the question might become a live issue if <ORG> were to amend the bye laws in future without giving an opportunity of being heard to the affected interests Even the learned Advocate General appearing for the <ORG> and the learned Counsel appearing for <ORG> had stated before the learned Judges of <ORG> that the amendment to made by the Ordinance was only intended to cure the defect in making the impugned bye laws to avoid great public inconvenience and that there was no intention to make the deletion of the requirement of previous publication a permanent feature Notwithstanding anything contained in any decree order of judgment of any court or other authority any levy or collection of market fee made or purported to have been made any action taken or thing done in relation to such levy or collection under the provisions of the principal Act before the commencement A of this section shall be deemed to be as valid and effective as if such levy or collection or action or thing had been made taken or done under the principal Act as amended by this Act and accordingly a all acts proceedings or things done or action taken by any market committee in connection with the levy and collection of such market fee shall for all purposes be deemed to be or to have always been made done or taken in accordance with law no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any court or before any authority for the refund of any such market fee and no court shall enforce any decree or order directing the refund of any such fee The market fee levied on and collected from sellers under the substituted of the Act went to the credit of <ORG> under sub section In the Act there is no provision in regard to the market fee like A of the Punjab Agricultral Produce Markets Act sub section thereof reads thus Notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment decree or order of any court it shall be lawful for a market committee to retain the fee levied and collected by it from a licensee in excess of that leviable under if the burden of such fee was passed on by the licensee to the next purchaser of the agricultural produce in respect whereof such fee was levied and collected In these circumstances I do not think that any order for refund of the market fee collected under the substituted and the excess market fee collected under of the Act could be made in these cases To summarise my findings are of the Act as substituted by Amendment Act of and Act of and of Amendment Act of in so for as it seeks to save that has been done under of the Act are unconstitutional and have been rightly struck down by <ORG> Enhancement of the rate of market fee leviable under of the Act by amendments of the bye laws from one per cent to two percent of the price of the notified agricultural produce is invalid in law for non compliance with the law laid down in <NAME> case supra There is no correlation between the enhancement of the rate of the market fee leviable under from one per cent to two per cent and the services rendered or proposed to be rendered by <ORG> and therefore the enhancement is invalid in law Amendment of the bye laws made for enhancement of the rate the market fee leviable under of the Act from one per cent to two per cent is invalid in law The provisions of the Act are repugnant to the Tobacco Board Act and therefore tobacco is liable to be removed from the schedule and There shall be no refund of the market fees collected under the substituted of excesss fee collected under either by <ORG> or by any of <ORG> <NAME> Some Writ petitions out of a large number of petitions nearly in number arising out of The Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing Regulation Act hereinafter referred to as the Act were take up by <ORG> for hearing and disposed of by one common judgment as one or more of the contentions in those petitions were A common and all the petitions were heard together by <ORG> so as to afford opportunities to learned counsel appearing in the cases to address arguments In these appeals we were concerned with the provisions of the Act as well as the challenge to the constitutional validity of section of the Act as substituted by The Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing Regulation Amendment Act hereinafter referred to as the Amending Act which sought to validate the market fee levied on the sellers of notified agricultural produce under section for and during the period of its operation prior to its being struck down by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Anr On st May the Act came into force section was amended by insertion of a proviso to section as under Provided that <ORG> may by order in public interest exempt <ORG> from such levy and collection in respect of any agricultural produce On st June by the Amending Act No of the following changes were made a By section of the amending Act the word MARKETING was substituted for the words buying and selling in the long title to the Act By section of the amending Act the word MARKETING was substituted for the words buying and selling in the preamble to the Act On or about judgment was delivered by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> and Anr By the said judgment <ORG> struck down section and of the Act which authorised the levy and collection of market fee on the sellers of agricultural produce and <ORG> in the said judgment also considered the levy of market fee at the rate of per cent on the buyers of the agricultural produce levied and collected by certain Market Committees and upheld such levy on the buyers of agricultural produce following the earlier judgment dated th December in <NAME> case mentioned hereinbefore On or about the th June Ordinance No was promulgated which brought about the following changes a Section of the Act which deals with powers and duties of <ORG>s was amended with retrospective effect from so as to provide that in clause ii of sub section of section the words Transport and Marketing shall be substituted for the word Marketing in the said clause iii Sub section of section of the Act providing for the levy of Market fee on the buyers of the agricultural produce was amended by enhancing the maximum permissible levy there to from per cent to per cent One of the questions posed was whether section of the Act as substituted by the Amending Act of read with section of the said Amending Act retrospectively validating the levy and collection of market fees on the sellers at one per cent for the period between and was constitutionally valid It was contended on behalf of the petitioners before <ORG> that section as substituted by Act of read with section of the Amending Act seeking to validate the collection of market fee on sellers made under the old section was constitutionally invalid It must be kept in view that this validation had become necessary in view of the judgment of this Court in <NAME> case supra striking down sub sections and of section of the Act as these then stood The present substituted section read with section of the Amending Act sought to validate the collections of market fee on sellers made when the earlier section was operative A I After discussing several decisions Karnataka High Court felt that the second major defect noticed in the law in the case of <NAME> case namely the construction of rural roads could not qualify for being reckoned as special service to a class of persons paying the fee had not been cured or removed by the law which sought to validate the levy and in view of these circumstances the Court came to the conclusion that section as substituted by section of the Amending Act of as well as section of the Amending Act was not constitutionally valid and was liable to be struck down As mentioned before several other contentions and submissions were urged before the learned trial Judge but before us the following main submissions were urged There was no quid pro quo between the imposition of fees and the services rendered In so far as the Amending Act of sought to validate the taxes realised following the defects mentioned in <NAME> case valid or not and if not whether the appellants were entitled to refund of any amount Is imposition of market fee on Tobacco valid Is the deletion of the provisions for previous publication in section proper and valid I will however notice the other contentions briefly raised in those writ petitions It may be borne in mind that the Amending Act of for the first time enumerated tobacco for the purpose of the Act On a consideration of the provisions of the Tobacco Board Act and the present Act after discussing various contentions <ORG> held that there was no repugnancy and conflict as between the provisions of Tobacco Board Act and the present Act It should be borne in mind that there was a declaration under section of the Central Act namely Tobacco Board Act pursuant to entry of List I regarding tobacco It was contended that tobacco after the declaration under section of the Tobacco Board Act became part of entry of List I and it was submitted that once the declaration has made any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field or area according to the appellants was excluded from the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legislature Entry of List I reads as follows Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Sub section of section enjoins that the <ORG> shall have powers to co opt members with the <ORG> in accordance with the rules made under this Act or established by the <ORG> under this Act Section deals with the application cancellation fees and other matters relating to registration Section A deals with the power to levy fees for the services rendered by the <ORG> in relation to such sale at such rate not exceeding two per cent of the value of such tobacco as <ORG> may specify Chapter deals with the control by <ORG> of import and export of tobacco and tobacco products There are provisions under section for the issuance of directions by the <ORG> and by section of returns and reports Chapter VI deals with the penalties and offences by the companies Section provides for the power of <ORG> to make rules Section I provides that the Act will come into force on such date as <ORG> may by notification in <ORG> appoint and proviso of sub section empowers that different dates may be appointed for different provisions of the Act and for different States or different parts thereof Under sub section of section I of Tobacco Board Act by Notification dated st May <ORG> appointed st May as the date on which sections and would come into force in the States of Maharashtra West Bengal Gujarat Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh There was some confusion at the stage of the argument as to on what date it has come into force or even if it has not specially come into force in the State of Karnataka by the passing of the Act itself the <ORG> has sufficiently expressed its intention to occupy the field so as to exclude the operation of any activity by the State Our attention has however been drawn to a Notification being Notification No dated st August whereby section of the said Act came into force in the State of Karnataka from st day of September It may be mentioned that this notification as such would be of no assistance to us because this notification came into force subsequent to the writ petitions and after hearing in these matters was concluded In exercise of powers under section of Tobacco <ORG> Act <ORG> was empowered to make rules <ORG> was of the view that any intention of the superior legislature to cover the whole field to make a comprehensive law with regard to marketing of tobacco was not manifest in the legislation <ORG> was of the view that as long as the market committees became such licensees there was no further requirement under the Tobacco <ORG> Act which could be said to render the provisions of the Act regulating marketing of tobacco under the Act repugnant to or irreconcilable It may however be noted that by letters dated th September and rd September appearing at pages and of the Paper Book it was pointed out on behalf of the petitioners before this Court that the market committees had not even upto that date been registered under the Tobacco <ORG> Act in the first letter written to <ORG> it was stated that the market committee could not be given registration because these lacked certain necessary qualifications and was therefore incapable of rendering any service at all Here it may have to be borne in mind that section of the Tobacco <ORG> Act enjoins that no person shall export tobacco or any tobacco products or function as a packer auctioneer of or dealer in tobacco unless he registers himself with the <ORG> in accordance with the rules made under this Act <ORG> took the view that on the limited aspect of marketing provided for Tobacco Board Act it only made provisions in relation to virginia tobacco and not for all varieties of tobacco It was submitted that once a declaration had been made under section pursuant to Entry the <ORG> had exclusive competence to legislate every aspect or activity pertaining to tobacco and the <ORG> would have no competence to legislate on that topic lt was contended that section of the Act gave an uncanalised and excessive power to the market committees in the matter of specifying the rate of fee It was contended that the requirement of hearing of interests affected was not merely a procedural requirement of Section of the Act but an exercise inherent in the exertion of power of delegated legislation The Advocate General stated before <ORG> that A though there was no obligation it would be eminently desirable to consult or ascertain the views of those who would be affected and <ORG> therefore observed that before a market committee proposed to amend a bye law to make an upward revision of rate of fee in future the market committee could follows the directions of this <ORG> in <NAME> case and <ORG> suggested certain means Ultimately <ORG> came to the following conclusions a Section of the Act did not confer an unguided arbitrary power and there was no excessive delegation of legislative power to the market committees and therefore not vitiated on that account The question whether upon a proper construction section must be held to imply an obligation on the part of the market committees to hear affected interested parties before the rate of fee was fixed was left open with certain observations made in that judgment It had been contended before <ORG> that there was discrimination on the ground that there was levy of the same rate of fee on all types of produce The services rendered to the licensees must be in relation to the transactions of purchase or sale of the agricultural Produce But apart from such basic infrastructure which stood on a different footing the benefit of utilitarian projects relatable to and developed from fee resources must be available to the payers of the fee for at least a considerable part of the period covered by the financial estimates and projections <ORG> for the reasons recorded and taking all factors into consideration came to the conclusion that though there was room for criticism on the whole however taking all the relevant factors into consideration it could not be said that the projections were unreasonable I am in agreement with <ORG> that there was limitation on the powers of the <ORG> in a controversy of this nature At the invitation of the Advocate General and the counsel for <ORG> <ORG> was of the opinion that there was obvious scope and imperative need for giving some directions and <ORG> gave certain directions which are contained in paragraphs onwards of the judgment of <ORG> This part of the judgment has come in for criticism because on behalf of the petitioners appellants it was contended that in fact <ORG> had abandoned its obligation to come to a finding whether there was quid pro quo or not when there was a challenge on that point Whether there could or should be refund of any of these amounts to any of the parties Whether <ORG> had come to any definite conclusion in respect of the eight Market Committees mentioned hereinbefore Whether <ORG> had abandoned its A jurisdiction in not coming to a definite conclusion about the required correlation to sustain quid pro quo for the imposition of market fees Whether <ORG> was competent to give directions to the Market Committees in the manner it had done Whether in respect of marketing of tobacco <ORG> was entitled to legislate or whether in view of the fact that there was a declaration under item of List I of the VIIth Schedule or whether <ORG> had no competence to legislate on this point as such the impugned legislation was ultra vires Whether the amendment of section of the Act as mentioned aforesaid whereby the opportunity of previous publication was deleted was valid or not It is necessary now to deal with the contentions that arise in these appeals as enumerated hereinbefore Entry of List II of VII Schedule speaks of fees in respect of the matter enumerated in List It Similarly Entry of List I of VII Schedule speaks of fees in respect of matters mentioned in List this court reiterated that the distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as part of a common burden while a fee is a payment for a special benefit or privilege The <ORG> however noted that while conferring special benefits to the licensees or payers of fees it was permissible to render other services in the market which might be in the general interest of all concerned in respect of transactions that take place in the markets Services rendered to the licenses must be in relation to the transactions of purchase or sale of produce in the market <NAME> in the said decision observed at page of the report as follows What do we learn from these precedents We learn that there is no generic difference between a tax and a fee though broadly a tax is a compulsory exaction as part of a common burden without promise of any special advantages to classes of tax payers whereas a fee is a payment for services rendered benefit provided or privilege conferred The said decision reiterated the distinction between a fee and a tax and observed that a tax was levied as part of a common burden while a fee was for payment of a specific benefit or privilege although the special advantage was secondary to the primary motive of regulation in public interest There must however be a reasonable relationship between a levy of fee and the services rendered to the payers of fees According to this decision <NAME> case did not lay down any legal principle of general applicability Judgment delivered by <NAME> The <ORG> noted that fee was defined as a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by the <ORG> or some other agency like a local authority or statutory corporation The amount of fee levied was supposed to be based on expenses incurred in rendering the services though in many cases the cost was arbitrarily assessed As a fee was regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered it was necessary that levy should be correlated to the expenses incurred in rendering the services The <ORG> dealt with the question of capital expenditure and observed that the expenditure in constructing buildings for locating the head offices and regional offices and the increase in allowances or other amenities to the staff had also to be Civil Appeal Nos and of judgment delivered by included in the cost of services The <ORG> observed that when A there was a surplus it could not immediately be said that the surplus must necessarily go in reduction of the rate of contribution to be levied thereafter This <ORG> was of the view that it was neither expedient nor prudent to lay down any abstract proposition that whenever there was surplus in a particular year or years that surplus must always be taken into consideration and the rate of contribution should be reduced for the next year or subsequent years The present estimates and projections it was submitted on behalf of the appellants were prepared only with a view to supply an artificial quid pro quo for the enhanced levy and were merely show pieces on paper to get over the Supp In the context of the said contentions urged on behalf of the appellants <ORG> had examined the said statements and projections and recorded findings on these in its judgement On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the appellants that there was a total failure on the part of the respondents to discharge the burden for sustaining the enhanced levy of market fee it was urged that <ORG> consequent to its findings referred to above ought to have quashed the bye laws of the market committees in respect of categories and mentioned hereinbefore Having regard to the detailed analysis of the expenditure of the various market committees we agree with the conclusion of <ORG> that it could not be said that the expenditure and appropriation of fee was so disproportionate to the projects actual and projected that it could be said that the levy lost the character of fee <ORG> felt that even if some of the items of expenditure which were specifically challenged and which <ORG> noted were not strictly permissible on the basis of the remaining works there was ground to hold that there was requisite measure of correlation between fees collected and intended to be collected and services rendered and intended to be rendered but <ORG> felt that for proper working of statutory bodies like the market committees general directions about the future expenditure should be given We accept the submissions urged on behalf of the respondents that these directions were within the competence of <ORG> while dealing with the grievances made under Article of the Constitution to ensure that appropriate statutory authorities acted according to law after properly ascertaining the facts and for the purpose of rendering full justice to the parties Therefore <ORG> while finding that there was a correlation between the services rendered and the fees charged with regard to the eight market committees directed the Chief Marketing Officer to make certain enquiries on certain principles of correlation and directed the surplus if found on such enquiry to be appropriately adjusted in the future by way of reductions of fees This has been stated in the affidavit filed by the Chief Marketing Officer in reply to special leave petition It was contended that so long as this surplus remained there was no case for increasing market fee from I percent to percent crore at the end of at the same time the estimate showed the projected expenditure from to would amount to Rs Necessarily point No must also be answered by saying that <ORG> had come in the facts and circumstances of the case to a definite conclusion of this aspect in respect of eight market committees mentioned hereinbefore It was contended on behalf of the appellants that section as substituted by Act of read with section of the Amending Act seeking to validate the collection of market fee on sellers made under the old section of the Act is constitutionally invalid The present substituted section read with section of the Amending Act seeks to validate the collection of market fee on sellers made when the earlier section was operative We have set out the relevant provisions and the background of the challenge to the Act <ORG> noticed the relevant provisions and the principles of law which should govern the power of the legislature to cure any defect in law with retrospective effect and to validate acts done or taken under defective law which were declared invalid by the courts on any around Market could not be reached and people cannot go and come from the market if there are no good rural roads to reach those markets This view has been recently reiterated by this Court after discussing several authorities in the case of <ORG> <NAME> <ORG> The State Punjab <ORG> supra where it was held that it was of fundamental importance that there should be a network of roadways if effective aid was to be given to farmers to transport and market their produce The Act which sought to validate the levy contributed to <ORG> was for the maintenance of rural roads which as I have noticed forms an integral part of the facilities for marketing of the goods For this purpose reliance may be placed on the observations of this Court in the decision in the case of <ORG> The State of Mysore Anr supra and in that view of the matter and in view of section of the Amending Act which provided for the validation of the levy of market fee and which provided further by section that no proceedings for refund would lie in my opinion in so far as <ORG> had directed to refund in certain cases as indicated in the judgment of <ORG>s I am unable to sustain that part of the order and that order is set aside It must be borne in mind that <ORG> has given specific directions for utilisation of the surplus fund in certain matters to the market committees referred to this discussion before and had come to the conclusion A that section did not confer any arbitrary power and there was no excessive delegation of legislative power to the market committees and therefore not vitiated on that account The question whether on a proper construction of section there was any obligation on the part of the marketing committee to hear the parties was left open with certain observations and directions contained in paragraph of the judgment of <ORG> The next contention canvassed before us was whether in view of the Tobacco Board Act hereinafter referred to as the Central Act and the issue of the notification dated st August by which section of the Central Act was made applicable in the State of Karnataka in so far as the Central Act dealt with the marketing of tobacco the State legislature was not competent to pass this enactment Two broad principles should be borne in mind in deciding the controversy of this nature It was submitted that the effect of the declaration under section of the Central Act pursuant to Entry of List I is that the <ORG> has exclusive competence to legislate upon every aspect or activity pertaining to tobacco including marketing thereof and the <ORG> would have no competence to legislate on that topic As mentioned hereinbefore a declaration under Entry of List I of Vllth Schedule has been made in respect Entry of the said list provides Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Therefore there was no warrant for restricting or limiting the width and amplitude of the words tobacco industry and confining it to a particular type or kind of tobacco On the construction of the Central Act read with the rules it appears to us that the said Central Act and the declaration made by section of the said Act covers all kinds of tobaccos The constitutional scheme is that <ORG> has full and exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List I and has also power to legislate with respect to matters in List III <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List II excluding the matters falling in List I or List III and has also concurrent power to legislate with respect to matters falling in List III excluding matters falling in List I The dominant position of <ORG> with regard to matters in List I and List III is established It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the power of <ORG> with respect to matters in List II was made subject to the power of <ORG> to legislate with respect to matters in List I and therefore followed that if any entry in List I and List II appeared to overlap if these appeared partly to cover the same field the field of legislation covered by the entry in List I must be considered to be taken out of the scope of the entry in List Il and reserved to be only dealt with the <ORG> In the present case the Central Act it was urged fell within entry of List I To the extent that Karnataka State Act by amending the Schedule brought tobacco within the provisions of the State Act it was urged that it was beyond the competence of <ORG> and it had encroached upon the Union List But in resolving the rights of component units of federal or quasi federal set up to which category however Indian Constitutional set up belongs no Constitutional pundit has yet been able to say earnest endeavour should be made to avoid a conflict between two competing enteries as to too liberal an interpretation given to both of them might create a clash Therefore it was urged that the competence of <ORG> will regard to marketing of tobacco and levy of market fee thereon under entry read with entry of List lI which is markets and fairs stood pro tanto superseded by the exercise of the <ORG>ary power under entry read with entry of List I at It was urged that in the case of Cit Furthermore on the facts of the case the Court came to the conclusion that the impugned Act did not concern itself at all with the controlling or licensing of sugar industry or with the production or manufacture of sugar or with trade and commerce in sugar and therefore there was no trenching upon the Union List by the impugned State Act Reliance was placed on the observations at pages of the said decision mentioned hereinbefore supra It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that <ORG> lost its competence because the field was occupied by <ORG> in view of the declaration under section of the Central Act It was evident it was urged that the intention to cover the whole field has been expressed by the Central Act and as intended the Central Act is complete and exhaustive Code in respect of tobacco Consequently the enactment of the subsequent State Legislation was overborne on the ground of repugnancy Applying these tests it would be apparent it was submitted by the appellants that the State Act was repugnant to the Central Act It was finally submitted that in any event without prejudice to other submissions that so far as tobacco was concerned no service had in fact been rendered by the market committees nor could they in law be rendered because of legal constraints imposed by the provisions of the Central Act and in particular section and rule of the Tobacco <ORG> Rules For this reason there was complete failure of quid pro quo and therefore there cannot be any charge of fees by enacting State legislation on tobacco A Central law which in its pith and substance falls within any entry in List I would be valid even though it might contain incidental provisions in List II which may contain ancilliary provisions which might touch on an entry of List I incidentally Similarly a State law which in its pith and substance dealt with a matter falling within List I would be invalid and ultra vires the Constitution The concept of repugnancy arises only with regard to laws dealing with subjects covered by the entries falling in List III in respect of which both parliament and <ORG> are competent to legislate a Like entry of List II Gas and Gas Works without any limitation of entry in List II in respect of any legislation which is in substance and true nature deals with markets and fairs read with entry of the said List has complete ascendency and there cannot be any intrusion of that filed by another entry See in this connection the discussion on Union State Relation under the Indian Constitution Setalvad The State Act is not on a subject in List III nor is the Central Act a law relating to any subject in List III In fact A before <ORG> no contention as it appears from the judgment impugned was at all advanced on the question of services to tobacco trade in the markets concerned The Marketing Act is an Act as the preamble states for the better regulating of buying and selling of agricultural produce and establishment and a administration of markets for agricultural produce and whereas it was thought expedient to provide for the better regulation of buying and selling agriculture produce and establishment of markets for agricultural produce and matters connected therewith that the State Act was passed It laid down the functions duties of the market committees and matters incidental thereto Section of the Central Act states that no registered grower or curer shall sell or cause to be sold virginia tobacco elsewhere than at an auction platform registered with the <ORG> in accordance with the rules made under this Act or established by the <ORG> under this Act Tobacco was brought within the marketing Act in and section of the Tobacco <ORG> Act was made applicable in the State of Karnataka only on st August by the notification referred to hereinbefore There is nothing in the Act or in the Rules which indicate that it is inconsistent with or cannot be operated along with the marketing regulations The position is not clear but it is fully manifest that both Acts can operate in their respective fields and there is no repugnancy if both the Acts are considered in the light of their respective true nature and character While it is true that in the spheres very carefully delineated the <ORG> has supremacy over <ORG> Legislatures supremacy in the the sense that in those fields <ORG>ary legislation would hold the field ands not the <ORG> legislation but to denude <ORG> of its power to legislate where the legislation in question in pith and substance i in its true nature and character belongs to the <ORG> field one should be chary to denude the <ORG> of its powers to legislate and mobilise resources because that would be destructive of the spirit and purpose of India being a Union of <ORG>s <ORG>s must have power to raise and mobilise resources in their exclusive fields In so far as <ORG> directed the refund as indicated before the appeals by the <ORG> are allowed to that extent and the orders of <ORG> are set aside
