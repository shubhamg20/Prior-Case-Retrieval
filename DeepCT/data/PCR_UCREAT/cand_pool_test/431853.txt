DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH PUNCHHI VENKATASWAMI ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT Venkataswami This appeal by special leave is directed against the Division <NAME> judgment of <ORG> dated It was found that the licence submitted by the importer <ORG> did not mention that it was an advance import licence nor was it accompanied by Duty Exemption Entitlement Certificate and the bond In the Letter of Credit also there were certain infirmities and when the same was pointed out it was rectified and submitted before The appellant resisted the writ petition by filing a detailed reply to the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition The petitioners no doubt got these things rectified but because no doubt the communication difficulties there was a delay of a day or two We however add that here essentially the challenge was to the right of fixation of price at any capricious time and that was the subject matter of the petition but we are not required to go into it and therefore we do not go into it Otherwise much could be said in favour of the petitioners when they contend that the prices are required to be fixed quarterly The term quarterly would mean every three months and the <ORG> has fixed the price on and had we been required to decide this question we would have in all probability interpreted clause read with clause to mean that the prices are to the fixed for the period of three months and they are to remain operative for theat period but we are not to opinion on that point because the ultimate relief of the petitioners can be granted without deciding the point Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that <ORG> erred in assuming that the appellant was a department of <ORG> forgetting totally that it is a company incorporated under the Companies Act and it is a separate entity notwithstanding the fact that the company is entirely owned by <ORG> In support of this submission he placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in <NAME> <NAME> On facts <NAME> learned counsel for appellant submitted that on the admitted position that the documents namely licence release order after rectification having been furnished only on the importer cannot claim the application of pre revised price on the ground that the mistake if at all was on the part of the office of the joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and therefore it should not be penalised Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the first respondent placing reliance on para of the Scheme announced on submitted that the Letter of Credit having been furnished after rectifying the defects before the importer is entitled to get the supplies at the pre revised rate notwithstanding the defects in the licence release order as the importer was not responsible for the defects Coming to the merits of the case we accept the contention of the learned for the appellant that <ORG> went wrong in holding that <ORG> was a department of <ORG> In the view of the above decisions of this Court we have no hesitation to hold that <ORG> erred in thinking that <ORG> was a department of <ORG> and most of the reasons given in the judgment are based on this wrong premise Bearing the above said facts in mind let us now consider the issue raised before us We have already noticed that there are number of judgments of the <ORG> taking the view that a company though fully owned by <ORG> when incorporated takes its own entity identify and cannot be considered as department of the <ORG> Further it is seen from the records that the importer in this case is not a new entrant to plead ignorance though that may not be an excuse We cannot agree with the contention of Mr <NAME> that mere presentation of an irrevocable Letter of Credit covering the value of requirement of raw materials is sufficient for registering the indent Mr <NAME> placed reliance on the last part of Paragraph to contend that the date of presentation of irrevocable Letter of Credit will be relevant for fixing the price We have seen that <ORG> has not decided but left open the question relating to the right of the appellant to fix the price from the time to time even though that was the main issue raised in the writ petition before <ORG> As we are not in agreement with the view expressed by <ORG> on other issues it is now necessary for <ORG> to consider the issue relating to the right of the appellant to fix the price from time to time In the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment of <ORG> is set aside and the matter is remitted to <ORG> to decide the right of the appellant to fix the price from time to time and also the question of unjust enrichment
