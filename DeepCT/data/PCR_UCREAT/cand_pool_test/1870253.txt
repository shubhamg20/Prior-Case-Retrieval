DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> DAS HIDAYATULLAH CITATION AIR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC ACT Business Profits Tax Limitation for assessment Notice under Business Profits Tax Act issued beyond four years Validity Profits escaping assessment meaning of Excess Profits Tax Act ss Indian Income tax Act II of SS The question was whether in of the Act a limitation corresponding to the limitation contained in must be necessarily read and whether in a case where the profits were not brought to assessment because notice under was not issued in time they must be deemed to have escaped assessment and action could only be taken under within the time specified therein Held per <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> dissenting that the words profits escaping assessment in of the Business Profits Tax Act apply equally to cases where a notice was received by the assessee but resulted in no assessment under assessment or excessive relief and to cases where due to any reason no notice was issued to the assessee and therefore there was no assessment of his income that ss and Of the Act have to be read together and that a notice under cannot be issued against an assessee beyond the period of four years indicated in For the subsequent and re opened assessment there is a limit of four years but for the assessment for the first time there is no limit Appeal from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Income tax Reference No of The appellant is the Commissioner of Income tax and the respondent is a firm carrying on business in Bombay and the question for decision arises under the Business Profits Tax Act Act of hereinafter referred to as the Act On January the lncome tax Officer issued a notice on the respondent under of the Act in respect of the above mentioned chargeable accounting period which was served on the respondent on January Against this order the respondent took an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on the ground that the respondent was not liable to Business Profits Tax because it was beyond the period of four years limitation under of the Act It held that both ss and had to be read together and the mention of four years in was an important indication of the period of limitation in regard to the issue of notice under also and further if profits which escaped assessment as in the present case could only be taxed within four years of the end of the chargeable accounting period because of of the Act then inferentially the escape of assessment must be at sometime anterior to the period mentioned in and as on the facts of the present case the notice had been issued four years after the close of the chargeable accounting period the notice under wag not valid Against this order the appellant has come in appeal to this Court on a certificate of <ORG> It is submitted by the appellant that though ss and may have to be read together they apply to different sets of circumstances applies to a case where the Income tax Officer requires any person whom he believes to be engaged in any business to which the Act applies or to have been so engaged during any chargeable accounting period and calls upon him to furnish a return with respect to such chargeable accounting period and applies to a case where in consequence of definite information possessed by him the Income tax Officer discovers in regard to any chargeable accounting period that the profits of any business have escaped assessment In other words applies to original assessments after the first notice calling upon an assessee to make a return in regard to the profits of any chargeable accounting period and applies where such notice was issued and it either ended in no assessment at all or there was under assessment etc According to the argument of the appellant therefore there is no period of limitation prescribed by the Act for the first notice to furnish a return in regard to any chargeable accounting period but if such notice was given and a return was made and for any reason whatsoever the profits were not assessed or were under assessed etc then comes into operation and notice has to be served within four years of the end of the chargeable accounting period in question The provisions of the Act which arise for consideration are ss and The Income tax Officer may for the purposes of this Act require any person whom he believes to be enaged in any business to which this Act applies or to have been so engaged during any chargeable accounting period or to be otherwise liable to pay business profits tax to furnish within such period not being less than forty five days from the date of the service of the notice as may be specified in the notice a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner setting forth along with such other particulars as may be provided for in the notice with respect to any chargeable accounting period specified in the notice the profits taxable profits of the business or the amount of deficiency if any available for relief under section If in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that profits of any chargeable accounting period chargeable to business profits tax have escaped assessment or have been underassessed or have been the subject of excessive relief he may at any time within four years of the end of the chargeable accounting period in question serve on the person liable to such tax a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under and may proceed to assess or reassess the amount of such profits liable to business profits tax and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply as if the notice were a notice issued under that section These sections lead to the conclusion that every business to which the Act applies is liable to the risk of being assessed to Business Profits Tax and it is well settled that income escapes assessment when the process of assessment has not been initiated as also in a case where it has resulted in no assessment after completion of the process of assessment If the provisions relating to escaping of assessment in the two statutes i in of the former and in of the latter as it existed after the amendment of employ the same language they must receive the same interpretation and not be construed differently If in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment in any year or have been under assessed or have been assessed at too low a rate or have been the subject of excessive relief under this Act the Incometax Officer may in any case in which he has reason to believe that the assessee has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof at any time within eight years and in any other case at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income profits or gains or in the case of a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and may proceed to assess or reassess such income profits or gains and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section The words escaping income in the Indian Income tax Act were interpreted as being applicable to a case where a person received notice under of the Income tax Act but the process ended in no assessment as to a case where there was no assessment at all because no notice was issued under of the Income tax Act in other words it includes cases where the process of assessment did not commence because no notice was given under of the Income tax Act due to inadvertence oversight negligence or any other cause as to cases where such notice proved abortive or ineffective <NAME> observed We see no justification for holding that cases of income escaping assessment must always be cases where income has not been assessed owing to inadvertence or oversight or owing to the fact that no return has been submitted if the Income tax Officer erroneously fails to tax a part of assessable income it is a case where the said part of the income has escaped assessment There assessment proceedings had been taken but had failed to result in a valid assessment owing to some lacuna other than that attributable to <ORG> and it was hold to be a case of chargeable income escaping assessment and not a case of mere nonassessment of income tax All these cases show that the words escaping assessment apply equally to cases where a notice was received by the assessee but resulted in no assessment at all and to cases where due to any reason no notice was issued to the assessee and therefore there was no assessment of his income It is also clear from the language of of the Act that when a notice is issued under that section all the requirements of the notice under apply and the Income tax Officer has to proceed in the manner as if the notice was issued under The same words in the same context as employed in of the Act must have the same meaning It becomes necessary therefore to examine the provisions of the Act as to the chargeable accounting periods and other provisions relevant thereto The Finance Act of did not continue the Act and it thus came to an end except for liabilities which had already arisen or accrued under the Act As the tax under the Act is charged levied and paid on the taxable profits of a chargeable accounting period but assessment is in respect of the financial year in which the Act operates it is not an unreasonable inference that notice for the chargeable accounting period must issue in the financial year following that period Taking a calendar year as the accounting period for the financial year the chargeable accounting period would be the nine months period from April to December and notice under of the Act must issue in the financial year because the tax is leviable and assessment is made for the year beginning April when the Act came into force and remained operative during the year After the Finance Act of the accounting year if it was a calendar year became divided into two parts and both were assessable in the assessment year beginning with April and therefore notice had to be given in the financial year Similarly in the financial year notice would have to be given in that year for the preceding chargeable accounting period In this view of the matter the contention that there is no provision in of the Act as to the chargeable accounting period as there is for the previous year in of the Income tax Act is not well founded That the notion of the previous year or the accounting period is as much applicable to the Act as to the Indian Income tax Act is shown by reference to Computation of Profits Rules in the Schedule to the Act It must be given within the financial year which commences next after the expire of the accounting period or the previous year which is by itself or includes the charge able accounting period in question The language of and particularly the words may proceed to assess or reassess the amount of such profits to Business Profits Tax support the contention of the respondent that it applies to cases of no assessment due to notice not being given as to cases of no assessment after notice was given and proceedings proved ineffective The words assess and reassess do not mean the same thing and signify two different cases The former applies to cases where there was no assessment to tax due to notice not being given and the process has to commence with the issuing of such notice and the latter to cases where the assessment process is recommenced by issuing a second notice the previous notice having proved abortive or resulting in under assessment etc Construing in this manner effect is given to the words profits of any chargeable accounting period have escaped assessment and it also avoids the anomaly that some cases where there was no assessment can be dealt with under one section with a time limit as under but other equally clear cases of non assessment are dealt with under I Rang It cannot be said that this was without any purpose and the argument that prescribing the period of limitation in of the Act was deliberate and was intended to prevent taxing under the Act of profits which had escaped assessment for four years from the end of the chargeable accounting period in question is not without substance It was argued for the appellant that construed according to the plain meaning of the words used therein applies to original assessments and to assessments in which notice was given but due to any cause whatsoever the proceedings resulted in no assessment or in under assessment He referred to the words require any person whom he believes to be engaged in any business or to have been engaged during any chargeable accounting period or to be otherwise liable and submitted that these words mean that if an Income tax Officer has such belief in regard to a person who is engaged in any business or was engaged in any business during any chargeable accounting period in question he can issue a notice at any time without limitation of time requiring a return to be filed etc In the former case a notice was issued to the assessee under of the East African Income Tax Management Act which provided The commissioner may by notice in writing require any person to furnish him within a reasonable time not being less than thirty days from the date of service of such notice with a return of income Sections and provided The assessee contended that did not apply until the machinery under had been put into operation and that the assessments were ultra vires and void because they were made before the time allowed by Accepting the contention of the assessee Lord <NAME> of <ORG> observed If the power to make an assessment under section applies to the making of an orginal assessment their Lordships are unable to imply a term restricting it to back cases or making it ultra vires to operate it at any time Section was held not applicable because there would be two concurrent jurisdictions one providing reasonable protection for the taxpayer and the other providing no protection which would be contrary to the provisions of It applies to cases of profits escaping assessment and the words escaping assessment have already been interpreted under of the Income tax Act and there is no reason why the same words occurring in a statute which is in pair material should be given a different meaning in the two Acts Further the difficulty which <ORG> felt in regard to there being two jurisdictions one giving protection to the assessee and the other not giving such protection does not exist in the present case because the process of assessment under of the Act is exactly the same as it is where notice is given under of the Act and all the advantages which an assessee would have under are available to him under The Punjab case to which our attention has been drawn was a case under the Excess Profits Tax Act and it was held that because of the removal of the limitation clause in of that Act assessments were not hit by any period of limitation and a further observation not necessary for the decision of the case was made that even otherwise the language of of that Act was wide and there was no substance in the contention that after the assessment period a notice under of that Act could not be issued and that the only notice which could be given was one under We accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs HIDAYATULLAH The Commissioner of <ORG> Bombay has filed this appeal against the judgment and order of <ORG> dated September with the certificate of <ORG> granted under of the Business Profits Tax Act hereinafter called the Act read with of the Indian Income tax Act Both the questions were then answered by <ORG> in the negative The Income tax Officer may for the purposes of this Act require any person whom he believes to be engaged in any business to which this Act applies or to have been so engaged during any chargeable accounting period or to be otherwise liable to pay business profits tax to furnish within such period not being less than forty five days from the date of the service of the notice as may be specified in the notice a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner setting forth along with such other particulars as may be provided for in the notice with respect to any chargeable accounting period specified in the notice the profits the taxable profits of the business or the amount of deficiency if any available for relief under section Provided that the Income tax Officer may in his discretion extend the date for the delivery of the return If in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that profits of any chargeable accounting period chargeable to business profits tax have escaped assessment or have been under assessed or have been the subject of excessive relief he may at any time within four years of the end of the chargeable accounting period in question serve on the person liable to such tax a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under section II and may proceed to assess or reassess the amount of such profits liable to business profits tax and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply as if the notice were a notice issued under that section The <ORG> construe both these sections together and expressed the opinion that the notice under in respect of a chargeable accounting period should issue before the commencement of the next chargeable accounting period and that if the notice was not so issued profits must be considered to have escaped assessment and that action could only be taken under within four years of the close of the chargeable accounting period in respect of which it was sought to tax the assessee <ORG> did not accept that the notice under had to be given before the end of the chargeable accounting period but held that the two sections must be interpreted together and observed Inasmuch as section does not indicate any period of time with regard to the issue of a notice would it or would it not be right for us to import into section the consideration which led the <ORG> to fix a limitation of time for the purpose of issuing a notice under section If we were not to do that we would arrive at this rather extraordinary conclusion that the <ORG> while saving the subject from harassment of proceedings with regard to escaped assessment or under assessment permitted that harassment with regard to the very initiation of the proceedings after the lapse of four years It is contended that the period of four years mentioned in section supplies an important indication for what the period of limitation should be with regard to the is tie of a notice under section If income which has escaped assessment can only be taxed within four years by reason of section then it must inferentially follow that income must escape assessment at some point of time anterior to the period of four years mentioned in section The notice under it is submitted next is without any limit of time and a limitation cannot be read into a section when the legislature has not thought it fit to lay it down According to the Commissioner deals with escaped assessment which under the scheme of the Act must be given a narrow meaning as indicating the escapement of profits from tax either wholly or partly for any reason after the process of assessment has taken place As against this the assessee firm adopts the reasons given by the <ORG> and <ORG> and adds that whereas under some definite information must be possessed by the Incometax Officer before he can issue the notice the Incometax Officer has only to entertain a belief that business was carried on in the chargeable accounting period to enable him to serve the notice under The Commissioner contends that the liability to pay tax arises under of the Act and it remains till the liability is discharged by payment of tax and the legislature has therefore advisedly left the power to the Income tax Officer to assess the tax where there has been no proceeding to assess it without imposing any limit as to time The learned Chief Justice of <ORG> who delivered the judgment of the Bench stated that it was not an easy matter to give a rational meaning to them The Income tax Officer has further power to issue a notice to any individual assessee during any assessment year calling for a return of his income during the previous year An assessee under the Income tax Act is therefore bound if his income is liable to tax to file a return whether it be in answer to the general notice or to the special notice issued to him The assessee may even file a return voluntarily before the special notice is issued to him Even before though there was no general notice the distinction between the previous year and the assessment year obtained Business profits follow the assessment of income tax and are payable for any chargeable accounting period in which the assessee having carried on business assessable profits have resulted Under the Act the Income tax Officer if he has reason to believe that the assessee was engaged in any business to which the Act applied or to have been so engaged during any chargeable accounting period or to be otherwise liable to pay business profits tax can call upon the assessee to furnish a return Then comes which says that if in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that profits of any chargeable accounting period chargeable to business profits tax have escaped assessment he may at any time within four years from the end of the chargeable accounting period in question serve on the person liable to such tax a notice There is no compulsion to file a return except in answer to a notice issued either under or There is no period comparable to the assessment year The question thus is whether a narrow meaning should be given to the words profits which have escaped assessment as denoting only those profits which by reason of a prior notice under were sought to be assessed but had escaped assessment or a wide meaning to include those profits which were never sought to be assessed or brought under assessment by the issuance of a notice under Then comes which is the charging sections That section omitting the provisions about exemptions which do not concern us reads Subject to the provisions of this Act there shall in respect of any business to which this Act applies be charged levied and paid on the amount of the taxable profits during any chargeable accounting period a tax in his Act referred to as business profits tax which shall in respect of any chargeable accounting period ending on or before the st day of March be equal to sixteen and two thirds per cent That section omitting again the provisos that do not affect the present matter provides This Act shall apply to every business of which any part of the profits made during the chargeable accounting period is chargeable to income tax by virtue of the provisions of sub clause i or subclause ii of clause of subsection of section of the Indian Income tax Act or of clause of that sub section Provided omitted It will appear from these sections quoted that the business profits tax comes in the wake of the incometax <NAME> Act which imposes a tax and which cannot be added to or subtracted from except perhaps for the most clear and compelling reasons The Commissioner contends that the liability to pay the tax in the case of a business not brought to tax does not cease by reason of any passage of time The commissioner may by notice in writing require any person to furnish him within a reasonable time not being less than thirty days from the date of service of such notice with a return of income and of such particulars as may be required for the purposes of this Act with respect to the income upon which such person appears to be chargeable Under the third sub section of that section a duty was laid upon every person to give notice to the Commissioner before October in the year following the year of income that he was so chargeable where no notice had been served under sub and no return had been furnished within nine months of the close of the year of account The section provided by sub for cases in which a return was made which was a accepted and not accepted and by sub for cases where no return was filed <NAME> Now the Commissioner in the cited case justified the assessments under because it was contended that the assessments were ultra vires and void in that they were made before the time allowed He relied upon the general words of and submitted that they covered even a case where a person was not assessed whether he had a notice and a time allowed under ss and or not The argument on behalf of the taxpayer was that only dealt with cases where subsequent information led either to an assessment after a prior assessment or to an additional assessment but had no application to cases in which the machinery of had not been operated It however gave a narrow meaning to the words as to assessing for the first time in as restricted to cases in which the machinery of having been operated no assessment has been made Their Lordships gave three reasons for this conclusion which may be set out in their own words If the power to make an assessment under section applies to the making of an original assessment their Lordships are unable to imply a term restricting it to back cases or making it ultra vires to operate it at any time Section deals inter alia with additional assessments with cases in which owing presumably to subsequent information the <ORG> desires to reopen what had apart from section been settled Having regard to the wording of section it seems to their Lordships necessary to restrict the words as to assessing for the first time in section to cases in which the machinery of section having been operated no assessment has been made On the other argument it seems reasonable that there should after a certain time be no reopening of what has been settled unless there has been fraud or willful default It was held by <NAME> and <NAME> that of the Indian Income tax Act was wide enough to include those cases in which there was no notice under or a first assessment <NAME> dissented from the observations of Sir <NAME> in are <NAME> made obiter that income cannot be said to have escaped assessment except in the case where an assessment has been made which does not include the income and observed Under what must be escaped is assessment and that means the whole process of assessment which in the case of individuals starts with the service of a notice under The liability to assessment is a risk to which every person in British India entitled to income is liable and I cannot see why the process of assessment has not been just as much escaped by a person who receives no notice under as by a person who receives such a notice which proves in fact ineffective It seems to me that a person who receives no notice under has escaped assessment although through no fault of his own the process of assessment has never been set in motion observed We are of opinion that is applicable to cases in which either no assessment at all has been made upon the person who received the income profits or gains liable to assessment or where an assessment has been made in the course of the year but some portion of the income profits or gains of such assessee for some reason or other has not been included in the order of assessment such income is income which has escaped assessment in the year and falls within the ambit of of the Act These cases arose before the amendments of and in those days there was no provision for a general I Cal The Act followed the Excess Profits Tax Act which provided for the levy of tax on excess profits made during the chargeable accounting periods within the term beginning on the first day of September and ending on the thirty first day of March Thus by the amendment there was no limitation for bringing to tax profits which had escaped assessment and it was so held by <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The fact that there was no corresponding change in the Act it is said shows that no first assessment or reassessment could be made after a lapse of four years Such assessment or reassessment could be made at any time or even after considerable time According to the <ORG> the notice under that section must issue before the end of the chargeable accounting period and according to <ORG> within four years from the end thereof There is nothing in the section which justifies any of these two readings The first two categories clearly show that whereas for the first category the assessee must be engaged in business in the year of notice for the second category the notice may issue in respect of a back chargeable accounting period The liability that is incurred can only be discharged by payment of the tax and the charging and levying are duties laid upon the Income tax Officers who execute them by issuing a notice under and by assessing and demanding the tax For this purpose it is admitted on all hands there is no express limitation in or elsewhere The question next is whether there is anything in which impliedly imposes such a limitation That section deals with escaped assessment under assessment or excessive relief In where the words escaped assessment are used it means that there was a determination of the amount of the tax payable but some profits escaped that process either wholly or partly to have escaped assessment when there are proceedings afoot and assessment is being made If under the liability to tax exists and there is no limitation and if under it can be II I A If the profits are still assessable by reason of the charge under and are subject to the process under there is no escaped assessment There are here no back periods which cannot be reached under like the period prior to the previous year of the Income tax Act for which only is available Also if profits which have never been processed can be dealt with both under ss and and both have the limit of years why have two sections one depending on belief and the other on definite information We must look to some different meaning and different fields of operation That can only be if the words escaped assessment are given a restricted meaning in In this view of the scheme of the Act and the clear words of II it seems difficult to put a limit of time because one is contained in in respect of profits escaping assessment In the Act with which we are concerned reconciliation is only possible if the words of and are given meanings without importing certain implications from one into the other and the only way different fields can be found is to read them differently Definite information denotes that there is something discovered which can demonstrate the falsity of something done previously To summarise therefore though it is possible to make the chargeable accounting period correspond to the previous year under the Income tax law there is no method by which the conception of an assessment year can be brought in The legislature might have been solicitous that persons who have been subjected to the process of assessment once should not be exposed to a second peril except within the reasonable period of four years from the end of the chargeable accounting period but it did not view in a similar way those persons who were never troubled before but whose liability to pay tax remained unaltered Such situations are avoided if the operation of is confined to those cases where there has been no prior assessment and the operation of to those cases where after a prior assessment there is an escaped assessment under assessment or excessive relief For the subsequent and reopened assessment there is a limit of four years but for the assessment for the first time there is no limit If as has been shown above there is no limitation either under or of the Excess Profits Tax Act will have to be applied to that Act without any limit as to time It appears to me that is not framed in consonance with the spirit underlying II and if it was necessary for me to say so I would have been disposed to thinking that being a Rule of <ORG> it would have to give way even though under the Act it has to be read as a part thereof I would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and below BY COURT In accordance with the judgment of the majority the appeal is dismissed with costs
