For the purposes of the questions we have to consider in this appeal the material facts are as follows In July the father of the plaintiffs mortgaged certain lands to certain parties whose interest is now vested in the defendants The plaintiffs preferred a claim to the attached property Assuming this to have been so we think it must be taken that there was an investigation within the meaning of this word used in the sections the order was there is nothing to show that the petitioner land have been attached and it was held there was no order within the meaning of the section In that case the <ORG> held in effect that there was no occasion to investigate since there was nothing to show the lands had been attached It was argued on behalf of the respondents that the decree of <ORG> could be upheld upon the ground that the property not having been sold in execution of the decree and the decree having been satisfied the order was not conclusive as between the plaintiffs and the defendants The argument was that the decree having been eventually satisfied there was no reason for the plaintiffs to bring a suit and the fact that it was not satisfied until after the expiration of a year from the date of the order was immaterial observation is as follows The finding of the <ORG> in the execution department that the sale was invalid only meant that the sale was invalid as against the judgment creditor and as against any purchaser who might purchase at a sale held in execution following that attachment Further there is nothing to show that in the Calcutta case the payment off was not made within a year from the date of the order dismissing the claim He preferred a claim in the execution proceedings under Section and the claim was dismissed by an order under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure He at once paid off the decree amount and the attachment was raised It was held that when the attachment was removed after the payment of the decrial amount there was no longer any attachment or proceeding in execution in which the order could operate to the prejudice of the plaintiff and therefore there was no necessity for him to bring a suit to sot aside the order the report does not state when the decree amount was paid off though there is nothing to suggest it was paid off more than a year after the making of the order To hold that the right of an unsuccessful claimant to bring a suit remains in a state of suspended animation for an indefinite period after the expiration of a year from the date of the order against him liable to be revived at any moment by the payment off of the amount of the decree would lead to great inconvenience There remains the question of res judicata If the plaintiffs claim in the present suit is res judicata we fire of course precluded from giving effect to the view indicated above and we must dismiss the appeal As regards items Nos to in that suit the suit was dismissed on the ground that on the construction of the mortgage deed the plaintiffs were not entitle to redeem these lands before the th July It seems to us that that case may be distinguished on the ground that the parties were not the same in the two suits but <NAME>wever this may be the judgment in that case appears to have been proceeded on the ground that the decree relied on as res judicata was based on a misapprehension as to a general rule of law This payment was made by the defendants after the alleged sale to them and it was made for the purpose of clearing their title under the sale deed to them We dismiss the appeal but without costs
