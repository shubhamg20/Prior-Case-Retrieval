This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the decree of the Temporary Subordinate Judge of Ramnad dated st September in a suit to enforce a mortgage <NAME> has subsequently sold the properties and the purchasers of the houses are parties to this suit In the meantime house property in Madura had risen considerably in value and the plaintiff instituted this suit in December claiming over Rs on her mortgage offering to redeem <NAME> or his assignees but claims to do so on payment of what would be found due on the prior mortgages up to the date of delivery of possession to <NAME> <NAME> and his assignees on the other hand claim the whole amount that would be found due according to the terms of the deeds of mortgage up to the date of payment without taking into account the profits or the income which they have received from the lands and houses The learned Judge in the <ORG> below has substantially accepted the contention of <NAME> and allowed the amount due up to the date of the written statement in this suit why that particular date was fixed is not clear though in calculating the sum due he made a mistake A mortgagee who sues for foreclosure of the equity of redemption or for the sale of the secured properties if he succeeds gets the title of the mortgagor as it stood on the date of his mortgage or transfers that title to the purchaser free from all interests or liens subsequently created by the mortgagor provided he makes the owners of such interests or liens parties to the suit but if he omits to make any of them parties their rights or liabilities are not affected but the purchaser we are concerned in this case only with sales though the same principle would apply to foreclosure also would acquire the rights in the mortgaged properties of all the persons who were parties just as if he had obtained an assignment from all of them without however a merger of the interests or extinction of the liens so acquired The matter may also be viewed in another aspect which brings it closer to the present question The mortgagor having given money worth to the purchaser to pay all the encumbrances when the purchaser pays them or any of them he does so really with the money of the mortgagor and the mortgage is extinguished in just the same way as if it had been paid by the mortgagor himself pro vided that the purchaser is not deprived of the property given to him If before he is deprived of the property given to him by the mortgagor he has derived any benefit from it to that extent it is the mortgagor money in his hands for which he must account in a suit to redeem him It follows therefore that if the mortgagor or the owner of the final equity of redemption is not made a party to the suit the purchaser at the sale at the best acquires only the interest of the mortgagee and he can be redeemed on payment of whatever is due on the mortgage at the time of payment on taking accounts as if such purchaser was a legal assignee of the mortgage The th defendant and his assignees would therefore be entitled to the principal and interest due on foot of the two mortgages dated March and September and be bound to account for the rents and profits of the properties from the respective dates on which the th defendant obtained possession through <ORG> the account being carried up to the date fixed for payment Their Lordships in <ORG> altered the rate of interest to that provided in the bond and the reason given by their Lordships for their alteration is this The <ORG> power to regulate interest is given by Section of Act XXIII of which answers to the th Section of the present Civil Procedure Code If <NAME> had not got a decree and the plaintiff had come to redeem her mortgage he must have paid whatever interest her contract entitled her to and the <ORG> would have had no jurisdiction to cut it down and that is the position in which the parties are placed by the decree in this suit That to our minds is conclusive to show that the mortgage which is revived against the puisne mortgagee though extinguished against the mortgagor is kept alive to the fullest extent as if no action had ever been brought on it He purchased the property from the mortgagor the price settled being Rs Before the sale the mortgagor had mortgaged the same property to the defendant who sued the plaintiff who had succeeded to her father brought the properties to sale and purchased them himself subject to the previous encumbrances of the plaintiff The reasons given for this conclusion are that as the mortgagee and mortgagor agreed that after the sale the property should be enjoyed for the price settled the mortgagee is not entitled to any compensation in the shape of interest for his money so long as he had the enjoyment that the prior mortgage is kept alive only to a limited extent and in each case the Court is to determine how far it is kept alive for doing justice Such a stipulation operates to extinguish or release a portion of the debt and there is no question of merger against the mortgagor and no merger against the mesne encumbrancers So long then as the prior mortgage is kept alive the senior mortgagee is entitled to the rights and is subject to the liabilities under his mortgage against the puisne encumbrancer We therefore think that in that case the plaintiff was entitled to the interest on the simple mortgage as she was entitled to take the profits in lieu of interest on the usufructuary mortgage and there was no money of the mortgagors in her hands for which she was bound to account to which we have already drawn attention Under the bond there was no interest payable and the usufruct was to be taken in lieu of it that every person who purchases property for a certain value must be presumed to pay such value as would yield to him a sufficient return for the money invested by him in the property In this case there were three mortgages It is not a case of a person who did not get what he bargained for and the vendee was not entitled to even the principal of the mortgages which he paid much less to interest the learned Judges one of whom was <NAME> came to just the opposite conclusion and held that a purchaser at a senior mortgagee execution sale who obtains possession from a prior usufructuary mortgagee whom he redeemed after his purchase was entitled to the whole of the principal and interest at the contract rate till the date of the suit It would therefore appear that there is no authority in support of such a broad contention as that raised here by the respondent However that may be the decision of <ORG> and the decisions of this <ORG> to which we have already referred are conclusive on this point and there is no need to speculate on the theoretical basis of this doctrine though we have ventured to point out that on principle the purchaser may justly be held liable to account for the profits in cases like the present In these lands the th defendant acquired absolute rights and he has sold them to persons who are not parties now Assuming that that section applies to this case the th respondent cannot be considered to be a bona fide purchaser as the sale certificate to the th defendant of which the th defendant had notice before her sale distinctly mentions the encumbrance to the plaintiff husband as a subsisting lien Before passing a final decree it would be necessary to have a finding on the amount due to the th defendant on taking accounts on the basis above set out The amount paid by the th defendant on the mortgage to the Fund is Rs The second objection relates to the question whether interest ought to be allowed on that portion of the amount paid by the th defendant to the chit fund which consisted of interest on the original bond There is nothing in our judgment to show that the th defendant who paid the amount due was to be deprived of interest on any portion of the money paid by him
