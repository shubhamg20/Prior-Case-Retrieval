For that purpose we may briefly notice the facts giving rise to the present appeals It has come in evidence that there used to be quarrels between the Accused no his brother and wife on the one side and the deceased <NAME> his wife <NAME> and daughter <NAME> on the other The railway police investigating officer Mr <NAME> PW conducted investigation and registered a case vide Crime No on th November against the three accused namely <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> However Accused Nos and were acquitted as according to the trial court the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against these accused As would appear from the above narrated factual matrix it is a case of circumstantial evidence and there is no eye witness or other direct evidence in regard to the murder of the three deceased persons At this stage we may usefully refer to the circumstances which were relied upon by the prosecution before the courts and they were as follows i Motive dispute over agricultural land partition In the facts and circumstances of the case <ORG> expressed the opinion that two circumstances i the last seen together and the homicidal death stands proved by themselves and do not require further evidence to prove that fact We fully agree with the view expressed by <ORG> that keeping in view the photographs of the dead body and the doctor statement it was proved to be a homicidal death It disregarded the statement of <ORG> while fully relying upon and holding that there were witnesses who were truthful and can be safely relied upon the Court held as under To sum up the assessment of evidence of these seven vital witnesses we may say that PW <NAME> has made himself sufficiently useless for the prosecution XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX We have subjected the evidence to close scrutiny and only thereafter arrived at our conclusion as to whether witnesses are to be believed and if yes to what extent learned A has propounded that in case accused makes a statement under section of We may state it here itself that explanation offered by the accused about his having received a message from <NAME> of Village Padali who received telephone of the deceased <NAME> of the three victims having gone to Pandharpur cannot be said to have been probabilised in the absence of evidence of said <NAME> In the light of acquittal of Accused Nos and by the trial court learned Advocate for the appellant has placed reliance upon the observations of <ORG> in the matter of <NAME> Delhi Administration A I and more particularly observation to the following effect in para where witnesses make tow sic inconsistent statements in their evidence either at one stage or at two stages the testimony of such witnesses becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence and in absence of special circumstances no conviction can be based on the evidence of such witness As can be seen from the impugned judgment in the present matter Accused No and are acquitted by <ORG> because there is no evidence referring to them The <ORG> is expected to keep in mind the facts and circumstances of a case the principles of law governing award of sentence the legislative intent of special or general statute raised in the case and the impact of awarding punishment These are the nuances which need to be examined by the <ORG> with discernment and in depth clearly demonstrates the concern of the legislature for taking away a human life and imposing death penalty upon the accused Concern for the dignity of the human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentalities and that ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases unless the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed In exercise of its discretion the <ORG> would also take into consideration the mitigating circumstances and their resultant effects Language of Section demonstrates the legislative concern and the conditions which need to be satisfied prior to imposition of death penalty The words in the case of sentence of death the special reasons for such sentence unambiguously demonstrates the command of the legislature that such reasons have to be recorded for imposing the punishment of death sentence This is how the concept of rarest of rare cases has emerged in law The death penalty should be imposed in rarest of rare cases and that too for special reasons to be recorded ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also required to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the Crime iii Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception Death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised The judgment in the case of <NAME> supra did not only state the above guidelines in some elaboration but also specified the mitigating circumstances which could be considered by the <ORG> while determining such serious issues and they are as follows Mitigating circumstances In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases the court shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance If the accused is young or old he shall not be sentenced to death The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated The <ORG> shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions and above That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct Now we may examine certain illustrations arising from the judicial pronouncements of this <ORG> While specifying the reasons in support of such decision the Court awarded death penalty in that case In that case the friends of the victim had called him to see a movie and after seeing the movie a ransom call was made but with the fear of being caught they murdered the victim The <ORG> felt that there was no evidence to show that the criminals were incapable of reforming themselves that it was not a rarest of rare case and therefore declined to award death sentence to the accused Similarly the intensity of bitterness which prevailed and the escalation of simmering thoughts into a thirst for revenge and retaliation were also considered to be a relevant factor by this <ORG> in different cases This <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra also considered various doctrines principles and factors which would be considered by the <ORG>s while dealing with such cases The <ORG> discussed in some elaboration the applicability of doctrine of rehabilitation and the doctrine of prudence While considering the application of the doctrine of rehabilitation and the extent of weightage to be given to the mitigating circumstances it noticed the nature of the evidence and the background of the accused Thus applying the doctrine of prudence it noticed the fact that the accused were unemployed young men in search of job and they were not criminals In execution of a plan proposed by the appellant and accepted by others they kidnapped a friend of theirs The kidnapping was done with the motive of procuring ransom from his family but later they murdered him because of the fear of getting caught and later cut the body into pieces and disposed it off at different places One of the accused had turned approver and as already noticed the conviction was primarily based upon the statement of the approver We do not think that the reasons assigned by the courts below disclose any special reason to uphold the death penalty There are no special reasons to record the death penalty and the mitigating factors in the present case discussed previously are in our opinion sufficient to place it out of the rarest of rare category The above principle as supported by case illustrations clearly depicts the various precepts which would govern the exercise of judicial discretion by the <ORG> within the parameters spelt out under Section of the Awarding of death sentence amounts to taking away the life of an individual which is the most valuable right available whether viewed from the constitutional point of view or from the human rights point of view The condition of providing special reasons for awarding death penalty is not to be construed linguistically but it is to satisfy the basic features of a reasoning supporting and making award of death penalty unquestionable The circumstances and the manner of committing the crime should be such that it pricks the judicial conscience of the <ORG> to the extent that the only and inevitable conclusion should be awarding of death penalty There were continuous quarrels with regard to the division of property and during these quarrels the accused is stated to have even hit his father Resultantly in view of the above factual matrix and the legal analysis we do not find that the present case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases For the reasons afore recorded we dismiss both the appeals
