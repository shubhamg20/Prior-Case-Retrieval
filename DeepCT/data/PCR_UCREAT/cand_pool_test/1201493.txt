The right to life is not one of the rights mentioned in Article of the Constitution and the six fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article are not absolute rights The Indian Penal Code particularly those of its provisions which cannot be justified on the ground of unreasonableness with reference to any of the specified heads such as public order in clauses and is not a law imposing restrictions on any of the rights conferred by Article There are several offences under the Penal Code such as theft cheating ordinary assault which do not violate or affect public order but only law and order It may be noted that general public interest is not specified as a head in clauses to on which restriction on the rights mentioned in clause i of the Article may be justified Indeed there is no dispute that the test of pith and substance of the subject matter and of direct and of incidental effect of legislation is a very useful test to determine the question of legislative competence i in ascertaining whether an Act falls under one Entry while incidentally encroaching upon another Entry It must pass the test of reasonable ness under the relevant head in clauses to of that Article It will have to be ascertained further whether by its direct and immediate operation the impugned legislation abridges any of the rights enumerated in Article The mere fact that the impugned law incidentally remotely or collaterally has the effect of abridging or abrogating those rights will not satisfy the test If the answer to the above queries be in the affirmative the impugned law in order to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness under Article Section prescribes death or imprisonment for life as penalty for murder It cannot be said that the object of the penal laws is generally such as not to involve any violation of the rights conferred by Article because after the decision of this <ORG> in the <ORG> case the theory that the object and form of the <ORG> action alone determine the extent of protection that may be claimed by an individual and that the effect of the <ORG> action on the fundamental right of the individual is irrelevant stands discredited But the point of the matter is that in pith and substance penal laws do not deal with the subject matter of rights enshrined in Article There is initial presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the state and the burden of rebutting that presumption is thrown on the party who challenges the constitutionality on the ground of Article Behind the view that there is a presumption of constitutionality of a statute and the onus to rebut the same lies on those who challenge the legislation is the rationale of judicial restraint a recognition of the limits of judicial review a respect for the boundaries of legislative and judicial functions and the judicial responsibility to guard the trespass from one side or the other Even where the burden is on the <ORG> to show that the restriction imposed by the impugned statute is reasonable and in public interest the extent and the manner of discharge of the burden necessarily depends on the subject matter of the legislation the nature of the inquiry and the scope and limits of judicial review ii In accordance with the interpretative principle indicated by <ORG> in <NAME> case Article will read as No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law or in its converse positive form as A person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law Article thus clearly brings out the implication that the Founding Fathers recognised the right of the <ORG> to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law India penal laws including the impugned provisions and their application are thus entirely in accord with its international commitment And section of the Code marks a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the Code as in force immediately before April according to which both the alternative sentences of death or imprisonment for life provided for murder and for certain other capital offences under the Penal Code were normal sentences Section of the Code provides for a bifurcated trial and specifically gives the accused person a right of pre sentence hearing at which stage he can bring on record material or evidence which may not be strictly relevant to or connected with the particular crime under inquiry but nevertheless have consistently with the policy underlined in section a bearing on the choice of sentence The present legislative policy discernible from section read with section is that in fixing the degree of punishment or making the choice of sentence for various offences including one under section Penal Code the <ORG> should not confine its consideration principally or merely to the circumstances connected with the particular crime but also give due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal But this much can be said that in order to qualify for inclusion in the category of aggravating circumstances which may form the basis of special reasons in section circumstances found on the facts of a particular case must evidence aggravation of an abnormal or special degree What is the relative weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case There are numerous other circumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence as there are countervailing circumstances of aggravation We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality Ordinarily on the principle of stare decisis Judges would hold themselves bound by the view taken in an earlier case and resist any attempt at reconsideration of the same issue There are certain issues which transcend technical considerations of stare decisis and if such an issue is brought before the <ORG> it would be nothing short of abdication of its constitutional duty for the <ORG> to refuse to consider such issue by taking refuge under the doctrine of stare decisis In the present case there are two other supervening circumstances which justify may compel re consideration of the decision in <NAME> case It is not a mere pedantic legal text but it embodies certain human values cherished principles and spiritual norms and recognises and upholds the dignity of man The several provisions enacted in the constitutions for the purpose of ensuring the dignity of the individual and providing for his material moral and spiritual development would be meaningless and ineffectual unless there is rule of law to invest them with life and force Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of the rule of law Law in the context of the rule of law does not mean any law enacted by the legislative authority howsoever arbitrary or despotic it may be Otherwise even under a dictatorship it would be possible to say that there is rule of law because every law made by the dictator howsoever arbitrary and unreasonable has to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in conformity with such law In such a case too even where the political set up is dictatorial it is law that governs the relationship between men and men and between men and the <ORG> What is a necessary element of the rule of law is that the law must not be arbitrary and irrational and it must satisfy the test of reason and the democratic form of polity seeks to ensure this element by making the framers of the law accountable to the people Apart from Article Clause of Article also recognises the possibility of a sentence of death being imposed on a person convicted of an offence inasmuch as it provides that the President shall have the power to suspend remit or commute the sentence of any person who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to death The Constitution is not a transient document but it is meant to endure for a long time to come and during its life situations may arise where death penalty may be found to serve a social purpose and its prescription may not be liable to be regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable and therefore to meet such situations the Constitution had to make a provision and this it did in Article and clause of Article so that even where death penalty is prescribed by any law and it is otherwise not unconstitutional it must still comply with the requirement of Article and it would be subject to the clemency power of the President under clause of Article This is the drastic nature of death penalty terrifying in its consequences which has to be taken into account in determining its constitutional validity Even the various studies carried out clearly establish beyond doubt that death penalty does not have any special deterrent effect which life sentence does not possess and that in any event there is no evidence at all to suggest that death penalty has any such special deterrent effect Death penalty as provided under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not sub serve any legitimate end of punishment since by killing the murderer it totally rejects the reformation purpose and it has no additional deterrent effect which life sentence does not possess and it is therefore not justified by the deterrence theory of punishment On a plain reading of section of the Indian Penal Code which provides death penalty as alternative punishment of murder it is clear that it leaves it entirely to the discretion of the <ORG> whether to impose death sentence or to award only life imprisonment to an accused convicted of the offence of murder It is left to the Judge to grope in the dark for himself and in the exercise of his unguided and unfettered discretion decide what reasons may be considered as special reasons justifying award of death penalty and whether in a given case any such special reasons exist which should persuade the <ORG> to depart from the normal rule and inflict death penalty on the accused What may appear as special reasons to one judge may not so appear to another and the decision in a given case whether to impose the death sentence or to let off the offender only with life imprisonment would to a large extent depend upon who is the judge called upon to make the decision Further the various decisions in which special reasons have been given singly and cumulatively indicate not merely that there is an enormous potential of arbitrary award of death penalty by the High <ORG> and <ORG> but that in fact death sentence have been awarded arbitrarily and freakishly When a law is challenged on the ground that it imposes restrictions on the freedom guaranteed by one or the other sub clause of clause of Article and the restrictions are shown to exist by the petitioner the burden of estabilshing that the restrictions fall within any of the permissive clauses to which may be applicable must rest upon the <ORG> The <ORG> would have to produce material for satisfying the <ORG> that the restrictions imposed by the impugned law fall with the appropriate permissive clause from out of clauses to of Article Of course there may be cases where the nature of the legislation and the restrictions imposed by it may be such that the <ORG> may without more even in the absence of any positive material produced by the <ORG> conclude that the restrictions fall within the permissible category as for example where a law is enacted by the legislature for giving effect to one of the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy and prima facie the restrictions imposed by it do not appear to be arbitrary or excessive But once it is shown by the petitioner that the impugned law imposes restrictions which infringe one or the other sub clause of clause of Article the burden of showing that such restrictions are reasonable and fall within the permissible category must be on the <ORG> and this burden the <ORG> may discharge either by producing socio economic data before the <ORG> or on consideration of the provisions in the impugned law read in the light of the constitutional goals set out in the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy The test to be applied for the purpose of determining whether the restrictions imposed by the impugned law are reasonable or not cannot be cast in a rigid formula of universal application Where therefore a law authorises deprivation of the right to life the reasonableness fairness and justness of the procedure prescribed by it for such deprivation must be established by the <ORG> The <ORG> must place the necesary material on record for the purpose of discharging this burden which lies upon it and if it fails to show by presenting adequate evidence before the <ORG> or otherwise that death penalty is not arbitrary and unreasonable and does serve a legitimate social purpose the imposition of death penalty under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure would have to be struck down as violative of the protection of Article There is a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the burden of showing that it is arbitrary or discriminatory lies upon the petitioner because it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds There may conceivably be cases where having regard to the nature and character of the legislation If the <ORG> fails to discharge this burden which rests upon it the <ORG> would have to hold that death penalty has not been shown to have greater deterrent effect and it does not therefore serve a rational legislative purpose <NAME> appeal by special leave came up for hearing before a Bench of this Court consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> It was submitted that neither the circumstance that the appellant was previously convicted for murder and committed these murder after he had served out the life sentence in the earlier case not the fact that these three murders were extremely heinous and inhuman constitutes a special reason for imposing the death sentence within the meaning of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Reliance for this argument was placed on <NAME> ibid which according to the counsel was on facts very similar if not identical to that case ii In <NAME> case <ORG> held The impossibility of laying down standards in the matter of sentencing is at the very core of criminal law as administered in India which invests the judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment and that this discretion in the matter of sentence in liable to be corrected by superior Courts The exercise of judicial discretion on well recognised principles is in the final analysis the safest possible safeguard for the accused This view again according to <NAME> is inconsistent with the law laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> wherein it was held that deprivation of life is constitutionally permissible if that is done according to procedure established by law as it stood before the amendment it is difficult to perceive how by requiring special reasons to be given the amended section would be unconstitutional unless the sentencing sector is made most restrictive and least vagarious Without expressing his own opinion on the various questions raised in that case including the one with regard to the scope amplification and application of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Sarkaria in agreement with <NAME> directed the records of the case to be submitted to the Hon ble the Chief Justice for constituting a large Bench to resolve the doubts difficulties and inconsistencies pointed out by <NAME> In the meanwhile several persons convicted of murders and sentenced to death filed writ petitions namely Writ Petitions and of under Article of the Constitution directly challenging the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided in Section of the Indian Penal Code for the offence of murder and the sentencing procedure provided in Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure That is how the matter has now come up before this larger Bench of five Judges Thirdly it is submitted that India has since acceded to the international Covenant of Civil and Political Rights adopted by <ORG> which came into force in December The learned Solicitor General <NAME> opposed the request of <NAME> for referring the matter to a larger Bench because such a course would only mean avoidable delay in disposal of the matter We have heard the arguments of <NAME> We have also heard the arguments of <NAME> Solicitor General appearing for <ORG> and <NAME> appearing for the State of Maharashtra and the other counsel appearing for the respondents The principal questions that fall to be considered in this case are I Whether death penalty provided for the offence of murder in Section Penal Code is unconstitutional Regarding death as a punishment the authors of the Code say We are convinced that it ought to be very sparingly inflicted and we propose to employ it only in cases where either murder or the highest offence against the <ORG> has been committed In the instant cases the impugned provision of the Indian Penal Code is Section which says Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and also be liable to fine The related provisions are contained in Sections and Its material part runs as follows Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death or Secondly If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death of the person to whom the harm is caused or Thirdly If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or Fourthly If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause Nothing in sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevents the <ORG> from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevents the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right con ferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise Broadly speaking Article is intended to protect the rights to the freedoms specifically enumerated in the six sub clauses of clause against <ORG> action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regulate these rights in the public interest relating to heads specified in clauses to The six fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article are not absolute rights Secondly under clauses to these rights have been expressly made subject to the power of the <ORG> to impose reasonable restrictions which may even extend to prohibition on the exercise of those rights The conferment of this power is founded on the fundamental truth that uncontrolled liberty entirely freed from restraint degenerates into a licence leading to anarchy and chaos that libertine pursuit of liberty absolutely free and free for all may mean liberticide for all It is important to note that whereas Article expressly deals with the right to life and personal liberty Article does not The right to life is not one of the rights mentioned in Article Thus considered can any one say that he has a legal right or fundamental freedom under Article to practise the profession of a hired assassin or to form associations or unions or engage in a conspiracy with the object of committing murders or dacoities The argument that the provisions of the Penal Code prescribing death sentence as an alternative penalty for murder have to be tested on the ground of Article appears to proceed on the fallacy that the freedoms guaranteed by Article are absolute freedoms and they cannot be curtailed by law imposing reasonable restrictions which may amount to total prohibition In that case the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competition Control Act as amended by Bombay Act No XXX of was challenged on the ground inter alia that it infringes the fundamental rights of the promoters of such competitions under Article to carry on their trade or business and that the restrictions imposed by the said Act cannot possibly be supported as reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public permissible under Article It was contended that the words trade or business or commerce in sub clause of Article a should be read in their widest amplitude as any activity which is undertaken or carried on with a view to earning profit since there is nothing in Article which may qualify or cut down the meaning of the critical words that there is no justification for excluding from the meaning of those words activities which may be looked upon with disfavour by the <ORG> or the <ORG> as injurious to public morality or public interest Thus there will be a guaranteed right to carry on a business of hiring out goondas to commit assault or even murder or house breaking or selling obscene pictures of trafficking in women and so on until the law curbs or stops such activities We have no doubt that there are certain activities which can under no circumstance be regarded as trade or business or commerce although the usual forms and instruments are employed therein It was contended on behalf of <NAME> that since the preventive detention order results in the detention of the detenu in a cell his rights specified in clauses a to and of Article have been infringed Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided At page of the Report ii Judged by the test of direct and indirect effect on the rights referred to in article the Penal Code is not a law imposing restrictions on these rights The test is that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the sub clauses If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of Article will arise Article cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty Article does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of personal liberty Personal liberty would primarily mean liberty of the physical body The rights given under article do not directly come under that description Page In my opinion therefore Article should be read as a separate complete Article In tune with <NAME> the learned Judge observed A construction which would bring within Article imprisonment in punishment of a crime committed or in prevention of a crime threatened would as it seems to me make a reductio ad absurdum of that provision If imprisonment were to be regarded as a restriction of the right mentioned in article it would equally be a restriction on the rights mentioned by the other sub clauses of clause with the result that all penal laws providing for imprisonment as a mode of punishment would have to run the gauntlet of clauses to before their validity could be accepted For instance the law which imprisons for theft would on that view fall to be justified under clause as a law sanctioning restriction of freedom of speech and expression Article confers the rights therein specified only on the citizens of India while article extends the protection of life and personal liberty to all persons citizens and non citizens alike Thus the two Articles do not operate in a coterminous field Personal liberty was used in Article as a sense which excludes the freedoms dealt in Article In his judgment an examination of the provisions of Article clearly suggests that the intention was to make it self contained as regards the law of preventive detention and that the validity of a law on the subject of preventive detention cannot be examined or controlled either by the provisions of Article or by the provisions of Article <NAME> explained the relative scope of the Articles in this group thus To me it seems that Article of the Constitution gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in the various clauses the restraints that may be placed upon them by law so that they may not conflict with public welfare or general morality On the other hand Articles and are primarily concerned with penal enactments or other laws under which personal safety or liberty of persons could be taken away in the interests of the society and they set down the limits within which the <ORG> control should be exercised In my opinion the group of articles to embody the entire protection guaranteed by the Constitution in relation to deprivation of life and personal liberty both with regard to substantive as well as to procedural law The only proper way of avoiding these anomalies is to interpret the two provisions articles and as applying to different subjects <NAME> also rejected the argument that the whole of the Indian Penal Code is a law imposing reasonable restriction on the rights conferred by Article with these observations at Page To say that every crime undermines the security of the State and therefore every section of the Indian Penal Code irrespective of whether it has any reference to speech or expression is a law within the meaning of this clause is wholly unconvincing and betrays only a vain and forlorn attempt to find an explanation for meeting the argument that any conviction by a Court of law must necessarily infringe article a There can be no getting away from the fact that a detention as a result of a conviction impairs the freedom of speech for beyond what is permissible under clause of article Likewise a detention on lawful conviction impairs each of the other personal rights mentioned in sub clauses to The argument that every section of the Indian Penal Code irrespective of whether it has any reference to any of the rights referred to in sub clauses to and is a law imposing reasonable restriction on those several rights has not even the merit of plausibility There can be no doubt that a detention as a result of lawful conviction must necessarily impair the fundamental personal rights guaranteed by article far beyond what is permissible under clauses to of that article and yet nobody can think of questioning the validity of the detention or of the section of the Indian Penal Code under which the sentence was passed rights protected by clause of article iii The learned Judge also held that article protects some of the important attributes of personal liberty as independent rights and the expression personal liberty has been used in article as a compendious term including within its meaning all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men The case of a person who is convicted of an offence will come under article and and also under article so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned Preventive detention which is dealt with in article also amounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is referred to in article <NAME> held that since preventive detention unlike punitive detention directly infringes the right under Article it must pass the test of clause According to the learned Judge only those laws are required to be tested on the anvil of Article which directly restrict any of the rights guaranteed in Article Applying this test of direct and indirect effect to the provisions of the Indian Penal Code the learned Judge pointed out that the Code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely The punishment may consist in imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty If it consists in a pecuniary penalty it obviously involves no restriction on movement but if it consists in imprisonment there is a restriction on movement This restraint is imposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining crime and making it punishable The punishment is correlated with the violation of some other person right and not with the right of movement possessed by the offender himself In my opinion therefore the Indian Penal Code does not come within the ambit of the words law imposing restriction on the right to move freely A person is punitively detained only after trial for committing a crime and after his guilt has been established in a competent court of justice A person so convicted can take his case to <ORG> and sometimes bring it to this Court also and he can in the course of the proceedings connected with his trial take all pleas available to him including the plea of want of jurisdiction of the Court of trial and the invalidity of the law under which he has been prosecuted The final judgment in the criminal trial will thus constitute a serious obstacle in his way if he chooses to assert even after his conviction that his right under article has been violated But a person who is preventively detained has not to face such an obstacle whatever other obstacle may be in his way Page We have copiously extracted from the judgments in A <NAME> case to show that all the propositions propounded arguments and reasons employed or approaches adopted by the learned Judges in that case in reaching the conclusion that the Indian Penal Code particularly those of its provisions which do not have a direct impact on the rights conferred by Article is not a law imposing restrictions on those rights have not been overruled or rendered bad by the subsequent pronouncements of this <ORG> in Bank Nationalizaton case or in <NAME> case For instance the proposition laid down by <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> that the Indian Penal Code particularly those of its provisions which cannot be justified on the ground on reasonableness with reference to any of the specified heads such as public order in clauses and is not a law imposing restrictions on any of the rights conferred by Article still holds the field that such a construction which treats every section of the Indian Penal Code as a law imposing restriction on the rights in Article will lead to absurdity is unassailable It may be noted that general public interest is not specified as a head in clauses to on which restriction on the rights mentioned in clause of the Article may be justified Suppose a person is convicted of an offence of cheating and prosecuted and imprisoned after trial it is not open to say that the imprisonment should be tested with reference to Article for its reasonableness The last sentence which has been underlined by us appears to lend implicit approval to the rule of construction adopted by the majority of the learned Judges in <NAME> case whereby they excluded from the purview of Article certain provisions of the Indian Penal Code providing punishment for certain offences which could not be tested on the specific grounds embodied in clauses to of that Article This proposition enunciated in <NAME> case is only a product of the application of the basic canon that a construction which would lead to absurdity should be eschewed It is the effect of the law and of the action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to grant relief The question is whether <NAME> <NAME> have given a complete go by to the test of direct and indirect effect sometimes described as form and object test or pith and substance rule which was adopted by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> in <NAME> case In the first place there is nothing much in the name Therein <NAME> quoted with approval the passages i and ii which we have extracted earlier from the judgment of <NAME> Although <NAME> and <NAME> JJ It was contended by the learned Attorney General in that case that since the impugned legislation was not a direct legislation on the subject of freedom of speech and expression Olson which was as under With respect to these contentions it is enough to say that in passing upon constitutional questions the <ORG> has regard to substance and not to mere matters of form and that in accordance with familiar principles the statute must be tested by its operation and effect <NAME> who delivered the unanimous Judgment of <ORG> after noting that the object of the impugned legislation is to provide for the amelioration of the conditions of the workmen in the newspaper industry overruled this contention of the employers thus That however would be a consequence which would be extraneous and not within the contemplation of the legislature emphasis added The learned Judge further observed that the impugned Act could be legitimately characterised as a measure which affects the press but its intention or the proximate effect and operation was not such as would take away or abridge the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed in Article a therefore it could not be held invalid on that ground an order prohibiting the publication of the evidence of a witness in a defamation case passed by a learned Judge <NAME> of <ORG> was impugned on the ground that it violated the petitioners right to free speech and expression guaranteed by Article a Whether the findings of fact recorded by the Judge are right or wrong and whether the conclusion of law drawn by him suffers from any infirmity can be considered and decided if the party aggrieved by the decision of the Judge takes the matter up before the appellate Court But it is singularly inappropriate to assume that a judicial decision pronounced by a Judge of competent jurisdiction in or in relation to matter brought before him for adjudication can affect the fundamental rights of the citizens under Article If the test of direct effect and object which is sometimes described as the pith and substance test is thus applied in considering the validity of legislation it would not be inappropriate to apply the same test to judicial decisions like the one with which we are concerned in the present proceedings Indeed there is no dispute that the test of pith and substance of the subject matter and of direct and of incidental effect of legislation is a very useful test to determine the question of legislative competence i in ascertaining whether an Act falls under one Entry while incidentally encroaching upon another Entry For instance if the subject matter of the legilation directly covers any of the fundamental freedoms mentioned in Article it must pass the test of reasonableness under the relevant head in clauses to of that Article It will have to be ascertained further whether by its direct and immediate operation the impugned legislation abridges any of the rights enumerated in Article From a survey of the cases noticed above a comprehensive test which can be formulated may be re stated as under Does the impugned law in its pith and substance whatever may be its form and object deal with any of the fundamental rights conferred by Article If it does does it abridge or abrogate any of those rights And even if it does not in its pith and substance deal with any of the fundamental rights conferred by Article is the Direct and inevitable effect of the impugned law such as to abridge or abrogate any of those rights The mere fact that the impugned law incidentally remotely or collaterally has the effect of abridging or abrogating those rights will not satisfy the test If the answer to the above queries be in the affirmative the impugned law in order to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness under Article Now let us apply this test to the provisions of the Penal Code in question Section prescribes death or imprisonment for life as penalty for murder We cannot of course say that the object of penal laws is generally such as not to involve any violation of the rights conferred by Article because after the decision of this <ORG> in the Bank Nationalization case the theory that the object and form of the <ORG> action alone determine the extent of protection that may be claimed by an individual and that the effect of the <ORG> action on the fundamental right of the individual is irrelevant stands discredited But the point of the matter is that in pith and substance penal laws do not deal with the subject matter of rights enshrined in Article Such a law i its provision defining the offence will directly and inevitably impinge upon the right guaranteed under clause a of Article Therefore to be valid it must pass the test of reasonableness embodied in clause of the Article it was laid down by this Court that if the writ petitioner succeeds in showing that the impugned law ex facie abridges or transgresses the rights coming under any of the sub clauses of clause of Article the onus shifts on the respondent state to show that the legislation comes within the permissible limits imposed by any of the clauses to as may be applicable to the case and also to place material before the court in support of that contention A contrary trend however is discernible in the recent decisions of this <ORG> which start with the initial presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the statute and throw the burden of rebutting that presumption on the party who challenges its constitutionality on the ground of Art It was emphasised that Judges act not by hunch but on hard facts properly brought on record and sufficiently strong to rebuff the initial presumption of constitutionality of legislation I page it was recalled Some courts have gone to the extent of holding that there is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and a law will not be declared unconstitutional unless the case is so clear as to be free from doubt and to doubt the constitutionality of a law is to resolve it in favour of its validity Behind the view that there is a presumption of constitutionality of a statute and the onus to rebut the same lies on those who challenge the legislation is the rationale of judicial restraint a recognition of the limits of judicial review a respect for the boundaries of legislative and judicial functions and the judicial responsibility to guard the trespass from one side or the other In that context the nature of the burden which rests on those who attack the constitutionality of the statute was explained by <NAME> thus We may not require the legislature to select the least severe penalty possible so long as the penalty selected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved Even where the burden is on the <ORG> to show that the restriction imposed by the impugned statute is reasonable and in public interest the extent and the manner of discharge of the burden necessarily depends on the subject matter of the legislation the nature of the inquiry and the scope and limits of judicial review There is no convincing evidence to show that death penalty serves any penological purpose i Its deterrent effect remains unproven It is proposed to deal with these arguments as far as possible in their serial order In the first place we will notice a few decisions of <ORG> wherein the deterrent value of death penalty has been judicially recognised He filed a petition for grant of special leave to appeal to this Court under Article of the Constitution It was contended on behalf of <NAME> that the very monstrosity of the crime provided proof of his insanity sufficient to exculpate the offender under Section Indian Penal Code or material for mitigation of the sentence of death It was further observed that horrendous features of the crime and the hapless and helpness state of the victim steel the heart of law for the sterner sentence The threat of instant death is the one to which resort has always been made when there was an absolute necessity for producing some result In his book Capital Punishment he has made an attempt to assemble the arguments for and against the death penalty To quote his words There is an additional point worth stressing We have already discussed in detail several aspects of this topic Prima facie the penalty of death is likely to have a stronger effect as a deterrent to normal human beings than any other form of punishment and there is some evidence though no convincing statistical evidence that this is in fact so The fact remains however that whenever there is a serious crime the society feels a sense of disapprobation If there is any element of retribution in the law as administered now it is not the instinct of the man of jungle but rather a refined evolution of that instinct the feeling prevails in the public is a fact of which notice is to be taken <NAME> the Canadian Parliamentarian justifies from another angle the right of the <ORG> to award capital punishment for murder If the <ORG> has the right and the duty to defend the community against outside aggression such as in time of war and within the country for instance in case of treason Raspberry Death Sentence <ORG> March cols and that to the extent of taking the life of the aggressors and guilty parties if the citizen wants to protect his own life by killing whoever attacks him without any reason the <ORG> can do the same when a criminal attacks and endangers the life of the community by deciding to eliminate summarily another human being As a deterrent the death penalty is playing its part for which there is no substitute I suggest that statistics do not prove much either on one side or the other There are too many variations too many changes as regards circumstances condition between one period and the other to enable us to make worthy comparisons There is always a danger in adhering too rigidly to concepts We must therefore view the problem against the perspective of the hard realities of the time and the conditions prevailing in the world particularly in our own country Another statement has been furnished showing the number of persons convicted of murder and other capital offences and sentenced to death in some of the States of India during the period to For the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the impugned provision as to death penalty in Section Penal Code on the ground of reasonableness in the light of Articles and of the Constitution it is not necessary for us to express any categorical opinion one way or the other as to which of these two antithetical views held by the Abolitionists and Retentionists is correct We will now consider the issue whether the impugned limb of the provision in Section Penal Code contravenes Article of the Constitution In <NAME> case which was a decision by a Bench of seven learned Judges it was held by <NAME> in his concurring judgment that the expression personal liberty in Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights under Article It was further observed that Articles and are not to be interpreted in water tight compartments and consequently a law depriving a person of personal liberty and prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the meaning of Article has to stand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article which may be applicable in a given situation ex hypothesi it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article The principle of reasonableness pervades all the three Articles with the result that the procedure contemplated by Article must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary fancifu or oppressive otherwise it should be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article would not be satisfied Article reads as under No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law If this Article is expanded in accordance with the interpretative principle indicated in <NAME> it will read as follows No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law In the converse positive form the expanded Article will read as below A peron may be deprived of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law Thus expanded and read for interpretative purposes Article clearly brings out the implication that the Founding Fathers recognised the right of the <ORG> to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair just and reasonable procedure established by valid law There are several other indications also in the Constitution which show that the Constitution makers were fully cognizant of the existence of death penalty for murder and certain other offences in the Indian Penal Code Article specifically invests the President with power to suspend remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence and also in all cases where the sentence is a sentence of death Article in terms gives a right of appeal to <ORG> to a person who on appeal is sentenced to death by <ORG> after reversal of his acquittal by <ORG> It is pointed out that India as a member of <ORG> was a participating delegate at the international conference that made the Stockholm Declaration on December that India has also accepted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by <ORG> which came into force on March and to which some countries including India are a party No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life India penal laws including the impugned provisions and their application are thus entirely in accord with its international commitment For all the foregoing reasons we would answer the first main question in the negative This takes us to Question No II As against this the learned Solicitor General submits that the policy of the law in the matter of imposition of death sentence is writ large and clear in Section namely that life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception that the correct approach should be to apply this policy to the relevant facts of the particular case bearing on the question of sentence and to find out if there are any exceptional reasons justifying imposition of the death penalty as a departure from the normal rule Since the discretion proceeds the argument is to be exercised judicially after taking into consideration all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the crime and the criminal in a particular case and ample safeguards by way of appeal and reference to the superior courts against erroneous or arbitrary exercise of the sentencing discretion have been provided Section cannot be said to be violative of Articles and or anything else in the Constitution Before embarking upon a discussion of the arguments advanced on both sides it is necessary to have a peep into the history and the legislative background of the procedural provisions relating to sentencing in the Code of criminal Procedure Under the Code of Criminal Procedure as it stood before its amendment by Act No of even for the seven offences mentioned earlier which are punishable in the alternative with death the normal sentence was the death sentence and if the <ORG> wanted to depart from this rule it had to give reasons for doing so I made the following comments on this provision a considerable body of opinion is in favour of a provision requiring the court to state its reasons for imposing the punishment either of death or of imprisonment for life In deferance to this recommendation section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Act XXVI of deleted old sub section of Section with effect from January and thereafter for such capital offences it was left to the <ORG> on the facts of each case to pass in its discretion for reason to be recorded the sentence of death or the lesser sentence As against this <ORG> of the Madras High <ORG> in Veluchami Thevar held that death was the normal punishment where there were no extenuating circumstances In that case there was a clear finding by <ORG> which had been upheld by <ORG> that each of the two appellants therein committed a cold blooded murder by shooting two inmates of the house simply with the object of facilitating commission of dacoity by them It was held by this Court speaking through Bhargava that in these circumstances where the murders were committed in cold blood with the sole object of committing dacoity the Sessions Judge had not exercised his discretion judicially in not imposing the death sentence and <ORG> was justified in enhancing the sentence of the appellants from life imprisonment to death Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure marks a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the Code of as in force immediately before Apr <ORG> in its Report stated the object and reason of making this change as follows A sentence of death is the extreme penalty of law and it is but fair that when a Court awards that sentence in a case where the alternative sentence of imprisonment for life is also available it should give special reasons in support of the sentence Accordingly sub section of Section of the current Code provides When the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or in the alternative with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years the judgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded and in the case of sentence of death the special reasons for such sentence It requires that If the accused is convicted the Judge shall unless he proceeds in accordance with the provisions of Section hear the accused on the question of sentence and then pass sentence on him according to law Sections and of the Code of continue Sections and of the Code of with necessary modifications which bring them in tune with Articles and of the Constitution Section confers on the appropriate <ORG> power to commute sentence without the consent of the person sentenced Restriction on powers of remission or commutation in certain cases Notwithstanding anything contained in Section where a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided by law or where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been commuted under Section into one of imprisonment for life such person shall not be released from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years of imprisonment We may next notice other provisions of the extent Code corresponding to Sections and of the repealed Code bearing on capital punishment Section gives power to <ORG> to direct further inquiry to be made or additional evidence to be taken These provisions seek to ensure that where in a capital case the life of the convicted person is at stake the entire evidential material bearing on the innocence or guilt of the accused and the question of sentence must be scrutinised with utmost caution and care by a superior Court <ORG> has been given very wide powers under these provisions to prevent any possible miscarriage of justice Finally there is Article of the Constitution under which <ORG> is empowered in its discretion to A I In the light of the above conspectus we will now consider the effect of the aforesaid legislative changes on the authority and efficacy of the propositions laid down by this <ORG> in <NAME> case These propositions may be summed up as under i The general legislative policy that underlines the structure of our criminal law principally contained in the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code is to define an offence with sufficient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment therefor and to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment Referred to <NAME> California The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment We do not have in our Constitution any provision like the Eighth Amendment nor are we at liberty to apply the test of reasonableness with the freedom with which the Judges of <ORG> are accustomed to apply the due process clause There are grave doubts about the expediency of transplanting western experience in our country Thus considered the provision in Section Penal Code is not violative of Article of the Constitution on the ground that it confers on the judges an unguided and uncontrolled discretion in the matter of awarding capital punishment of imprisonment for life Where counsel addresses the <ORG> with regard to the character and standing of the accused they are duly considered by the <ORG> unless there is something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public Prosecutor challenges the facts It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to choose either of the two alternative sentences provided in Section Penal Code the <ORG> is principally concerned with the facts and circumstances whether aggravating or mitigating which are connected with the particular crime under inquiry These provisions are part of the procedure established by law and unless it is shown that they are invalid for any other reasons they must be regarded as valid No reasons are offered to show that they are constitutionally invalid and hence the death sentence imposed after trial in accordance with the procedure established by law is not unconstitutional under Article This postulate has now been modified by Section which mandates the <ORG> convicting a person for an offence punishable with death or in the alternative with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years not to impose the sentence of death on that person unless there are special reasons to be recorded for such sentence It would thus be noticed that awarding of the sentence other than the sentence of death is the general rule now and only special reasons that is to say special facts and circumstances in a given case will warrant the passing of the death sentence Now Section provides for a bifurcated trial and specifically gives the accused person a right of pre sentence hearing at which stage he can bring on record material or evidence which may not be strictly relevant to or connected with the particular crime under inquiry but nevertheless have consistently with the policy underlined in Section a bearing on the choice of sentence The present legislative policy discernible from Section read with Section is that in fixing the degree of punishment or making the choice of sentence for various offences including one under Section Penal Code the <ORG> should not confine its consideration principally or merely to the circumstances connected with the particular crime but also give due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal The court can depart from that rule and impose the sentence of death only if there are special reasons for doing so Such reasons must be recorded in writing before imposing the death sentence While considering the question of sentence to be imposed for the offence of murder under Section Penal Code the court must have regard to every relevant circumstance relating to the crime as well as the criminal <ORG> could not but be aware that since the Amending Act of death penalty has been imposed by courts on an extremely small percentage of persons convicted of murder a fact which demonstrates that courts have generally exercised their discretion in inflicting this extreme penalty with great circumspection caution and restraint If by laying down standards it is meant that murder should be categorised before hand according to the degrees of its culpability and all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances should be exhaustively and rigidly enumerated so as to exclude all free play of discretion the argument merits rejection Firstly there is little agreement among penologists and jurists as to what information about the crime and criminal is relevant and what is not relevant for fixing the dose of punishment for a person convicted of a particular offence Even within a single category offence there are infinite unpredictable and unforceable variations Indeed there is a real danger of such mechanical standardisation degenerating into a bed of procrustean cruelty There is every danger despite their effort to make a rational guess of the notions of right and wrong prevailing in the community at large and despite their intention to abide by the dictates of mere reason that they might write their own peculiar view or personal pre dilection into the law sincerely mistaking that changeling for what they perceive to be the community ethic In this sensitive highly controversial area of death penalty with all its complexity vast implications and manifold ramifications even all the Judges sitting cloistered in this <ORG> and acting unanimously cannot assume the role which properly belongs to the chosen representatives of the people in <ORG> particularly when Judges have no divining rod to divine accurately the will of the people There is no risk involved in entrusting a wide discretion to <ORG> and <ORG> in granting anticipatory bail because firstly these are higher courts manned by experienced persons secondly their orders are not final but are open to appellate or revisional scrutiny and above all because discretion has always to be exercised by courts judicially and not according to whim caprice or fancy On the other hand there is a risk in foreclosing categories of cases in which anticipatory bail may be allowed because life throws up unforeseen possibilities and offers new challenges Now it seems to me that when the Act is so express to provide a wide discretion it is not advisable to lay down any rigid rules for guiding that discretion The statutory aggravating circumstances the existence of any of which may justify the imposition of the extreme penalty of death as provided in that statute are The offence of murder rape armed robbery or kidnapping was committed by a person with a prior record of conviction for a capital felony or the offence of murder was committed by a person who has a substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions The offence of murder rape armed robbery or kidnapping was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony or aggravated battery or the offence of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of burglary or arson in the first degree The offence of murder was committed by a person in or who has escaped from the lawful custody of a peace officer or place of lawful confinement It also provides for an automatic appeal of death sentence to <ORG> which may or may not affirm the death sentence The constitutional validity of the amended statutory scheme of Georgia was challenged before <ORG> on the ground that the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of murder under the Georgia statute violated the prohibition against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments Before <ORG> the constitutional validity of the imposition of death penalty for the crime of murder under the Florida statutes was challenged on the same ground as in <NAME> Georgia This was if we may say so with respect an admission of the fact that a considerable range of sentencing discretion has perforce to be left with the sentencing body to be exercised by it according to its own good sense and reason and that no standards howsoever meticulously drafted can totally exclude scope for arbitrary and capricious action It was observed As a general proposition these concerns expressed in Furman are best met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information But this language need not be construed in this way and there is no reason to assume that <ORG> will adopt such an open ended construction <NAME> <NAME> with whom the Chief Justice and <NAME> <NAME> joined negatived the change of these standards being vague and incomplete with these observations The argument is considerably overstated <ORG> has plainly made an effort to guide the jury in the exercise of its discretion while at the same time permitting the jury to dispense mercy on the basis of factors too intangible to write into a statute and I cannot accept the naked assertion that the effort is bound to fail This takes us to the question of indicating the broad criteria which should guide the <ORG> in the matter of sentencing a person convicted of murder under Section Penal Code The only effect is that the application of those principles is now to be guided by the paramount beacons of legislative policy discernible from Sections and namely The extreme penalty can be inflicted only in gravest cases of extreme culpability In making choice of the sentence in addition to the circumstances of the offence due regard must be paid to the circumstances of the offences also We will first notice some of the aggravating circumstances which in the absence of any mitigating circumstances have been regarded as an indication for imposition of the extreme penalty The same principle was substantially reiterated by <NAME> speaking for the Bench in Ediga Anamma in these terms The weapons used and the manner of their use the horrendous features of the crime and hapless helpless state of the victim and the like steel the heart of the law for a sterner sentence It may be noted that this indicator for imposing the death sentence was crystallised in that case after paying due regard to the shift in legislative policy embodied in Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure although on the date of that decision February this provision had not come into force What is the relative weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case i while such member or public servant was on duty or ii in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such member or public servant in the lawful discharge of his duty as such member or public servant whether at the time of murder he was such member or public servant as the case may be or had ceased to be such member or public servant or if the murder is of a person who had acted in the lawful discharge of his duty under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure or who had rendered assistance to a Magistrate or a police officer demanding his aid or requiring his assistance under Section and Section of the said Code But this much can be said that in order to qualify for inclusion in the category of aggravating circumstances which may form the basis of special reasons in Section circumstances found on the facts of a particular case must evidence aggravation of an abnormal or special degree Dr <NAME> has suggested these mitigating factors Mitigating circumstances In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases the <ORG> shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance If the accused is young or old he shall not be sentenced to death The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated The <ORG> shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions and above That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct In several States of India there are in force special enactments according to which a child that is a person who at the date of murder was less than years of age cannot be tried convicted and sentenced to death or imprisonment for life for murder nor dealt with according to the same procedure as an adult But those decisions can no longer be held to be good law in views of the current penological trends and the sentencing policy outlined in Section and There are numerous other circumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence as there are countervailing circumstances of aggravation We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality For all the foregoing reasons we reject the challenge to the constitutionality of the impugned provisions contained in Sections Penal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure BHAGWATI These writ petitions challenge the constitutional validity of Section of the Indian Penal Code read with Section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure in so far as it provides death sentence as an alternative punishment for the offence of murder There are several grounds on which the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided in Section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure is assailed before us but it is not necessary to set them out at this stage for I propose to deal with them when I examine the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties Suffice it to state for the present that I find considerable force in some of these grounds and in my view the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided as an alternative punishment in section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be sustained Before I proceed to consider the various constitutional issues arising out of the challenge to the validity of the death penalty I must deal with a preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents against our competence to entertain this challenge the question of constitutional validity of death penalty was raised in <NAME> case supra and this <ORG> by a unanimous judgment held it to be constitutionally valid and therefore ordinarily on the principle of stare decisis we would hold ourselves bound by the view taken in that case and resist any attempt at reconsideration of the same issue But there are several weighty considerations which compel us to depart from this precedential rule in the present case It may be pointed out that the rule of adherence to precedence is not a rigid and inflexible rule of law but it is a rule of practice adopted by the courts for the purpose of ensuring uniformity and stability in the law There are certain issues which transcend technical considerations of stare decisis and if such an issue is brought before the court it would be nothing short of abdication of its constitutional duty for the court to consider such issue by taking refuge under the doctrine of stare decisis Moreover in the present case there are two other supervening circumstances which justify nay compel reconsideration of the decision in <NAME> case supra I shall presently refer to this section enacted in the new Code of Criminal Procedure and show how in view of that provision the imposition of death penalty has become still more indefensible from the constitutional point of view We cannot therefore consider ourselves bound by the view taken in <NAME> case supra and I must proceed to consider the issue as regards the constitutional validity of death penalty afresh without being in any manner inhibited by the decision in <NAME> case supra there is power of judicial review there has been judicial disagreement on the constitutionality of death penalty There is no reason why in adjudicating upon the constitutional validity of death penalty Non lawyers have not reached unanimity on the answers to the problems posed nor will they ever do so But when judges are confronted by issues to which there is no legal answer there is no reason other than a desire to maintain a fiction that the law provides the answer for judicial discretion to be exercised in a vacuum immune from non legal learning and extra legal dispute With these prefatory observations I shall now proceed to consider the question of constitutional validity of death penalty I shall presently refer to the constitutional provisions which bear on the question of constitutionality of death penalty but before I do so it would be more logical if I first examine what is the international trend of opinion in regard to death penalty There are quite a large number of countries which have abolished death penalty de jure or in any event de facto The Addendum to the Report of the Amnesty International on The Death Penalty points out that as on th May the following countries have abolished death penalty for all offences Australia Brazil Colombia Costa Rica Denmark Dominican Republic Ecuador Fiji Finland Federal Republic of Germany Honduras Iceland Luxembourg Norway Portugal Sweden Uruguay and Venezuela and according to this Report Canada Italy Malta Netherlands Panama Peru Spain and Switzerland have abolished death penalty in time of peace but retained it for specific offences committed in time of war It may be pointed out that an attempt was made in the United Kingdom in December to reintroduce death penalty for terrorist offences involving murder but it was defeated in <ORG> and once again a similar motion moved by a conservative member of <ORG> that the sentence of capital punishment should again be available to the courts was defeated in <ORG> in a free vote on th July It will thus be seen that there is a definite trend in most of the countries of Europe and America towards abolition of death penalty It is significant to note that <ORG> has also taken great interest in the abolition of capital punishment No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women So deep and profound was <ORG> concern with the issue of death penalty that <ORG> in its resolotion XIV of November invited <ORG> to initiate study of the question of capital punishment of the laws and practices relating thereto and of the effects of capital punishment and the abolition thereof on the rate of criminality By this Resolution <ORG> urged member governments inter alia to keep under review the efficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime in their countries and to conduct research into the subject and to remove this punishment from the criminal law concerning any crime to which it is in fact not applied or to which there is no intention to apply it This Resolution clearly shows that there was no evidence supporting the supposed deterrent effect of the death penalty and that is why <ORG> suggested further research on the topic This Report contained a finding that most countries are gradually restricting the number of offences for which the death penalty is to be applied and a few have totally abolished capital offences even in war times This latter resolution clearly affirmed that In order to guarantee fully the right to life provided for in article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the main objective to be pursued is that of progressively restricting the number of offences for which capital punishment may be imposed with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment in all countries I will now proceed to consider the relevant provisions of the Constitution bearing on the question of constitutional validity of death penalty It is not a mere pedantic legal text but it embodies certain human values cherished principles and spiritual norms and recognises and upholds the dignity of man The Preamble makes it clear that the Constitution is intended to secure to every citizen social economic and political justice and equality of status and opportunity and to promote fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual But all these provisions enacted for the purpose of ensuring the dignity of the individual and providing for his material moral and spiritual development would be Meaningless and ineffectual unless there is rule of law to invest them with life and force Now if we look at the various constitutional provisions including the Chapters on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy it is clear that the rule of law permeates the entire fabric of the Constitution and indeed forms one of its basic features Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of the rule of law Law in the context of the rule of law does not mean any law enacted by the legislative authority howsoever arbitrary or despotic it may be Otherwise even under a dictatorship it would be possible to say that there is rule of law because every law made by the dictator howsoever arbitrary and unreasonable has to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in conformity with such law In such a case too even where the political set up is dictatorial it is law that governs the relationship between men and men and between men and the <ORG> What is necessary element of the rule of law is that the law must not be arbitrary or irrational and it must satisfy the test of reason and the democratic form of polity seeks to ensure this element by making the framers of the law accountable to the people One belongs to the rule of law while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch There tenders were invited by <ORG> for giving a contract for running a canteen at the Bombay Airport One was a person who had considerable experience in the catering business but he was not a registered nd class hotelier as required by the condition in the invitation to tender The contract given to him was challenged and the court held that the action of <ORG> was illegal Now a law may contravene Article because it enacts provisions which are arbitrary as for example they make discriminatory classification which is not founded on intelligible differentia having rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law or they arbitrarily select persons or things for discriminatory treatment But there is also another category of cases where without enactment of specific provisions which are arbitrary a law may still offend Article because it confers discretion on an authority to select persons or things for application of the law without laying down any policy or principle to guide the exercise of such discretion <NAME> <NAME> has frankly pointed this out in his lectures on Nature of the Judicial Process There has been a certain lack of candor in much of the discussion of the theme or rather perhaps in the refusal to discuss it as if judges must lose respect and confidence by the reminder that they are subject to human limitations if there is anything of reality in my analysis of the judicial process they do not stand aloof on these chill and distant heights and we shall not help the cause of truth by acting and speaking as if they do It may therefore be said that the most important thing about a judge is his philosophy and if it be dangerous for him to have one it is at all events less dangerous than the self deception of having none Sub clauses a to of clause of Article enact various Fundamental freedoms sub clause guarantees freedom of speech and expression sub clause freedom to assemble peacefully and without arms sub clause freedom to form associations or unions sub clause freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India sub clause to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and sub clause freedom to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business There was originally sub clause in clause of Article which guaranteed freedom to acquire hold and dispose of property but that sub clause was deleted by the Constitution Forty Fourth Amendment Act Now the freedoms guaranteed under these various sub clauses of clause of Article are not absolute freedoms but they can be restricted by law provided such law satisfies the requirement of the applicable provision in one or the other of clauses to of that Article The common basic requirement of the saving provision enacted in clauses to of Article is that the restriction imposed by the law must be reasonable If therefore any law is enacted by the legislature which violates one or the other provision of clauses of Article it would not be protected by the saving provision enacted in clauses to of that Article if it is arbitrary or irrational because in that event the restriction imposed by it would a fortiorari be unreasonable No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law Two questions arose before the <ORG> in that case one was as to what is the content of the expression personal liberty and the other was as to what is the meaning of the expression except according to procedure established by law We are not concerned here with the first question and hence I shall not dwell upon it It was intended to be no more than a protection against executive action which had no authority of law If there was a law which provided some sort of procedure it was enough to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty But in <NAME> case supra which marks a watershed in the history of development of constitutional law in our country this <ORG> for the first time took the view that Article affords protection not only against executive action but also against legislation and any law which deprives a person of his life or personal liberty would be invalid unless it prescribes a procedure for such deprivation which is reasonable fair and just If therefore a law is enacted by the legislature which deprives a person of the life and life according to the decision of this Court in <NAME> Administrator Union Territory of Delhi and Ors would include not merely physical existence but also the use of any faculty or limb as also the right to live with human dignity or any aspect of his personal liberty it would offend against Article if the procedure prescribed for such deprivation is arbitrary and unreasonable If a person is preventively detained on a ground other than those set out in the law the preventive detention would obviously not be according to the procedure prescribed by the law because the procedure set out in the law for preventively detaining a person prescribes certain specific grounds on which alone a person can be preventively detained and if he is detained on any other ground it would be violative of Article Every facet of the law which deprives a person of his life or personal liberty would therefore have to stand the test of reasonableness fairness and justness in order to be outside the inhibition of Article Article provides inter alia that no one shall be deprived of his life except according to procedure established by law and this clearly postulates that a person may be deprived of his life in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law or in other words law may provide a procedure which of course according to the decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra must be reasonable fair and just procedure for inflicting death penalty on a person depriving him of his life Clause of Article also recognises the possibility of a sentence of death being imposed on a person convicted of an offence inasmuch as it provides that the President shall have the power to suspend remit or commute the sentence of any person who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to death The Constitution is not a transient document but it is meant to endure for a long time to come and during its life situations may arise where death penalty may be found to serve a social purpose and its prescription may not be liable to be regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable and therefore to meet such situations the Constitution had to make a provision and this it did in Article and clause of Article so that even where death penalty is prescribed by any law and it is otherwise not unconstitutional it must still comply with the requirement of Article and it would be subject to the clemency power of the President under clause of Article This question has to be answered in the present case with reference to section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Now in order to answer this question it is necessary first of all to examine the legislative trend in our country so far as the imposition of death penalty is concerned This provision laid down that if an accused was convicted of an offence punishable with death the imposition of death sentence was the rule and the awarding of a lesser sentence was an exception and the court had to state the reasons for not passing the sentence of death But by the Amending Act of which came into force with effect from st January this provision was deleted with the result that from and after that date it was left to the discretion of the court on the facts of each case to pass a sen SCC Where the court found in a given case that on the facts and circumstances of the case the death sentence was not called for or there were extenuating circumstances to justify the passing of the lesser sentence the court would award the lesser sentence and not impose the death penalty But then again there was a further shift against death penalty by reason of the abolitionist pressure and when the new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted section sub section provided When the conviction is for a sentence punishable with death or in the alternative with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years the judgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded and in the case of sentence of death special reasons for such sentence The court is now required under this provision to state the reasons for the sentence awarded and in case of sentence of death special reasons are required to be stated It will thus be seen that life sentence is now the rule and it is only in exceptional cases for special reasons that death sentence can be imposed Otherwise perhaps the charge against the present section of of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure that it does not indicate any policy or principle to guide the exercise of judicial discretion in awarding death penalty would have been considerably diluted though even then I doubt very much whether that section could have survived the attack against its constitutionally on the ground that it still leaves the door open for arbitrary exercise of discretion in imposing death penalty But I have no doubt that a humane treatment even of a murderer will enhance man dignity and make society more human Today there is a movement afoot for the abolition of capital punishment and attempts are being made to convert prisons into hospitals as if they are persons suffering from a disease There is also the recent instance of surrender of <NAME> a notorious dacoit of Madhya Pradesh It is argued on behalf of the retentionists that having regard to the elaborate procedural safeguards enacted by the law in cases involving capital punishment the possibility of mistake is more imaginary than real and these procedural safeguards virtually make conviction of an innocent person impossible <NAME> in his well known book The Death Penalty in America has individually documented seventy four cases since in which it has been responsibly charged and in most of them proved beyond doubt that persons were wrongly convicted of criminal homicide in America Our convictions are based largely on oral evidence of witnesses Then there is also the possibility of a frame up of innocent men by their enemies There are also cases where an over zealous prosecutor may fail to disclose evidence of innocence known to him but not known to the defence Then again it is sometimes argued that on this reasoning every criminal trial must necessarily raise the possibility of wrongful conviction and if that be so are we going to invalidate every form of punishment But this argument I am afraid is an argument of despair There is a qualitative difference between death penalty and other forms of punishment I think there is a difference not merely in quantity but also in quality This is the drastic nature of death penalty terrifying in its consequences which has to be taken into account in determining in constitutional validity There are times when the neck has not been broken and the prisoner strangles to death I am leaving aside for the moment challenge to death penalty under Article and confining myself only to the challenge under Article and So far as this challenge is concerned the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner contended that the imposition of death penalty under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure was arbitrary and unreasonable firstly because it was cruel and inhuman disproportionate and excessive secondly because it was totally unnecessary and did not serve any social purpose or advance any constitutional value and lastly because the discretion conferred on the court to award death penalty was not guided by any policy or principle laid down by the legislature but was wholly arbitrary <ORG> as also the States supporting it sought to counter this argu ment of the petitioners by submitting first that death penalty is neither cruel nor inhuman neither disproportionate nor excessive secondly that it does serve a social purpose inasmuch as it fulfils two penological goals namely denunciation by the community and deterrence and lastly that the judicial discretion in awarding death penalty is not arbitrary and the court can always evolve standards or norms for the purpose of guiding the exercise of its discretion in this punitive area These were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and I shall now proceed to examine them in the light of the observations made in the preceding paragraphs The first question that arises for consideration on these contentions is and that is a vital question which may well determine the fate of this challenge to the constitutional validity of death penalty on whom does the burden of proof lie in a case like this Does it lie on the petitioners to show that death penalty is arbitrary and unreasonable on the various grounds urged by them or does it rest on the <ORG> to show that death penalty is not arbitrary or unreasonable and serves a legitimate social purpose If the <ORG> fails to discharge this burden there is no obligation on the petitioner to prove negatively that the impugned law is not covered by any of the permissive clauses and that it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds These observations of <NAME> <NAME> undoubtedly seem to support the contention of the respondents but it may be pointed out that what was said by this <ORG> in the passage quoted above from the judgment in <NAME> case supra on which reliance was placed by <NAME> <NAME> was only with reference to the challenge under Article and the <ORG> was not considering there the challenge under Articles or This statement of the law contained in <NAME> case supra could not therefore be applied straightaway without anything more in a case where a law was challenged under Articles or The fact however remains that <NAME> <NAME> relied on this statement of the law even though the case before him involved a challenge under Article and not under Article Unfortunately it seems that the attention of the learned Judge was not invited to the decisions of this <ORG> in <NAME> case and <ORG> case SCR supra which were cases directly involving challenge under Article These decisions were binding on the learned Judge and if his attention had been drawn to them I am sure that he would not have made the observations that he did casting on the petitioners the onus of establishing excessiveness or perversity in the restrictions imposed by the statute in a case alleging violation of Article There the constitutional validity of the Kerala Agriculturists Debt Relief Act was challenged on the ground of violation of both Articles and observed that the court will interfere with a statute only when the statute is clearly violative of the right conferred on the citizen under Part III of the Constitution and proceeded to add that it is on account of this reason that courts have recognised that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the onus to prove its invalidity lies on the party which assails the same The <ORG> it is accepted must presume that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case supra relied upon by <NAME> <NAME> occurs in the discussion relating to the challenge under Article and obviously it was not intended to have any application in a case involving challenge under Article or In fact while discussing the challenge to the prevention of cow slaughter statutes under Article <NAME> <NAME> proceeded to consider whether the restrictions imposed by the impugned statutes on the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners under Article were reasonable in the interest of the general public so as to be saved by clause of Article What the learned Judge said was that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the court will not interfere unless the statute is clearly violative of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution There must obviously be a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and initially it would be for the petitioners to show that it violates a Fundamental Right conferred under one or the other sub clauses of clause of Article and is therefore unconstitutional but when that is done the question arises on whom does the burden of showing whether the restrictions are permissible or not lie That was not a question dealt with by <NAME> <NAME> and I cannot therefore read the observations of the learned Judge as in any manner casting doubt on the validity of the statement of law contained in <NAME> <ORG> cases supra Obviously therefore when a law is challenged on the ground that it imposes restrictions on the freedom guaranteed by one or the other subclause of clause of Article and the restrictions are shown to exist by the petitioner the burden of establishing that the restrictions fall within any of the permissive clauses to which may be applicable must rest upon the <ORG> The <ORG> would have to produce material for satisfying the court that the restrictions imposed by the impugned law fall within the appropriate permissive clause from out of clauses to of Article Of course there may be cases where the nature of the legislation and the restrictions imposed by it may be such that the court may without more even in the absence of any positive material produced by the <ORG> conclude that the restrictions fall within the permissible category as for example where a law is enacted by the legislature for giving effect to one of the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy and prima facie the restrictions imposed by it do not appear to be arbitrary or excessive But once it is shown by the petitioner that the impugned law imposes restrictions which infringe one or the other sub clause of clause of Article the burden of showing that such restrictions are reasonable and fall within the permissible category must be on the <ORG> and this burden the <ORG> may discharge either by producing socio economic data before the court or on consideration of the provisions in the impugned law read in the light of the constitutional goals set out in the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy Before I proceed to consider the question of burden of proof in case of challenge under Article it would be convenient first to SCR deal with the question as to where does the burden of proof lie when the challenge to a law enacted by the legislature is based on violation of Article Where therefore a law authorises deprivation of the right to life the reasonableness fairness and justness of the procedure prescribed by it for such deprivation must be established by the <ORG> It is significant to point out that even in case of <ORG> action depriving a person of his personal liberty this Court has always cast the burden of proving the validity of such action on the <ORG> when it has been challenged on behalf of the person deprived of his personal liberty It has been consistently held by this Court that when detention of a person is challenged in a habeas corpus petition the burden of proving the legality of the detention always rests on the <ORG> and it is for the <ORG> to justify the legality of the detention The <ORG> must place the necessary material on record for the purpose of discharging this burden which lies upon it and if it fails to show by presenting adequate evidence before the court or otherwise that death penalty is not arbitrary and unreasonable and does serve a legitimate social purpose the imposition of death penalty under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure would have to be struck down as violative of the protection of Article So far as the question of burden of proof in a case involving challenge under Article is concerned I must concede that the decisions in <NAME> case supra and <NAME> case supra and several other subsequent decisions of the <ORG> have clearly laid down that there is a presumption in favour of constitutionality of a statute and the burden of showing that it is arbitrary or discriminary lies upon the petitioner because it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds The learned Judge with a belief firmly rooted in the tenets of mechanical jurisprudence has taken the view that the primary function of the <ORG> is to interpret and apply the laws according to the will of those who made them and not to transgress into the legislative domain of policy making However I agree with <NAME> that ordinarily the judicial function must be characterised by deference to legislative judgment because the legislature represents the voice of the people and it might be dangerous for the court to trespass into the sphere demarcated by the Constitution for the legislature unless the legislative judgment suffers from a constitutional infirmity There may conceivably be cases where having regard to the nature and character of the legislation the importance of the right affected and the gravity the injury caused by it and the moral and social issues involved in the determination the court may refuse to proceed on the basis of presumption of constitutionality and demand from the <ORG> justification of the legislation with a view to establishing that it is not arbitrary or discriminatory There are times when commitment to the values of the Constitution and performance of the constitutional role as guardian of fundamental rights demands dismissal of the usual judicial deference to legislative judgment The same reasons which have weighed with me in holding that the burden must lie on the <ORG> to prove that the death penalty provided under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not arbitrary and unreasonable and serves a legitimate penological purpose where the challenge is under Article must apply equally to cast the burden of the proof upon the <ORG> where the challenge is under Article That is because there are social and moral considerations that enter into the scope and application of section There was a time when in the United Kingdom a sentence of death for the offence of theft or shop lifting was regarded as proportionate to the offence and therefore quite legitimate and reasonable according to the standards of human decency then prevailing but today such punishment would be regarded as totally disproportionate to the offence and hence arbitrary and unreasonable I fail to appreciate how it should make any difference to the penalty whether the murder is a simple murder or a brutal one I agree with these observations of the learned Judge which clearly show that death penalty cannot be regarded as proportionate to the offence of murder merely because the murder is brutal heinous or shocking It is for reasons which I shall presently state wholly untenable and it has dangerous implications If it cannot be justified with reference to one or the other of these three penological purposes it would have to be condemned as arbitrary and irrational for in a civilised society governed by the rule of law no punishment can be inflicted on an individual unless it serves some social purpose It is a condition of legality of a punishment that it should serve a rational legislative purpose or in other words it should have a measurable social effect But the answer given by the protagonists of death penalty to this argument is that though there may be a few murderers whom it may be possible to reform and rehabilitate what about those killers who cannot be reformed and rehabilitated Why should the death penalty be not awarded to them But even in their cases I am afraid the argument cannot be sustained There is no way of accurately predicting or knowing with any degree of moral certainty that a murderer will not be reformed or is incapable of reformation Therefore once the dross of Tamas is removed and satva is brought forth by methods of rehabilitation such as community service yoga meditation and sat sang or holy influence a change definitely takes place and the man is reformed I would not therefore speaking for myself be inclined to recognise any exception though Justice <NAME> has done so in <NAME> case that death panalty may be legally permissible where it is found that a killer is such a monster or beast that he can never be reformed The ultimate justification of any punishment is not that it is a deterrent but that it is the emphatic denunciation by the community of a crime and from this point of view there are some murders which in the present state of opinion demand the most emphatic denunciation of all namely the death penalty <NAME> wrote He who desires to inflict rational punishment does not retaliate for a past wrong which cannot be undone he has regard to the future and is desirous that the man who is punished and he who sees him punished may be deterred from doing wrong again There is no place in the scheme for punishment for its own sake the product simply of vengeance or retribution It is true that when a heinous offence is committed not only the individual who suffers as a result of the crime but the entire society is oppressed with a feeling of revulsion but as <NAME> has put it in his inimitable style in his Reflections on Hanging Though easy to dismiss in reasoned argument on both moral and logical grounds the desire for vengeance has deep unconscious roots and is roused when we feel strong indignation or revulsion whether the reasoning mind approves or not This psychological fact is largely ignored in abolitionist propaganda yet it has to be accepted as a fact I have no doubt in my mind that if the only justification for the death penalty is to be found in revenge and retaliation it would be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable punishment falling foul of Articles and I have already given my reasons for taking this view on principle but I find that the same view has also been taken by <ORG> in Commonwealth <NAME> No where it has been held that because death penalty impinges on the right to life itself the onus lies on the <ORG> to show a compelling <ORG> interest to justify capital punishment and since in that case the <ORG> was unable to satisfy this onus the <ORG> ruled that death penalty for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape was unconstitutional If the <ORG> fails to discharge this burden which rests upon it the <ORG> would have to hold that death penalty has not been shown to have greater deterrent effect and it does not therefore serve a rational legislative purpose The argument that the rate of homicide will increase if death penalty is removed from the statute book has always been advanced by the established order out of fear psychosis because the established order has always been apprehensive that if there is any change and death penalty is abolished its existence would be imperilled This argument has in my opinion no validity because beyond a superstitious belief for which there is no foundation in fact and which is based solely on unreason and fear there is nothing at all to show that death penalty has any additionally deterrent effect not possessed by life sentence Statistics compiled during the last years in England show that out of men hanged had previously attended one or even two public executions and yet they were not deterred from committing the offence of murder which ultimately led to their conviction and hanging Even an eminent judge like Justice <NAME> of <ORG> of the United States expressed the same opinion when he said in the course of his examination before <ORG> I think scientifically the claim of deterrence is not worth much and then again it observed in support of this conclusion The general conclusion which we have reached is that there is no clear evidence in any of the figures we have examined that the abolition of capital punishment has led to an increasing homicide rate or that its reintroduction has led to a fall Professor <NAME> points out that the only conclusion which can be drawn from these figures is that there is no clear evidence After examining statistics from states Professor <NAME> concluded that there is no evidence that the abolition of capital punishment generally causes an increase in criminal homicides or that its reintroduction is followed by a decline It was found that there were significantly more homicides in the period after the executions than before the opposite of what the deterrence theory would suggest other studies have also shown that in those localities where capital punishment is carried out the incidence of homicide does not show any decline in the period immediately following well publicized executions when if death penalty had any special deterrent effect such effect would be greatest In short there is no correlation between the ups and downs of the homicide rate on the one hand and the presence or absence of the death penalty on the other I do not wish to burden this judgment with reference to all the studies which have been conducted at different times in different parts of the world but I may refer to a few of them namely Capital Punishment as a Deterrent to Crime in Georgia by <NAME> The Death Penalty in Washington State by <NAME> and Crannor Report of the Massachusett Special Commission Relative to the Abolition of the Death Penalty in Capital Cases The use of the Death Penalty Factual Statement by <NAME> Why was Capital Punishment resorted in Delaware by <NAME> A Study in Capital Punishment by <NAME> The Deterrent Influence of the Death Penalty by <NAME> Murder and the Death Penalty by <NAME> Capital Punishment A case for Abolition by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Can the Death Penalty Prevent Crime by <NAME> and Findings on Deterrence with Regard to Homicide by <NAME> and <NAME> These various studies to which I have referred clearly establish beyond doubt that death penalty does not have any special deterrent effect which life sentence does not posses and that in any event there is no evidence at all to suggest that death penalty has any such special deterrent effect They raised questions about his failure to consider the feedback effect of crime on the economic variables in his model although he did consider other feedback effects in his analysis They too raised questions about variables omitted from the analysis and the effects of these omissions on the findings So also in another part of the world very close to our country <ORG> on capital punishment was appointed by late Prime Minister <NAME> of Shri Lanka and it reported If the experience of the many countries which have suspended or abolished capital punishment is taken into account there is in our view cogent evidence of the unlikelihood of this hidden protection It is therefore our view that the statistics of homicide in Ceylon when related to the social changes since the suspension of the death penalty in Ceylon and when related to the experience of other countries tend to disprove the assumption of the uniquely deterrent effect of the death penalty and that in deciding on the question of reintroduction or abolition of the capital punishment reintroduction cannot be justified on the argument that it is a more effective deterrent to potential killers than the alternative or protracted imprisonment They argue that there are potential murderers in our midst who would be deterred from killing by the death penalty but would not be deterred by life imprisonment and there is no possible way of knowing about them since these persons do not commit murder and hence are not identified There is no doubt that if death penalty has a special deterrent effect not possessed by life imprisonment the number of those deterred by capital punishment would appear statistically in the homicide rates of abolitionist jurisdictions but according to all the evidence gathered by different studies made by jurists and criminologists this is just not to be found That is the same argument advanced by Sir <NAME> the draftsman of the Indian Penal Code in support of the deterrent effect of capital punishment The threat of instant death is the one to which resort has always been made when there was an absolute necessity of producing some results No one goes to certain inevitable death except by compulsion Secondly there is a great fallacy underlying the argument of Sir <NAME> and <ORG> Since both the penalties for murder death as well as life sentence are so severe as to destroy the future of any one subjected to them the crime would not be committed by a rational man unless he thinks that there is little chance of detection <ORG> appointed by <ORG> stated in its report in We were impressed by the argument that the greatest deterrent to crime is not the fear of punishment but the certainty Of detection It is interesting to note that in the last years almost every case where death penalty is confirmed by <ORG> has come up before this Court by way of petition for special leave and barring the case of <NAME> and <NAME> I do not think there is a single case in which death penalty has been affirmed by this Court It will thus be seen that during the period of five years from to there was an infinitesingly small number of cases only out of an aggregate number of approximately cases of murder in which death sentence was executed It is obvious therefore that even after conviction in a trial there is high degree of probability that death sentence may not be imposed by the sessions court and even If death sentence is imposed by the sessions court it may not be confirmed by <ORG> and even after confirmation by <ORG> it may not be affirmed by this Court and lastly even if affirmed by this Court it may be commuted by the President of India under Article or by the Governor under Article of the Constitution in exercise of the power of clemency But I do not think any reliance can be placed on the observations in these decisions in support of the view that death penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect The learned Judges who made these observations did not have any socio legal data before them on the basis of which they could logically come to the conclusion that death penalty serves as a deterrent It is true that in <NAME> case supra <NAME> speaking on behalf of the court did take the view that death penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect but I do Dot think that beyond a mere traditional belief the validity of which cannot be demonstrated either by logic or by reason there is any cogent and valid argument put forward by the learned Judge in support of the view that death sentence has greater deterrent effect than life sentence <NAME> has also in <NAME> case supra taken the view that there is no positive indication that the death penalty has been deterrent or in other words the efficacy of the death penalty as a deterrent is unproven Then reliance has been placed by <NAME> <NAME> speaking on behalf of the majority on the observations of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> supra where the learned <NAME>udge took the view that death penalty serves a deterrent as well as retributive purpose It cannot be accepted merely because it is the view of an eminent judge I find that as against the view taken by him there is a contrary view taken by at least two judges of <ORG> namely The <ORG> must always remember that it is charged by the Constitution to act as a sentinel on the qui vive guarding the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and it cannot shirk its responsibility by observing that since there are strong divergent views on the subject the court need not express any categorical opinion one way or the other as to which of these two views is correct But even if we proceed on the hypothesis that the opinion in regard to the deterrent effect of death penalty is divided and it is not possible to say which opinion is right and which opinion is wrong it is obvious that in this state of affairs it cannot be said to be proved that death penalty has an additional deterrent effect not possessed by life sentence and if that be so the legislative provision for imposition of death penalty as alternative punishment for murder fail since as already pointed out above the burden of showing that death penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect and therefore serves a penological goal is on the State and if the State fails to discharge this burden which lies upon it death penalty as alternative punishment for murder must be held to be arbitrary and unreasonable The statement made in clause is perfectly correct and I agree with <ORG> that death as a penalty stands on a totally different level from life imprisonment and the difference between them is one of quality and not merely of degree but I fail to see how from this circumstance an inference can necessarily follow that death penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect There are quite a number of people in this country who still nurture the superstitions and irrational belief ingrained in their minds by a century old practice of imposition of capital punishment and fostered though not consciously by the instinct for retribution that death penalty alone can act as an effective deterrent against the crime of murder I have already demonstrated how this belief entertained by lawyers judges legislators and police officers is a myth and it has no basis in logic or reason Then there are the arguments in clauses and but these arguments even according to <ORG> itself are inconclusive and it is difficult to see how they can be relied upon to support the thesis that capital punishment acts as a deterrent I have already dealt with this argument and shown that the statistical studies carried out by various jurists and criminologists clearly disclose That there is no evidence at all to suggest that death penalty acts as a deterrent and it must therefore be held on the basis of the available material that death penalty does not act as a deterrent There was also one other argument put forward by <ORG> in its th Report and that argument was that having regard to the conditions in India to the variety of social up bringing of its inhabitants to the disparity in the level of morality and education in the country to the vastness of its area to the diversity of its population and to the paramount Deed to maintain law and order in the country at the present juncture India cannot risk the experiment of abolition of capital punishment I cannot subscribe to the opinion that because the social upbringing of the people varies from place to place or from class to class or there are demographic diversities and variations they tend to increase the incidence of homicide and even if they do I fail to see how death penalty can counter act the effect of these factors There is in fact statistical evidence to show that the attenuation of the area in which death penalty may be imposed and the remoteness and infrequency of abolition of death penalty have not resulted in increase in the rate of homicide The figures which were placed before us on behalf of the <ORG> clearly show that there was no increase in the rate of homicide even though death sentence was made awardable only in exceptional cases under section sub section of the new Code of Criminal Procedure It will thus be seen that death penalty as provided under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not subserve any legitimate end of punishment since by killing the murderer it totally rejects the reformative purpose and it has no additional deterrent effect which life sentence does not possess and it is therefore not justified by the deterrence theory of punishment It must therefore be held that death penalty has no rational nexus with any legitimate penological goal or any rational penological purpose and it is arbitrary and irrational and hence violative of Articles and of the Constitution It is obvious on a plain reading of section of the Indian Penal Code which provides death penalty as alternative punishment for murder that it leaves it entirely to the discretion of <ORG> whether to impose death sentence or to award only life imprisonment to an accused convicted of the offence of murder What may appear as special reasons to one judge may not so appear to another and the decision in a given case whether to impose the death sentence or to let off the offender only with life imprisonment would to a large extent depend upon who is the judge called upon to make the decision There is nothing like complete objectivity in the decision making process and especially so when this process involves making of decision in the exercise of judicial discretion There is in each of us a stream of tendency whether you choose to call it philosophy or not which gives coherence and direction to thought and action <NAME> says in his book Law and the Modern Mind in an observation with which I find myself in entire agreement Without acquired slants preconceptions life could not go on are dedicated souls totally different from ordinary criminals as they are motivated not by any self interest but by a burning desire to bring about a revolution by eliminating vested interests and should not therefore be put out of corporeal existence while another Judge may take the view that the Naxalities being guilty of cold premeditated murders are a menace to the society and to innocent men and women and therefore deserve to be liquidated Even in <ORG> there are divergent attitudes and opinions in regard to the imposition of capital punishment The former would find and I say this not in any derogatory or disparaging sense but as a consequence of psychological and attitudinal factors operating on the minds of the Judges constituting the Bench special reasons in the case to justify award of death penalty while the latter would reject any such reasons as special reasons It is also quite possible that one Bench may having regard to its perceptions think that there are special reasons in the case for which death penalty should be awarded while another Bench may bonafide and conscientiously take a different view and hold that there are no special reasons and that only life sentence should be imposed and it may not be possible to assert objectively and logically as to who is right and who is wrong because the exercise of discretion in a case of this kind where no broad standards or guidelines are supplied by the legislature is bound to be influenced by the subjective attitude and approach of the Judges constituting the Bench their value system individual tone of their mind the colour of their experience and the character and variety of their interests and their predispositions <NAME> case was wrong and that is why he referred that case to the Constitution Bench Each of these three persons preferred a separate petition in <ORG> for special leave to appeal against the common judgment sentencing them all to death penalty Then came the special leave petition preferred by <NAME> from jail and this petition was placed for hearing before another bench consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and myself We granted leave to <NAME> limited to the question of sentence and by an order dated th April we allowed his appeal and commuted his sentence of death into one of imprisonment for life The result was that while <NAME> death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by one Bench the death sentence imposed on <NAME> was confirmed by another bench and he was executed on th October though both had played equal part in the murder of the family and there was nothing to distinguish the case of one from that of the other Now since his special leave petition as also his review petition were dismissed by this Court <NAME> would have been executed on th October along with <NAME> but fortunately for him he filed a writ petition in this Court and on that writ petition the court passed an order staying the execution of his death sentence When this writ petition came up for hearing before a still another bench consisting of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and AN it was pointed out to the court that the death sentence imposed on <NAME> had been commuted by a bench consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and myself and when this fact was pointed out the Bench directed that the case be sent back to the President for reconsideration of the clemency petition filed by <NAME> This is a classic case which illustrates the judicial vagaries in the imposition Of death penalty and demonstrates vividly in all its cruel and stark reality how the infliction of death penalty is influenced by the composition of the bench even in cases governed by section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Of course I may make it clear that when I say this I do not wish to suggest that if broad standards or guidelines are supplied by the legislature they would necessarily cure death penalty of the vice of arbitrariness or freakishness He has classified cases upto in terms of the reasons given by the court for awarding or refusing to award death sentence i one of the reasons given by the courts in a number of cases for imposing death penalty is that the murder is brutal cold blooded deliberate unprovoked fatal gruesome wicked callous heinous or violent In fact there are numerous cases where despite the murder being one falling within these categories the court has refused to award death sentence But there are equally a large number of cases whether death sentence has not been awarded because the criminal liability of the accused was only and <NAME> State of where <ORG> took the view that youth is no ground for extenuation of sentence Moreover there is also divergence of opinion as to what should be the age at which an offender may be regarded as a young man deserving i of commutation iv one other mitigating factor which is often taken into account is delay in final sentencing But equally there are a large number of cases where death sentences have been confirmed even when two or more years were taken in finally disposing of the appeal Vide <NAME> State of <NAME> State of Bombay and other cases given by Dr <NAME> in foot note to chapter III These decided cases show that there is no way of predicting But despite this attempt made in <NAME> case to evolve some broad standards or guidelines for imposition of death penalty the subsequent decisions as pointed out by Professor <NAME> display the same pattern of confusion contradictions and aberrations as the decisions before that case The learned author has taken reported decisions given after <NAME> case and shown that it is not possible to discern any coherent pattern in these decisions and they reveal con tradictions and inconsistencies in the matter of imposition of death penalty I may point out that <NAME> has also come to the the same conclusion on the basis of his long experience of the sentencing process He has analysed the different factors which have prevailed with the Judges from time to time in awarding or refusing to award death penalty and shown how some factors have weighed A with one Judge some with another some with a third and so on resulting in chaotic arbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty But when it was contended that sentencing discretion is inherent in our legal system and in fact it is desirable because no two cases or criminals are identical and if no discretion is left to the court and sentencing is to be done according to a rigid predetermined formula leaving no room for judicial discretion the sentencing process would cease to be judicial and would de generate into a bed of procrustean cruelty The awesome and fearful discretion whether to kill a man or to let him live is vested in the court and the court is called upon to exercise That is exactly what we mean when we say that the government should be of laws and not of men and it makes no difference in the application of this princi ple whether men belong to the administration or to the judiciary the equality clause of the Constitution obligate that whenever death sentence is imposed it must be a principled sentence a sentence based on some standard or principle and not arbitrary or indignant capital punishment It has been said that a Judge untethered by a text is a dangerous instrument and I may well add that Judge power uncanalised by clear principles may be equally dangerous when the consequence of the exercise of discretion may result in the hanging of a human being It is obvious that if judicial discretion is not guided by any standard or norms it would degenerate into judicial caprice which as is evident from the foregoing discussion has in fact happened and in such a situation unregulated and un principled sentencing discretion in a highly sensitive area involving a question of life and death would clearly be arbitrary and hence violative of the equal protection clause contained in Article It would also militate against Article as interpreted in <NAME> case supra because no procedure for depriving a person of his life can be regarded as reasonable fair and just if it vests uncontrolled and unregulated discretion in the court whether to award death sentence or to inflict only the punishment of life im prisonment Now it is true that there are cases where the court lays down principles and standards for guidance in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it by a statute but that is done by the court only in those cases where the principles or standards are gatherable from the provisions of the statute Where a statute confers discretion upon a court the statute may lay down the broad standards or principles which should guide the court in the exercise of such discretion or such standards or principles may be discovered from the object and purpose of the statute its underlying policy and the scheme of its provisions and some times even from the surrounding circumstances When the court lays down standards or principles which should guide it in the exercise of its discretion the court does not evolve any new standards or principles of its own but merely discovers them from the statute The standards or principles laid down by the court in such a case are not standards or principles created or evolved by the court but they are standards or principles enunciated by the Iegislature in the statute and are merely discovered by the court as a matter of statutory interpretation there is little agreement among penologists and jurists as to what information about the crime and criminal is relevant and what is not relevant for fixing the dose of punishment for a person convicted of a particular offence I am fortified in this view by the decision of <ORG> of the United <ORG>s in <NAME> Georgia supra The remaining four Judges namely <NAME> <NAME> Blackmun <NAME> Powell <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> took the opposite view and upheld the constitutional validity of the death penalty in its entirety It will thus be seen that the view taken by the majority decision in this case was that a law which gives uncontrolled and unguided discretion to the Judge or the jury to choose arbitrarily between death sentence and life imprisonment for a capital offence violates the Eighth Amendment which inhibits cruel and unusual punishment I have already pointed out that though there is no explicit provision in our Constitution prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment this <ORG> has in <NAME> case supra held that immunity against torture or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment is implicit in Article and therefore if any punishment is cruel and unusual it would be violative of basic human dignity which is guaranteed under Article Moreover in <NAME> case supra this court has by a process of judicial interpretation brought in the procedural due process clause of the American Constitution by reading in Article the requirement that the procedure by which a person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty must be reasonable fair and just <NAME> <NAME> was more emphatic and he observed in the same case These guided discretion statutes provided standards typically in the form of specific aggravating and mitigating circumstances that must be taken into account before death sentence can be handed down There is considerable doubt expressed by leading jurists in the United States in regard to correctness of this decision because in their view the guide lines provided by these statutes in the form of specific aggravating and or mitigating circumstances are too broad and too vague to serve as an effective guide to discretion That controversy does not arise here because admittedly neither the Indian Penal Code nor any other provision of law sets out any aggravating or mitigating circumstance or any other considerations which must be taken into account in determining whether death sentence should be awarded or not It is true that there are certain safeguards provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure which are designed to obviate errors in the exercise of judicial discretion in the matter of imposition of death penalty Then there is also a proviso in section which says that when <ORG> on appeal reverses an order of acquittal and convicts the accused and sentences him to death the accused shall have a right to appeal to <ORG> Lastly there is an over riding power conferred on <ORG> under Article to grant in its discretion special leave to appeal to an accused who has been sentenced to death The first requirement that there should be a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence is met by the enactment of section sub section but the second requirement that the sentencing authority should be provided with standards to guide its use of the information is not satisfied and the imposition of death penalty under section of the Indian Penal ode read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure must therefore be held to be arbitrary and capricious and hence violative of Articles and This view taken by me in regard to the constitutional validity of the death penalty under Articles and renders it unnecessary for me to consider the challenge under Article and I do not therefore propose to express any opinion on that question This view proceeded on the assumption that certain articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and where the requirement of an Article dealing with a particular matter in question is satisfied and there is no infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by that Article no recourse can be had to a fundamental right conferred by another Article and furthermore in order to determine which is the fundamental right violated the court must consider the pith and substance of the legislation and ask the question what is the object of the legislature in enacting the legislation what is the subject matter of the legislation and to which fundamental right does it relate But this doctrine of exclusivity of fundamental rights was clearly and unequivocally over ruled in <NAME> case by a majority of <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> alone dissenting and so was the object and form test or pith and substance rule laid down in <NAME> case We are of the view that the theory that the object and form of the <ORG> action determine the extent of pro tection which the aggrieved party may claim is not consistent with the constitutional scheme In our judgment the assumption in <NAME> case that certain articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and in determining whether there is infringement of the individual guaranteed rights the object and the form of the State action alone need be considered and effect of the laws on fundamental rights of the individuals in general will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct Nor can I agree with the majority judgment when it says that it is Article which deals with the right to life and not Article and section of the Indian Penal Code is therefore not required to be tested on the touchstone of any one or more of the clauses of Article It is significant to note that the doctrine of exclusi vity enunciated in <NAME> case led to the property rights under Article and being treated as distinct and different rights traversing separate grounds but this view was over turned in <NAME> case where this <ORG> by a majority held that a law seeking to deprive a person of his property under Article must be a valid law and it must therefore meet the challenge of other fundamental rights including Article The court ruled that even io a law seeks to deprive a person of his property under Article it must still in order to be valid satisfy the requirement of Article read with clause If this be the true position in regard to the inter relation between Article and Article it is difficult to see why a law authorising deprivation of the right to life under Article should not have to meet the test of other fundamental rights including those set out in the different clauses of Article But even if section in so far as it provides for imposition of death penalty as alternative punishment has to meet the challenge of Article the question would still remain whether the direct and inevitable consequence of that provision is to affect any of the rights guaranteed under the Article It is sufficient for me to state that the object and form test or the pith and substance rule has been completely discarded by the decision in <NAME> case and <NAME> case and it is now settled law that in order to locate the fundamental right violated by a statute the court must consider what is the direct and inevitable consequence of the statute The impugned statute may in its direct and inevitable effect invade more than one fundamental right and merely because it satisfies the requirement of one fundamental right it is not freed from the obligation to meet the challenge of another applicable fundamental right These are the reasons for which I made my order dated May declaring the death penalty provided under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure is unconstitutional and void as being violative of Articles and
