Section empowers <ORG> to authorise <ORG>s to levy a fee on agricultural produce purchased or sold within the The market fee which in was paise for every hundred rupees of the aggregate amount for which the notified agricultural produce was purchased or sold was raised to paise in It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that i section which totally prohibits the purchase and sale of any notified agricultural produce outside the market in that area encroaches upon the right of the citizen to carry on trade or business and is repugnant to Article of the Constitution and is therefore void ii levy of market fee under section on transactions effected by the petitioners from their business premises which are located in the notified market area but outside the market proper is per se illegal and unconstitutional as such levy is not correlated to any services rendered to them Dismissing the appeal HELD Having regard to the purpose and object of the legislation the restriction imposed by section of the Act is reasonable restriction within the meaning of Article of the Constitution In order to determine the reasonableness of a restriction the court must have regard to the nature and conditions prevailing in that trade The contention that no liability is cast on the petitioners to pay market fee on transactions of sale and purchase of notified agricultural produce if they carry on such trade from their own premises in the notified area but outside the market in that area proceeds on wrong assumption because firstly in view of the express prohibition contained in Section the petitioners cannot carry on such trade by not resorting to the market proper Secondly establishment of regulated markets for agricultural produce is a service rendered to those who are engaged in the business of purchase and sale of such commodities There is no irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of section and because they are meant to achieve two distinct and separate objects operate on two different planes In <NAME> case there are certain observations which were really not necessary for purposes of that decision and go beyond the occasion and therefore they have no binding authority though they may have a persuasive value The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as part of a common burden while a fee is for payment of a specific benefit or privilege although the special advantage is secondary to the primary motive of regulation in public interest The power of any legislature to levy a fee is conditioned by the fact that it must be by and large a quid pro quo for the services rendered There is no generic difference between a tax and a fee both arc compulsory exactions of money by public authorities Compulsion lies in the fact that payment is enforceable by law against a person inspite of his unwillingness or want of consent A levy in the nature of a fee does not cease to be of that character merely because there is an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it nor is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual service rendered by the authority to each individual who obtains the benefit of the service There is no force in the contention that the increase in the rate of market fee from paise to rupee was illegal on the ground that there was no correlation between the increase in the services rendered The levy of market fee under section of the Act is co related to the purposes mentioned in section that all the monies received by a market committee from tho traders on sale of agricultural produce have The purposes mentioned in section are all purposes which are extremely beneficial to the growers and the traders A In the instant case there was no allegation that expenditure incurred by the Market committee was not authorised by the Act On the plain language of section of the Act the market fee is leviable both on purchase of paddy by a rice miller from a purchaser and also on purchase or sale of rice by a miller to a trader or by a trader to a trader because there is service rendered by market committee at each of the stages There is distinction between the two although paddy is milled into rice by the process of de husking they arc two separate and distinct commercial commodities and have been separately specified as individual agricultural produce in schedule of the Rules This is of course subject to the qualification that such sale or purchase has taken place in the notified market area but outside the market in that area as enjoined by the proviso to There are also certain subsidiary questions raised in these petitions viz It appears that initially in the year the bye laws of all the market committees throughout the State provided for the levy of market fee paisa for every hundred rupees of the aggregate amount for which the notified agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock was purchased or sold Aggrieved by the decision of <ORG> the petitioners applied to this <ORG> for grant of special leave under Art Undaunted by the dismissal of the special leave petitions these petitioners along with others have now filed petitions under Art It appears from the statement of income and expenditure for the years and that the income from the market fee even after its increase from paisa to rupee one is not sufficient to meet the expenditure of <ORG> In support of these petitions three main contentions were raised namely Sub of of the Act which totally prohibits purchase or sale of any notified agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock in a notified market area outside the market in that area encroaches upon the right of citizens to carry on trade or business and is repugnant to Art of the Constitution and is in consequence void The levy of market fee by the market committees under sub of of the Act on transactions of purchase or sale of any notified agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock in the notified market area effected by the petitioners from their business premises therein but located outside the market proper is per se illegal and unconstitutional as such levy of market fee is not correlated to any service rendered to them By sub of <ORG> is empowered to constitute a market committee for every notified area which shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal in notified agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock in the notified area No person shall within a notified area set up establish or use or continue or allow to continued any place for the purchase sale storage weighment curing pressing or processing of any notified agricultural produce or products of livestock or for the purchase or sale of livestock except under and in accordance with the conditions of a licence granted to him by the market committee Nothing in sub section shall apply to a person purchasing notified agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock for his own domestic consumption Section of the Act which provides for the levy of market fee ant as an important bearing reads Levy of fees by the market committees The market committee shall levy fees on any notified agricultural produce livestock or products of live stock purchased or sold in the notified market area at such rate not exceeding one rupee as may be specified in the bye laws for every hundred rupees of the aggregate amount for which the notified agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock is purchased or sold whether for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration i grant in aid of the market committees for the first year after their constitution under this Act ii grant in aid of a deficit market committee for a period not exceeding three years iii grant of loans to the market committees at such rates of interest as are charged on loans granted by the Government for development purposes and iv such other similar or allied purposes as may be specified by the Government by general or special order The specific question whether a fee levied by a market committee under the Bihar Agricultural Produce Markets Act was a fee or a tax came up for consideration before the Court in <ORG> The Court repelled the contention that the market committee had not established any market inasmuch as a market must be a well defined site fully equipped as a market and made no provisions for rendering services and observed According to counsel a market must be a well defined site with market equipment and facilities The Court then rejected the contention that the fees levied by the market committee were in the nature of a tax as the committee did not render any services to the users of the market and therefore the levy of fee was illegal and stated The market committee has taken steps for the establishment of a market where buyers and sellers meet and sales and purchases of agricultural produce take place at fair prices The fees charged by the market committee are correlated to the expenses incurred by it for rendering these services The contention that the provision contained in sub of of the Act which prohibits the carrying on of any transaction of purchase or sale of agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock in a notified market area outside the market in that area infringes the right of a citizen to trade as and where he wills and therefore must be struck down as obnoxious to Art It is urged that the limitation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a balance between the freedom guaranteed in Art The fundamental right of all citizens to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation or trade or business guaranteed under Art In other words the pursuit of any lawful trade or business may be made subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be deemed essential by the legislature to be in the interests of the general public In <NAME> case supra the Court repelled the contention based on similar provision that a person who is having a licence to trade in or about the place where the market is fixed will be deprived of his livelihood unless he resorts to the market and therefore it was an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business on the fundamental right of a citizen to carry on trade or business under Art That takes us to the contention that there is no liability cast on the petitioners to pay market fee on transactions of sale and purchase of notified agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock taking place from their business premises in the notified market area but outside the market in that area It is suggested that there were amounts held in surplus by almost all the market committees and therefore there was no lawful justification for the increase in the rate of market fee There is no warrant for any of the contentions The contention that there is no liability cast on the petitioners to pay market fee on transactions of sale and purchase of notified agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock proceeds on a wrongful assumption that they can still carry on such trade from their premises in the notified market area but outside the market in that area The petitioners cannot be heard to say by committing a breach of sub of that since they effect their transactions in the notified market area but outside the market there is no liability to pay market fee because there is no quid pro quo i services are not rendered outside the market There is a fallacy underlying the argument that since the services are rendered by the market committees within the market proper there is no liability to pay a market fee on purchase or sale taking place in the notified market area but outside the market The contention does not take note of the fact that the establishment of a regulated market for the purchase or sale of notified agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock is itself a service rendered to persons engaged in the business of purchase or sale of such commodities repelled a similar contention and observed The argument proceed on the assumption that sales and purchases of notified agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock in a notified market area could take place even outside the market Section of the Act prohibits sales or purchases of notified agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock outside the market The view expressed by <ORG> in these two cases is clearly in consonance with the scheme of the Act We are unable to appreciate that there is irreconcilable conflict between sub of It was contended that many of the petitioners are food grains dealers licensed under the Andhra Pradesh Foodgrains Dealers Licensing order issued under sub The petitioners having been licensed as dealers under sub of are bound by the terms and conditions of their licence and also they are subject to the restrictions imposed by sub of Stress was particularly laid on these observations which torn out of context tend to suggest that there must be actual quid pro quo between the prayer and the market committee i there must be actual correlation between the service rendered by a market committee and the prayer of the market fee and that such service must be In relation to each transaction A fee is levied essentially for services rendered and as such there is an element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the fee and the public authority which imposes it These observations must be read in the context in which they appear <NAME> It is however strenuously urged on the strength of these observations made in <NAME> case supra that the market committees have not placed all relevant material to show with reason able certainty that at least a good and substantial portion of the amount collected on account of fees may be in the neighborhood of two thirds or three fourths was being spent for rendering services to the petitioners nor was there any material to show that a substantial portion of the fee realized was actually spent for rendition of any special benefit to them There was quite some discussion at the <ORG> as to the binding effect of the aforesaid observations made by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra In that case there was sufficient material showing that the income from the market fee in the State of Punjab had become a source of revenue and therefore the increase the rate of market fee from Rs <ORG> in exercise of the powers vested under xvii and xvii directed <ORG> and the market committees throughout the State to contribute rupees one crore to <ORG> at Faridkot Every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved since the generality of the expressions which may be found that there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law but governed or qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found It would appear that there are certain observations to be found in the judgment in <NAME> case supra which were really not necessary for purposes of the decision and go beyond the occasion and therefore they have no binding authority though they may have merely persuasive value The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as part of a common burden while a fee is for payment of a specific benefit or privilege although the special advantage is secondary to the primary motive of regulation in public interest The power of any legislature to levy a fee is conditioned by the fact that it must be by and large a quid pro quo for the services rendered There is no genic difference between a tax and a fee Compulsion lies in the fact that payment is enforceable by law against a person inspite of his unwillingness or want of consent A levy in the nature of a fee does not cease to be of that character merely because there is an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it nor is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual service rendered by the authority to each individual who obtains the benefit of the service para Viewed from this perspective the conclusion is inevitable that the observation made in <NAME> case that At least a good and substantial portion of the amount collected on account of fees may be in the neighborhood of two thirds or three fourths must be shown with reasonable certainty as being spent for rendering services in the market to the payer of fee was not intended to lay down a rule of universal application but it was a decision which must be confined to the special facts of that case There are many other observations in <NAME> case which were really not necessary for purposes of the decision in that case and need to be clarified In the present case there is no allegation anywhere by any of the petitioners nor was any contention advanced that there was any unauthorized expenditure by any of the market committees for purposes not authorized by the Act There is no material placed on record by the petitioners to show that the market committees are rendering no service Under the scheme of the Act there are certain obligatory duties of a market committee Chapter provides for various regulatory measures in Rules to for the control of a market in that correct weigh ments would be secured storage facilities provided and equal powers of bargaining assured so that the growers may bring their agricultural produce livestock and products of livestock to the market and sell them at a reasonable price There was not a whisper during the course of the arguments that the market committees were not providing the services as enjoined by Rules to If any particular market committee persistently makes default in not performing the duties imposed on it by or under the Act or neglects or refuses to carry out any general or special direction issued by <ORG> under sub of as regards providing of facilities or abuses its powers the petitioners have the remedy to take up the matter with <ORG> No doubt the petitioners initially pay the market fee under sub of of the Act but there is passing on of liability by them to the consumer as part of the price The services are rendered to the users of the market i the growers of agricultural produce livestock or products of livestock and persons engaged in the business of purchase or sale of the same There still remains the question that if purchase or sale of paddy has suffered market fee in the hands of a rice miller whether subsequent purchase or sale of rice by a miller to a trader or by a trader to a trader should again be subjected to payment of market fee The decision in <NAME> case supra turned on a construction of sub clause of iii of the Uttar Pradesh Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam as amended by Act of It was conceded in that case on behalf of <ORG> and the market committees that there cannot be any multi point levy of market fee in the same market area There is distinction between paddy and rice and although paddy is milled into rice by the process of de husking they are two separate and distinct commercials commodities and have both been separately specified as notified agricultural produce in Schedule II of the Rules as items and respectively On the plain language of sub of of the Act the market fee is leviable on both on purchase paddy by a rice miller from a producer and also on purchase or sale of rice by a miller to a trader or by a trader to a trader because there is service rendered by a market committee at each of the stages The matter was however re examined by <ORG> with reference to the provisions contained in sub of of the Act The preliminary notification proposing to amend rule of the A Agricultural Produce Livestock Markets Rules issued in first read above and published at pages of the Rules supplement to Part II of the A Gazette No dated is here by cancelled The question is not by any means free from difficulty but after carefully considering the argument which has been addressed to us we have come to the conclusion that there is no reason why the word and should be read disjunctively as or This is of course subject to the qualification that such sale or purchase has taken place in the notified market area but outside the market in that area as enjoined by the proviso to There is very little that we could add in the connected matters
