On behalf of respondent consumers it was contended that <ORG> was barred from conducting its operations on commercial lines so as to earn a profit that in the absence of specifications by <ORG> the position would be as it was before the Amendment i the <ORG> was to carry on its affairs and adjust the tariffs in such a manner as not to incur a loss that while interest which accrued to be revenue expenditure arrears of interest which accrued during the previous years and had not been paid could not be so considered that the <ORG> took into consideration the anticipated augmentation of the generating capacity from the proposed new power stations whereas these projects were not commissioned till and thus the cost structure arrived at by the <ORG> was vitiated that the <ORG> did not take into account the financial position of the <ORG> as brought out by the year which showed that the <ORG> had no need for enhancing the rates that the <ORG> having taken as the basis the projected cost so as to maintain price stability for a period of five years it was not proper to revise the tariff again in and that it was not open to the <ORG> to give favoured treatment to Low Tension Domestic and Agricultural Consumers at the cost of the rest of the consumers If the <ORG> borrows sums either from the <ORG> or from other sources or by the issue of debentures and bonds the <ORG> must of necessity make provision year after year for the payment of interest on the loans taken by it and for the repayment of the capital amounts of the loans If the <ORG> is unable to pay interest in any year for want of sufficient revenue receipts the <ORG> must make provision for payment of such arrear of interest in succeeding years The total operational cost would include the interest on the capital outlay out of the national exchequer and that there was no justification to run a public utility monopoly service undertaking merely as a commercial venture with a view to make profits it is noticed that the Electricity Supply Act requires <ORG> to follow a particular method of accounting and it is on the basis of that method of accounting that the <ORG> is required to generate a surplus Section stipulates that in specifying the surplus the <ORG> shall have due regard to the availability of amounts accrued by way of depreciation and the liability for loan amortization There is no doubt that arrears of interest are under the scheme of accounting contemplated by the Act required to be paid out of revenue receipts of the <ORG> and are expenses properly chargeable to revenues within the meaning of that expression in of the Act Once it is established there is hardly any revenue surplus left after meeting the expenses required to be met by the complaint of the consumers that there was no justification for the tariff increase because of large surpluses earned by the <ORG> loses all force The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals preferred by <ORG> raise the question of the extent of the authority of the <ORG> to increase the Electricity Tariff under the Electricity Supply Act We have however extracted that provision also for a better understanding of as it stood before the amendment We consider that for the purpose of understanding and construing as it stood before the amendment we are entitled to take into consideration the <ORG> exposition contained in the amendment Provision for the sale of electricity by the <ORG> to persons other than licensees Subject to the provisions of this Act and of regulation if any made in this behalf the <ORG> may supply electricity to any person not being a licensee upon such terms and conditions as the <ORG> thinks fit and may for the purposes of such supply frame uniform tariffs In fixing the uniform tariffs the <ORG> shall have regard to all or any of the following factors namely a the nature of the supply and the purposes for which it is required the co ordinated development of the supply and distribution of electricity within the State in the most efficient and economical manner with particular reference to such development in areas not for the time being served or adequately served by the licensee the simplification and standardization of methods and rates of charges for such supplies the extension and cheapening of supplies of electricity to sparsely developed areas Section empowers <ORG> to advance loans to the <ORG> and Section empowers the <ORG> with the previous sanction of <ORG> capital under the terest on sums paid proviso to section by the State Govern ment in pursuance of viia the write guarantees under down of amounts in respect of intangi ble assets to the payment of in to which they are terest on loans actually appropria advanced to the

if any fund be called the balance amount is left Development Fund thereafter the same to be utilised for shall be utilised for a purposes bene the other purposes ficial in the opi specified in nion of the Board in such manner as <ORG> may decide It is not the function of the <ORG> to so manage its affairs as to earn the maximum profit even as a private corporate body may be inspired to earn huge profits with a view to paying large dividends to its shareholders If the <ORG> borrows sums either from the <ORG> or from other sources or by the issue of debentures and bonds surely the <ORG> must of necessity make provision year after year for the payment of interest on the loans taken by it and for the repayment of the capital amounts of the loans If the <ORG> is unable to pay interest in any year for want of sufficient revenue receipts the <ORG> must make provision for payment of such arrear of interest in succeeding years That we take it is what the <ORG> would necessarily do it was an ordinary commercial undertaking properly and prudently managed on sound commercial lines It was found that the amendment did not effectively improve matters as many State Government did not specify the quantum of surplus The Statement of Objects and Reasons relating to the amendment may also be extracted and it is as follows Though section of the Act as amended in casts an obligation on the State Government has so far specied the quantum of any surplus It is also considered necessary to re arrange the priorities with regard to distribution revenues of the Boards This is made clear by the amendment which stipulates a minimum of per cent surplus in the absence of specification by <ORG> which has the liberty to specify a higher percentage than three There is at present a general agreement among writers of repute that the price policy of such a <ORG> should neither make a loss nor a profit after meeting all capital charges and this is expressed by covering all costs or breaking even and secondly the price it charges for the services should correspond to relative costs We need not however express any opinion about it Since it is a public utility there is no justification to run it merely as a commercial venture with a view to making profits We do not know at any rate it does not fall for consideration here if a monopoly based public utility should ever be a commercial venture geared to support the general revenue of the <ORG> but there is not an iota of hestitation in us to say that the common man mode of transport closely connected with the free play of this fundamental right should not be It is of interest that in the second case dealing with the question whether interest cannot be taken into account in working out profits the court observed The facile assumption by the <ORG> that the interest should not be taken into account in working out the profits is not borne out by the provisions of the statute While the court expressed the view that there was no justification to run a public utility monopoly service undertaking merely as a commercial venture with a view to make profits the court did not rule out but refrained from expressing any opinion on the question whether a public utility monopoly service undertaking should ever be geared to earn profits to support the general revenue of the <ORG> One of the submissions which found favour with <ORG> and which was seriously pressed before us was that in the absence of specification by <ORG> the position would be as it was before the amendment that is the Board was carry on its affairs and adjust the tariffs in such a manner as not to incur a loss and no more We do not agree with the submission for the reasons already mentioned <ORG> in that case had observed and we agree with what had been said We cannot accept the contention of the appellant that merely because <ORG> has not prescribed the manner in which the capital value should be determined the municipal council is deprived of the power of levying the tax under section the omission of the rule making authority to frame rules cannot take away the right of the municipal council to levy tax at the rate mentioned in the notification issued under clause If for instance <ORG> refrained from prescribing the manner in which the value of such lands should be determined it cannot we think be said that the municipal council has no power at all to levy the tax at a percentage of the capital value merely because the method of determining the capital value has not been prescribed by <ORG> Secondly as regards the escalation clause the <ORG> recorded at page that it was not disputed on behalf of the <ORG> and the Attorney General accepted the position that a proper method should be devised for escalation or de escalation That is the person why the judgment in <ORG> mobiles supra cannot be treated as a precedent and can not afford any appreciable assistance in the decision of price fixation cases On the question of appropriate pricing policy we may conveniently refer at this juncture to what <ORG> had to say in the Seventh Five Year Plan Section further stipulates that in specifying the surplus the <ORG> shall have due regard to the availability of amounts accrued by way of depreciation and the liability for loan amortization The submission strenuously urged on behalf of the consumers before <ORG> and before us was that while interest which accrued during the year might be properly considered to be revenue expenditure arrears of interest which accrued during the previous years and had not been paid could not be so considered lakhs and since there was no arrears of interest what was payable the net revenue surplus was lakhs Once we arrive at this position that there is hardly any revenue surplus left after meeting the expenses required to be met by the complaint of the A consumers that there was no justification for the tariff increase because of large surpluses earned by the <ORG> loses all force We have examined the two reports of <ORG> of the years and and the revised tariffs based on those reports in the light of the legal and factual position explained by us Another submission made by <NAME> was that the <ORG> erred in not taking into account the financial position of the <ORG> as brought out by the year which showed that the <ORG> had already turned the corner and that there was therefore no need for enhancing the rates We do not find any force in this submission In the result we allow the appeals filed by <ORG> set aside the judgments of <ORG> uphold the validity of the notifications revising the tariffs and dismiss the writ petitions filed in <ORG> subject to direction that <ORG> will reconsider the revised tariff introduced in in regard to Low Tension Industrial and Low Tension Commercial Consumers only with liberty to fix separate rates if necessary for the years and
