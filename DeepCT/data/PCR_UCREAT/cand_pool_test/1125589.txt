Who can file petition under In August the Committee by a resolution decided to locate the contra at the second village but the respondent directed that the matter should be decided by <ORG> as by the time the Andhra Pradesh Panchayat <ORG>s and Zilla Parishads Act had come into force and <ORG> had been established for the concerned Block Though in May <ORG> at first resolved to have the centre at the first village and though the said resolution was approved by the respondent <ORG> finally by its resolution on th May cancelled its earlier resolution and resolved to locate the centre at the second village The appellant who was the representative of the first village in all the proceedings filed an application before <ORG> under Art In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that i Assuming the first <ORG> order dated th March was made under the impugned order dated th April reviewing the first was invalid in as much as the prerequisite for the exercise of the power of review namely the existence of a mistake of fact or law or the ignorance of any material fact was not satisfied ii the first <ORG> order was made under of the Act and therefore could not be reviewed by the impugned order under and iii the impugned order was invalid because it was made without giving an opportunity to the party prejudiced thereby The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the appellant had no personal right in the matter and therefore had no locus stand to file the application and also urged that the impugned order was neither made under nor under of the Act but that it was really passed under the rules made by the respondent in exercise of the power conferred on it under of the Act read with and that therefore no question of review would arise at all as the respondent passed the final order in regard to the location of the health centre HELD i The appellant had the right to maintain the application Ordinarily the petitioner who seeks to file an application under Art should be one who has a personal or individual right in the subject matter of the petition In exceptional cases a person who has been pre judicially affected by an act or omission of an authority can file a petition even though he has no proprietary or even fiduciary interest in the subject matter His conduct the acquiescence on the part of the members of the committee and the treatment meted out to him by the authorities support the inference that he was authorised to act on behalf of the committee which was in law the trustee of the amounts collected ii A reading of of the Act with the Schedule shows that under the Act the statutory power to establish and maintain primary health centers is vested in <ORG> and there is no provision vesting the said power in the <ORG> Under of the Act the <ORG> can only make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act it cannot under the guise of rules convert an authority with power to establish a primary health centre into only a recommendatory body Therefore the Rules in so far as they make <ORG> a mere recommendatory body are inconsistent with the Act and so the impugned order could not be sustained under the authority of the Rules iii Assuming that the first order was made under the respondent was right when it said in the impugned order that it made a mistake of fact in passing its earlier order on a misapprehension that there was a permanent location of the centre at the first village A Section confers a special power on the <ORG> to cancel a resolution passed by the <ORG> by an order in writing if in its opinion such resolution is not legally passed or is in excess or abuse of the power conferred by the Act after giving to the <ORG> an opportunity for explanation Section confers a wide power of revision on the <ORG> cannot apply to an order made in exercise of a quasi judicial power under Since the impugned order was made without giving an opportunity as required by to the appellant or to the committee who were the representatives of the first village and who were prejudicially affected by it the order was bad The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of a Division Bench of <ORG> in a Letters Patent appeal confirming that of a single Judge of that Court dismissing a petition filed by the appellant under Art of the Constitution for issuing a Writ of certiorari quashing the order of <ORG> dated April under of the Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Samithis and Zilla Parishads Act Act No XXXV of hereinafter called the Act On April <ORG> Chintalapudi resolved unanimously modifying its earlier resolution to have <ORG> at Dharmajigudem village as there were High Schools and education facilities there On July i days after the aforesaid resolution the Block Development Officer wrote a letter to the appellant who was the President of the village panchayat inform ing him that he had not taken any steps for the realization of the contribution so far and that if the required contribution was not realized before the end of the month steps would be taken to shift <ORG> to some other place On July the appellant and others of Dharmajigudem informed <ORG> that it was not possible for them to collect the amount and that there was no objection to the shifting of the <ORG> from their village to any other place On July the th respondent <NAME> representing Lingapalem village deposited Rs On January the Rules framed by the <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred on it under of the Act came into force On May <ORG> at a special meeting on the ground that the meeting held on May was not held in accordance with of the Rules for the conduct of business in exercise of the power given to it under thereof cancelled all the resolutions passed by the meeting of the <ORG> on May On March the <ORG> made an order holding that there was no valid reason for shifting <ORG> from Dharmajigudem to Lingapalem and directing <ORG> to take action accordingly The main reason given for that order was that <ORG> was already func tioning at Dharmajigudem and a Health <ORG> once established should not be shifted to another place within the Block unless <ORG> resolved by two thirds majority of the members present at the meeting as required under of the Rules and that the resolution dated May was not supported by the requisite majority On April i about a year after the earlier order the <ORG> passed another order wherein it held that it passed the previous order dated March on a mistaken impression that it was a case of shifting <ORG> from one place where it was permanently located to another while the correct position was that in the instant case <ORG> was not permanently located by the <ORG> and therefore the resolution passed by <ORG> on May fell within of the Rules and not under thereof Before the Act came into force <ORG> was inaugurated at Dharmajigudem presumably subject to the condition that the said village would comply with the conditions laid down by the administrative directions governing the location of a <ORG> On August the said Committee by a resolution decided to locate the <ORG> at Lingapalem but the Government directed the matter to be decided by <ORG> as by that time the Act had come into force and <ORG> for the Block had been established It will therefore be seen that though the Health <ORG> was formally inaugurated at Dharmajigudem before the Act came into force there was not and could not have been a permanent location of the <ORG> at that place as the condition precedent was not compiled with After the Act came into force though <ORG> at first approved of the location of the <ORG> at Dharmajigudem it cancelled the resolution and decided to locate it at Lingapalem The question is whether on these facts the Government had jurisdiction to make the order which it did in exercise of its powers under of the Act The appellant who was the representative of the village of Dhartnajigudem in all the said proceedings filed an application before <ORG> under Art Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant raised before us the following points The order of the <ORG> cancelling the resolution dated May was made under of the Act and therefore the said order could not be reviewed under thereof The order dated April was also invalid because it was made without giving an opportunity to the party prejudiced thereby of making a representation against the making of the said order Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the State of Andhra Pra desh raised a preliminary objection that the appellant had no personal right in the matter of the location of the Primary Health Center and therefore he had no locus stand to file an application under Art lie argued that the order of the <ORG> dated March was not simply a cancella lion of a resolution made by <ORG> but a composite order giving directions to the Block Development Officer and therefore it fell directly within the scope of of the Act and as the said order was made under a misapprehension that there was a permanent location of the Health Centre at Dharmajigudem the <ORG> had jurisdiction to review the same under of the Act In addition he raised before us a new point which was not argued either before the single Judge or on appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> He would say that the impugned order was neither made under or under of the Act but it was really passed under the relevant Rules made by the Gov ernment in exercise of the power conferred on it under of the Act read with sub of thereof where under the ultimate authority under the Act to locate the Health Centre was the <ORG> though on the recommendation of <ORG> of the Constitution in <ORG> observed Article confers a very wide power on <ORG> to issue directions and writs of the nature mentioned therein for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose His conduct the acquiescence on the part of the other members of the committee and the treatment meted out to him by the authorities concerned support the inference that he was authorized to act on behalf of the committee We have therefore no hesitation to hold that the appellant had the right to maintain the application under Art This Court held in the decision cited supra that ordinarily the petitioner who seeks to file an application under Art of the Constitution should be one who has a personal or individual right in the subject matter of the petition That apart in exceptional cases as the expression ordinarily indicates a person who has been prejudicially affected by an act or omission of an authority can file a writ even though he has no proprietary or even fiduciary interest in the subject matter thereof Briefly stated his contention was that the order of the <ORG> dated April was not made either under or under of the Act but was made only under the Rules made by the <ORG> in exercise of its power under of the Act Even in such a case the <ORG> has no power to direct the shifting of a Primary Health Centre established in one place to another if the contribution from the people had been accepted and is in deposit There is no provision vesting the said power in the Gov ernment Under of the Act the <ORG> can only make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act it cannot under the guise of the said rules convert an authority with power to establish <ORG> into only a recommendatory body Realizing this difficulty the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the th respondent made an attempt to reconcile the relevant rules with the provisions of of the Act The Rules also confer a power on the District Medical Officer and the District Health Officer in the matter of location of the <ORG> and give the <ORG> the final voice if there is any conflict between those officers and <ORG> Section of the Act reads Power of revision and review by Government The Government may either suo motu or on an application from any person interested call for and examine the record of <ORG> or <ORG> or of their <ORG> in respect of any proceeding to satisfy themselves as to the regularity of such proceeding or the correctness legality or propriety of any decision or order passed therein and if in any case it appears to the Government that any such decision or order should be modified annulled or reversed or remitted for reconsideration they may pass orders accordingly Provided that the Government shall not pass any order prejudicial to any party unless such party has had an opportunity of making a representation The provisions contained in the proviso to sub section and in sub section shall apply in respect of any proceeding under this sub section as they apply to a proceeding under subsection Sub section of of the Act confers a wide power on the <ORG> to revise any decision or order passed in any proceeding under the Act Sub section thereof confers a power on the <ORG> to review the order made under sub thereof if it was passed by the <ORG> under any mistake whether of fact or of law or in ignorance of any material fact Under the <ORG> may by order in writing cancel any resolution passed by a Panchayat Samithi if in its opinion such resolution is not legally passed or is in excess or abuse of the powers conferred by or under the Act or for any other reasons mentioned therein Section confers a general power on the <ORG> and on its terms if there was no other section it can cancel a resolution of a Panchayat Samithi So the learned counsel for the <ORG> as well as for the th respondent made a serious effort to bring the order of the <ORG> dated March within the terms of of the Act The President <NAME> and others have represented to <ORG> against acceptance of the resolution passed by the <ORG> at its meeting held on Under Rule of the Rules for the establishment and maintenance of Primary Health Centres by Panchayat Samithis made under the provisions of <ORG>s and Zilla Parishads Act <ORG> once established shall not ordinarily be shifted to another place within the Block unless the Samithi resolves by rd majority of the members present at the meeting as required under rule of the said rules In the above circumstances the Government consider that there are no valid reasons for shifting <ORG> from Dharmajigudem to Lingapalem It was said that the said order did not mention the section whereunder it was passed that it did not cancel any resolution that it did not in terms approve or disapprove any resolution that it considered other orders issued and finally gave a direction to the Block Development Officer to take action in accordance with the terms of the order Then it gives the reason that the said resolution was bad inasmuch as that under of the Rules <ORG> once established should not ordinarily be shifted to another place within the Block unless <ORG> resolves by two thirds majority of the members of the <ORG> present at the meeting as required by of the Rules For the said reasons the order concludes that there were no valid reasons for shifting <ORG> from Dharmajigudem to Lingapalem The Gov ernment then gives the consequential directions to the Block Development Officer to take action accordingly We therefore hold that the order of the <ORG> dated March was one made under of the Act and therefore it could not be reviewed under thereof Reliance is placed upon of the Madras General Clauses Act whereunder if any power is conferred on the Government that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires But that section cannot apply to an order made in exercise of a quasi judicial power Section of the Act confers a power on the Government to cancel or suspend the resolution of a Panchayat Samithi in the circumstances mentioned therein after giving an opportunity for explanation to <ORG> Therefore there are no merits in this contention It was in violation of the mandatory provision of sub of which says that the <ORG> shall before taking action under sub give <ORG> an opportunity for explanation Two objections were raised against the validity of the order reviewing the previous order namely i there was no mistake of fact or law and ii the said order which was prejudicial to Dharmajigudem village was made without giving an opportunity to the representatives of the said village of making a representation Therefore the <ORG> was right when it said in its order that it made a mistake of fact in passing its earlier order on March on a misapprehension that there was a permanent location of the <ORG> at Dhar majigudem But there is another flaw in the order of the <ORG> dated April i it made the order without giving an opportunity to the representatives of Dhartnajigudem who were prejudicially affected by the said order Learned counsel for the <ORG> said that the appellant could not be considered to be a party prejudicially affected by that order The <ORG> should have therefore given notice either to him or to the <ORG> which was representing the village all through for the purpose of securing the location of <ORG> in their village Both the orders of the Government namely the order dated March and that dated April were not legally passed the former because it was made without giving notice to <ORG> and the latter because the Government had no power under of the Act to review an order made under of the Act and also because it did not give notice to the representatives of Dharmajigudem village In those circumstances was it a case for <ORG> to interfere in its discretion and quash the order of the Government dated April If <ORG> had quashed the said order it would have restored an illegal order it would have given <ORG> to a village contrary to the valid resolutions passed by <ORG>
