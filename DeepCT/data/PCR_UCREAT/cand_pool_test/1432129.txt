HEADNOTE Section of the and Berar Municipalities Act empowered the municipalities to impose a terminal tax on goods or animals imported into or exported from the limits of a municipality The appellant disputed his liability to pay terminal tax and claimed a refund Held that the goods which were in transit and were merely carried across the limits of the municipality were not liable to terminal tax Terminal tax on goods imported into or exported from the limits of a municipality was payable on goods on their journey ending within the municipal limits or commencing therefrom and not where the goods were merely in transit and had their terminus elsewhere Similarly the words exported from do not merely indicate taking out but have reference to the taking out of goods which had become part and parcel of the mass of the property of the local area and will not apply to goods in transit i brought into the area for the purpose of being transported out of it The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by Special Leave against a Judgment and order of <ORG> at Nagpur dated February and the question for decision turns upon the construction of of the Berar Municipalities Act Act II of which in this judgment will be termed the Act On refusal by the Municipality the appellant took an appeal to the Deputy Commissioner Wardha which was sent for disposal to the Sub Divisional Officer who on March referred the following two questions under of the Act to <ORG> for its opinion Whether goods passing through the limits of Wardha Municipality by road despatched from Yeotmal to their destination at Nagpur without being unloaded or reloaded at Wardha are liable for an export terminal tax Whether the respondent <ORG> is not liable to refund the export terminal tax collect ed on such goods The reference in the first instance came up for hearing before <NAME> who referred the matter to <ORG> and <ORG> in turn referred it to <ORG> <ORG> after referring to a number of decided cases was of the opinion that the tax had been validly imposed and the appellant was therefore not entitled to a refund The sub section provides A committee may from time to time and subject to the provisions of this Chapter impose in the whole or in any part of the municipality any of the following taxes for the purposes of this Act namely a a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situate within the limits of the municipality with reference to the gross annual letting value of the buildings or lands a tax on persons exercising any profession or art

vehicles animals or dogs are kept within the limits of the municipality a toll on vehicles and animals used as aforesaid entering the limits of the municipality and on boats moored within those limits Provided that a toll under this clause shall not be payable on any vehicle or animal on which a tax under clause has been imposed an octroi on animals or goods brought within the limits of the municipality for sale consumption or use within those limits market dues on persons exposing goods for sale in market or in any place belonging to or under the control of the Government or of the

the limits of the municipality according to their circumstances and property within those imits a terminal tax on goods or animals imported into or exported from the limits of a municipality Provided that a terminal tax under this clause and an octroi under clause shall not be in force in any municipality at the same time and a tax on i persons travelling by railway to or from a municipality to which pilgrims resort or ii pilgrims visiting a shrine within the limits of a municipality Rule I of the Terminal Tax Rules made under the Act relates to exports and to imports They provide On the following goods exported by rail or road a terminal tax shall be levied at the rate noted against each at as per maund of seers Cotton On the following goods imported by rail or road a terminal tax shall be levied at the rate noted against each from and the word terminal has reference to the termini of the jurisdictional limits of the municipality and not to the journey of the goods In construing these words of the statute if there are two possible interpretations then effect is to be given to the one that favours the citizen and not the one that imposes a burden on him Lexico logically they do not have any reference to goods in transit a word derived from transire bearing a meaning similar to transport i to go across Even according to the ordinary meaning of the words which is relied upon by the respondent goods which are in transit or are being transported can hardly be called goods imported into or exported from because they are neither being exported nor imported but are merely goods carried across a particular stretch of territory or across a particular area with the object of being transported to their ultimate destination which in the instant case was Nagpur The respondent counsel sought to support his argument by referring to the following cases decided by various Indian <ORG> where the words import and export were construed as meaning bring in or take out of or away from and it was also held that goods in transit are also covered by the words imported into or exported from The court held In our opinion there is no force in this contention <NAME> said at There is no such limitation on the meaning of the word import which must be given its ordinary meaning and at the learned Judge observed We are of the opinion that the word import in Ahmedabad Municipal Code must be given its ordinary meaning and that is to bring something within the Municipal limits from a place without its boundaries irrespective of the consideration as to whether the goods were manufactured within the Municipal limits how long they were outside those limits and for what purpose There are also some unreported judgments of <ORG> taking a different view of the words imported into or exported from and those have been referred to in the judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> case and in the referring order of <NAME> in the present case <NAME> said at There is nothing in the language of the Act to shew that the word exported was used in any other than its ordinary sense Construing the words of the Act upon this principle we feel bound to hold that coals carried away from the port not on a temporary excursion as in a tug or pleasure boat which intends to return with more or less of the coals on board and which may be regarded as always constructively within the port but taken away for the purpose of being wholly consumed beyond the limits of the port are coals exported within the meaning of the Act It was urged that in accordance with the current authority of the different courts of India a different interpretation should not be placed on the words of the section but this argument is of little avail in a case Moreover it is not a case of disturbing the course of construction which has continued unchallenged for such a length of time as to acquire the sanction of continued decisions over a very long period and there is therefore no principle which will preclude this court from correcting the error In another case <NAME> <NAME> under the statute the duty was imposed on all goods imported into or exported from Berwick harbour which extended down the Tweed to the sea but no part of it extended above the bridge By giving to the words imported into or exported from their derivative meaning without any reference to the ordinary connotation of these words as used in the commercial sense the decided cases in India have ascribed too general a meaning to these words which it appears from the setting context and history of the clause was not intended Such an interpretation would lead to absurdity which has according to the rules of interpretation to be avoided It is as essential an ingredient as indispensable to the existence of the entire thing then as importation itself This supports the contention raised that import is not merely the bringing into but comprises something more i incorporating and mixing up of the goods imported with the mass of the property in the local area Similarly the word export has reference to taking out of goods which had become part and parcel of the mass of the property of the local area and will not Wheat Ed Even assuming that the words imported into or exported from could be restricted only to their derivative meaning and thus construed to mean only brought into or taken out or away from this general meaning it was submitted by the appellant is qualified by the use of the prefix terminal used adjectively with the word tax which makes it necessary to determine the meaning of the term terminal tax In that case the court refused to regard automobile parking lots as falling within the scope of a statute which imposed a tax on general warehouse storage establishments Item was as follows Item A terminal tax on goods imported into or exported from a local area save where such tax is first imposed in a local area in which a octroi was not levied on or before the th July In <ORG> the item No which is as follows Taxes on the entry of goods into a local area for consumption use or sale therein and Item No is Taxes on goods and passengers carried by road or on inland waterways The substituted tax was terminal tax on goods imported into or exported from a local area and by rules this tax in the case of <ORG> was imposed on certain class of goods imported and on others exported by railway or road In the terminal tax was made leviable on goods carried by railway or air but the tax on entry of goods was imposable on goods for consumption use or sale in a local area There is no evidence that the actual object of the Act in the present case was to extend the powers of the Municipalities to imposing the tax on articles which were in the course of transit Therefore terminal tax on goods imported or exported is similar in its incidence and is payable on goods on their journey ending within the municipal limits or commencing therefrom and not where the goods were merely in transit through the municipal limits and had their terminus elswhere There is no reason to give to this word a different meaning in item No of Scheduled Tax Rules under the Government of India Act of or in clause of of the Act The following passage from the judgment of Spens <NAME> shows the meaning to be attached to the word terminal There appears to us a definite distinction between the type of taxes referred to as terminal taxes in Entry No of List I of Sch In our judgment there is no limitation to be implied in Entry No List II in regard to the manner in which goods may be transported into a local area The grounds of taxation under the two entries are as indicated above radically different and there is no case for suggesting that taxation under the one entry limits or interferes in any way with taxation under the other The tax imposed in that case was held not to be a terminal tax but merely a cess on entry of goods into the local area within Entry No of List II even though it was imposed on railborne goods entering the municipal area It is a noticeable feature of that apart from the terminal tax there are other heads of taxation imposable by the Municipality and in the case of each one of these heads the tax is on some activity which takes place within the jurisdictional limits of the Municipality This supports the contention of the appellant that the terminal tax leviable under cl properly construed must have reference to some activity within the municipal area i the entry for the purpose of remaining within that area or commencement of journey from that area The appellant will have its costs in this court and in <ORG>
