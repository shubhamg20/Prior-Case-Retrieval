arising from the Jaipur firm could be set off against his share income from the several businesses in British India in computing income of the assessee the head business Acting under Section of the Act we therefore referred the case back to <ORG> to state such additional facts as may be necessary and refer to us for opinion the question which we held arose from the facts of the case We will advert to that in some detail later on His income from property was computed at Rs Under Section a and i and ii of the Act subject to the provisions of the Act the total income of any previous year of any person who is a resident and an ordinary resident of British India during such year includes all income profits and gains from what ever source derived which are received or deemed to be received in British India in such year or which accrued or arisen to him in British India during such year or which accrued or arose to him without British India during such year When the assessee is a partner in a firm his share income or share loss has to be computed in the manner provided by Section and included in his total income and under the proviso to that section if the share so computed is a loss such loss may be set off or carried forward and set off in accordance with the provision of Section But if such income is from an unregistered firm carrying on business wholly out of British India it would not be so exempt from taxation in the hands of the partner under this provision It follows that the assessee was carrying on the business at Jaipur in the firm name through his agents and that the income he would have received from that business would be the profits of that business earned out of British India The learned counsel for the Commissioner next submitted that the several businesses are distinct businesses though they have a common partner and the loss in one cannot be set off against the profits in the other That assessee was carrying on money lending business and other businesses The learned counsel for the Commissioner has drawn our attention to the second proviso to Section sub section which say Provided further that where the assessee is an unregistered firm any such loss shall be set off only against the income profits and gains of the firm and not against the income profits and gains of any of the partners of the firm In our view this proviso has no application as it is an exception to the general provision for set off in Section which refers to a set off of losses under one head against the income under any other head mentioned in Section of the Act As observed by <NAME> in his Interpretation of Statutes th edition page The true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail There is no rule that the first or enacting part is be construed without reference to the proviso The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest There is no other rule even in the case of a proviso in the strictest or narrowest sense <NAME> <NAME> To this general rule the second proviso provides an exception that in the case of an unregistered firm any loss of that firm under one head must be set off against its income profits and gains under another head and not against the income profits and gains of any of its partners It is next contended that there is no provision in the Act for bringing any loss incurred out of British India into British India as the assessee seeks to do We therefore answer the question referred to us in the affirmative The Commissioner will pay the costs of the reference including the costs of the paper book A copy of this judgment be sent to <ORG> under Section of the Act We now advert to the observations of the <ORG> on the powers of <ORG> in dealing with references made to it under Section of the Act We have already set out the question of law referred to us under that section and the question of law that ought to have been referred as arising on the same facts The Appellate <ORG> seems to think that it is not bound to decide an appeal before it by applying the appropriate law to the facts found by it simply because the assessee has erroneously railed on wrong provisions in support of his relief and that it is not bound to refer to <ORG> the question of law that really arises on the facts found by it if the assessee does not raise the question of law in a particular form at the hearing of the appeal before the tribunal or in his application under Section of the Act In this view to Appellate <ORG> pointed out that this Court had no jurisdiction to refer back the case to re submit it with the question of law that this Court thought arose on the facts of the case This is a serious misconception about the duties of <ORG> in deciding appeals and the applications under Section of the Act It is a fundamental principle of administration of justice that a litigant has a right to present at any stage any question of law arising on the facts found by a <ORG> He has to plead facts an not law and the <ORG> is always under the obligation to apply the appropriate law to the facts found by it There is no provision either in the Indian Income tax Act or in the rules framed by the <ORG> to warrant a contrary view Under Section the assessee can require <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order and <ORG> shall if it finds that a question of law does arise draw up a statement of the case and refer it to <ORG> If the <ORG> is of the opinion that a question of law does not arise out of the order the assessee can move <ORG> to require <ORG> to state the case and refer it and if <ORG> is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of <ORG> it shall require the <ORG> to state the case looking at the plain language of the section apart from any authority I should have stated that a question of law arose out of the order of the <ORG> if such a question was apparent on the order itself or it could be raised on the facts found by there <ORG> and which were stated in the order I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by <ORG> We have noticed in this case and several other cases that the <ORG> does not state all the facts found by it which are necessary for answering the question that it referred to this Court but it proceeds as if it is required to decide that question of law Prior to the amendment of Section in the Commissioner in referring the case was required to submit his opinion on the case that he referred to <ORG>
