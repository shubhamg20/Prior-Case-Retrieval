The purchaser in execution of a money decree passed in one suit which might be called suit between decree holder A and judgment debtor is not the representative of the judgment debtor in suit when he prefers a claim petition when the properties are or have been attached in execution of the money decree passed in suit between decree holder A and the judgment debtor though the judgment debtors are the same in both suits He the purchaser cannot therefore take advantage of the provisions of Section Civil Procedure Code and claim a right to prefer an appeal and a second appeal against the decision in the claim petition in the suit as to under what particular circumstances a <ORG> auction purchaser can be treated as representative of the decree holder or judgment debtor and as to what proceedings can be considered as falling under Section Civil Procedure Code though a <ORG> auction purchaser who cannot be considered the representative of either the decree holder or the judgment debtor is interested in the result of and is therefore made a party to the proceedings The lower <ORG> view that no appeal lay to it is correct and we dismiss this second appeal with costs
