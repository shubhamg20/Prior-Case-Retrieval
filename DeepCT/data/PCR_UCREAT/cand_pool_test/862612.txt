In this case the main contention that has been urged on behalf of the two defendants who are appellants before us is that the monies payable under a Policy of Insurance being Policy No issued by <ORG> did not form part of the assets of the estate of one <NAME> deceased and that his widow <NAME> had no rights therein In order to understand the precise significance of this contention it is necessary to set out the facts giving rise to the litigation out of which the present appeal has arisen The material words of the Policy with which we are concerned are as follows The <ORG> hereby guarantees to insure that if the insured pays to the <ORG> at their office in Calcutta on the fifth day of March nineteen hundred and ten and each succeeding year up to and including the year of his death the sum of rupees twenty one and annas eleven only or in lieu of any such annual premium the full number of instalments thereof as may be agreed upon of which agreement the receipt granted by the <ORG> shall be full and sufficient evidence then upon proof to the satisfaction of the Office Committee of the <ORG> of the death of the insured and the title to the Policy the <ORG> will pay to Srimati <NAME> wife of the insured hereinafter called the nominee at the Head Office of the <ORG> in Calcutta or at the permanent residence of the nominee whichever may be preferred the sum of rupees five hundred only together with such additional sum or sums by way of profits as according to the <ORG> Regulations may accrue and become payable in respect of the Policy after deducting therefrom the balance of the premium if any payable in respect of the year of the insured death and also other sum or sums if any due from him to the <ORG> The assured paid all the premiums due on the Policy till his death which took place some time in He died leaving him surviving the plaintiff <NAME> his widow and three sons The defendants Nos and who had obtained a decree against the sons of the deceased and the defendant No who had also obtained another decree against them attached the amount payable under the Policy in execution of their two decrees The plaintiff thereupon preferred a claim under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure but her claim was disallowed and the money due under the Policy was rateably distributed among the three execution creditors it ought to be held that having regard to the words used in the Policy there was no trust created in favour of the plaintiff and that she was not entitled to realise the money in question from <ORG> and that the said money formed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased On the other hand it has been contended on behalf of the plaintiff respondent that she was beneficially interested in the said Policy and that she atone was entitled to enforce the claim arising thereunder It has further been argued that the Married Woman Property Act of applies to this case and that therefore it cannot be questioned there was a trust in favour of the plaintiff and that the latter was entitled to realise the money in question from <ORG> Under the English Law if A contracts with for a benefit to be given to although that was the object and purpose of the contract may not sue on that contrast unless in certain excepted cases The plaintiff was Their Lordships observed as follows First it is contended on the authority of <NA<NAME>E> <NA<NAME>E> Jur Here the agreement executed by the defendant specifically charges immoveable property for the allowance which he binds himself to pay to the plaintiff she is the only person beneficially entitled under it the transferee of a debtor liability had acknowledged his obligation to the creditor for the debt to be paid by him under the provisions of a registered instrument conveying to him all the moveable and immoveable properties of the original debtor and the acknowledgment had been communicated to the creditor and accepted by him In this connexion reference may be made to an English case where the facts were as follows A tradesman made a Will bequeathing an interest to <NAME> his wife sister It was held by <NA<NAME>E> <NA<NAME>E> <NA<NAME>E> Hare that the effect of the agreement between <NAME> husband and the testator was to create an obligation in equity upon the surviving partner and in that respect it did not differ from a trust i that the partnership articles created a trust in favour of the widow The promise is one which could only take effect upon his death and therefore it must be meant to be enforced by them It does not seem to me that apart from the Statute such a Policy would create any trust in favour of the wife In my opinion I can see nothing in the present case which would justify me to distinguish it from the cases referred to above The second contention is that the Married Woman Property Act of is applicable to this case and that by virtue of Section of the Act a trust has been created in favour of the plaintiff The second contention urged on behalf of the respondent must also be negatived The third contention is absolutely devoid of substance and there is nothing in Section Civil Procedure Code which could prevent the creditors of the sons of the deceased from attaching the money payable under the Policy Clause of Section of the Contract Act widens the definition of consideration so as to enable a party to a contract to enforce the same in India in certain cases in which the English Law would regard that party as the recipient of a purely voluntary promise and would refuse to him a right of action on the ground of nudum pactum to suppose that in India persons who are not parties to a contract can be admitted to sue thereon except where there is an obligation in equity amounting to a trust arising out of the contract I say nothing as to whether special rules of law may be applicable to communities among whom marriages are contracted for minors by parents and guardians but putting aside such cases I see no reason to think that the law in India contains a series of exceptions to the principle that a contract can only be sued upon as such by a party thereto It is another matter altogether to say that a person not a party to a contract may bring a suit upon the contract by reason of near relationship to the promisee
