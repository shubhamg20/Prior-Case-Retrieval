A compromise decree fixing the payments of certain instalments on specified dates was passed The decree further provided that in case of default of two consecutive instalments the decree holder would have the right to recover the whole amount by execution The dates fixed for payment were th June th June th June rd June nd June th June st May and th June The decree holder filed the present application on st May in which he mentioned all the instalments but separated the first three from the rest by means of cross marks He did not indicate in his application that it was his case that these instalments were barred by time or that they had been paid but it is a fact that he did not ask for recovery of these instalments The <ORG> below have found that the first three instalments were in fact paid and that there was no default The judgment debtors have come up in appeal and reiterate their plea of limitation and further urge that it was not open to the <ORG>s below to go into the question of the payments out of <ORG> It was held by all the Judges in the <ORG> case of <NAME> Sriohand A I All Under that sub clause an application for execution where the application is to enforce any payment which the decree or order directs to be made at a certain date must be made within three years from such date It is however contended on behalf of the appellants that inasmuch as the right to apply accrued on the occurrence of the second default in and the decree holder became entitled to recover the whole amount time began to run in respect of the instalments from that date and the whole claim is now barred by time And air the three Judges took the view that so far as the instalments which had already fallen due were concerned the appropriate article was Article The view of the majority accordingly was that it was not necessary to enforce the default clause in order to recover instalments which had already fallen due and that an application for recovery of such instalments would be governed by Article and would be in time if filed within three years of the dates of the various instalments An application for recovery of instalments more than three years old would be beyond time unless there was an acknowledgment or payment sufficient to save limitation But as regards the future instalments not yet fallen due and which were not yet recoverable unless the default clause was enforced the appropriate article was Article and time would begin to run from the date when the right to apply accrued The further question as to the date from which the time under Article would begin to run namely whether from the date when the right to apply accrued on the first occasion or from the date when it accrued on the last occasion did not directly arise in the case because all the instalments had fallen due before the application for execution was made On of A I remarked In such circumstances the application for the recovery of the amounts of instalments which fell due more than three years prior to the application would unless it was saved by Sections or be barred by time but the application would still be within time as regards those instalments which fell duo within three years in spite of a default clause As the dates fixed for all the instalments had expired before the application for execution was made there was no necessity for the decree holder to enforce the default clause In my separate judgment I did not deal with the question whether time would begin to run from the date when the right to apply first accrued or from any subsequent accrual of a similar right <NAME> seems to have held at that Article would apply to an application for execution in respect of the future instalments but further added that the right to apply would accrue on the first date of default and again on the occurrence of each default in respect of that and the previous default Thus in the separate judgments that were delivered only one Judge had expressed the opinion that there would be successive accruals of the right to apply the other two did not express any opinion at all In the opinion of the <ORG> which was expressed at the end of the judgment and which was the opinion of the only Judge who had expressed it it was accordingly mentioned that if the application is one for the remaining unpaid balance of the decretal amount under the second part of the decree default clause it is not governed by Article at all but by Article and limitation will run from the date of any two successive defaults the decree holder being entitled to a decree for the whole of the balance due less the amount of any individual instalments which regarded as individual instalments are not already barred by limitation The condition in the compromise decree already referred to laid down that the decree holder would have the right to recover the whole amount on the occurrence of two successive defaults in the payment of instalments There had been a considerable difference of opinion as to whether it is open to a creditor to waive his right to recover the whole amount where an option is given to him in case of default Their Lordships held that a mortgagor could not take advantage of his own default and claim a right to redeem before the expiry of the period and that therefore the mere fact that there was an option given to the mortgagee for his own benefit to sue for the whole amount would not make the money become due so as to make the time run against the mortgagee But in the latter portion of the judgment their Lordships also pointed out that If in the Indian cases the question ware when did the mortgagee cause of action arise i when did he first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decision was that time began to run from the date when the mortgagee first become entitled to exercise option no matter whether he chose to exercise it or not It seems to me that the expression right to apply accrues is more emphatic than the expression cause of action arises If the date when the cause of action arises is to be considered to be the first date when one becomes entitled to sue for the relief claimed by him then the date when he becomes entitled to apply is certainly the date when the right to apply by way enforcing the default clause accrued to the mortgagee when on the first occasion there was a default in the payment of two successive instalments namely in the year This however does not mean that his remedy to recover the instalments as and when they fall due is also equally barred I have already pointed out that the application for execution of the decree for recovery of these instalments for which dates have been specified in the decree is governed by Article the application is still within time as regards these installments which had fallen due within three years in spite of the default clause I would accordingly hold that the application for the recovery of the instalments for and is within time whereas the application for the recovery of the instalment for was premature I would accordingly allow the appeal in part I entirely agree with the Hon ble the Chief Justice but having regard to the importance of the points raised in this appeal and having regard to the fact that points similar to the one before us arise very often in execution of instalment decrees I would like to add a few words It can after mentioning the several dates fixed for payment for instalments as follows In the case of default in the payment of two successive instalments the decree holder would be entitled decreedar ho ikhtiar hoga to realize the entire balance of his decretal amount irrespective of the fact whether or not instalments have fallen due by execution of the decree The decree holder applied for execution in respect of the last five instalments When the application for execution was made the judgment debtors objected that they had never made any payment and the application was time barred inasmuch as the right to apply for execution accrued to the decree holders on th June it was not open to the decree holder to certify payment of the first three instalments after the judgment debtors had taken an objection to the execution of the decree on the ground that he had made no payment According to the terms of the decree the decree holder had two distinct rights Then the question is when did the right to apply accrue to the decree holder within the meaning of column of Article The right to apply in this case therefore accrued to the decree holder on th June More than three years having elapsed from that date it is no longer open to the decree holder to apply for recovery of such instalments as had not fallen due on st May when he made his application for exeeution the instalments as and when they fall due are recoverable under Article Schedule Lim
