The appellant in reply questioned the validity of the Act on the ground that it contravened Art The Judges of <ORG> who heard the matter field that the impugned Act was intra vires though on different grounds and dismissed the petition Article A of the Constitution has no retrospective effect and cannot apply and the matter must be decided on the law as it stood at the date of the Writ petition Such a transfer can be valid only if it gives a complete discharge to the employer from the debts The Act contains no provision granting a discharge to the debtor Consequently the impugned Act which takes over the rights of the employees in respect of wages due to them without compensation and is therefore unconstitutional as contravening Art It is carrying on business in the manufacture of textiles and owns three factories called <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> all of which are situate in Bombay XL of hereinafter referred to as the Act and it came into force on June We may at this stage refer to the relevant provisions of the Act as it is their validity that is the main point for our determination in this appeal Section is the definition section sub defines an employee as meaning any person who is employed for hire or reward to do any work skilled or unskilled manual or clerical in an establishment Employer is defined in sub as meaning any person who employs either directly or through another person either on behalf of himself or any other person one or more employees in an establishment and includes in a factory any person named under i of the Factories Act as the manager Section provides for the appointment of an officer called the Welfare Commissioner and defines his powers and duties Section authorises <ORG> to make rules to carry out the purposes of this Act Rules were framed by the State of Bombay in exercise of the powers conferred by and they were published on June Payment of fines and of unpaid accumulations by employer I Within fifteen days from the date on which the Act shall come into force in any area every employer in such area shall pay by cheque money order or cash to the Welfare Commissioner a all fines realised from the employees before the said date and remaining unutilized on that date and all unpaid accumulations held by the employer on the aforesaid date Notice for payment of fines and unpaid accumu lations by Welfare Commissioner The Welfare Commissioner may after making such enquiries as he may deem fit and after calling for a report from the Inspector if necessary serve a notice on any employer to pay any portion of fines realised from the employees or unpaid accumulations held by him which the employer has not paid in accordance with rule To this the appellant sent a reply on the same date impugning the validity of the Act as being in violation of the provisions of Art The learned Chief Justice was of the opinion that on its true construction the Act merely substituted the <ORG> as a creditor in the place of the employees that there was no taking of property and that in consequence there was no contravention of Art <NAME> hold that unpaid wages were unquestionably moneys which belonged to the employer and that he was being deprived of them but there was no taking of possession or acquisition of property within a and of of the Act are void as contravening the provisions of the Constitution but to decide it we have to consider quite a number of questions which have been raised and discussed in the arguments before us Mr <NAME> is therefore clearly right in his contention that the liability of the appellant to pay wages to the employees does not ipso facto extinguish its title to the moneys belonging to it even pro tanto and that the effect therefore of is to take away money belonging to it would apply only if there was a transfer of title to or beneficial interest in the amounts to the <ORG> that effected neither that it did deprive the employers of oheir moneys but that fell under Art and that a law which produced those results must in order to be valid satisfy the conditions laid down in that Article It is as follows Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property There is considerable authority in America that the power of eminent domain does not extend to the taking of money the reason being that compensation which is to be paid in respect of money can only be money and that therefore in substance it is a forced loan It is argued for the respondents that the position under Art and includes money and that the citizens have the right to hold money subject only to law such as is saved by Art There was some discussion before us as to the scope of this provision the point of the debate being whether the words imposing reasonable restriction would cover a legislation which not merely regulated the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Art if the word restriction was to be narrowly construed and that accordingly the power to restrict must be held to include in appropriate cases the power to prohibit the exercise of the right That view does find support in the observations of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> but the present legislation cannot be sustained even on the above interpretation of the word restriction as of the Act deals with moneys and money cannot be likened to diseased cattle or noxious drugs so as to attract the exercise of police power under Art the impugned Act cannot be upheld and it must be struck down unless we accept the other contentions which have been urged for the respondents in support of its validity Counsel for the appellant contends that there are in the Act no words of transfer of the debts to the <ORG> and that there is only a provision for payment of the amounts But this is taking too narrow a view of the true scope of those provisions On this the question arises for consideration whether a debt which is time barred can be the subject of transfer and if it can be how it can benefit the <ORG> to take it over if it cannot be realised by process of law And the authorities have held and rightly that when the property is incapable of possession as for example a debt the section has no application and lapse of time does not extinguish the right of a person thereto When a debtor makes a payment without any direction as to how it is to be appropriated the creditor has the right to appropriate it towards a barred debt A similar provision is again enacted in the second proviso to sub of that unpaid accumulations and fines shall be paid to the <ORG> notwithstanding anything contained in the Payment of Wages Act or any other law for the time being in force the <ORG> <ORG> can enact a law modifying the Central Act provided it is reserved for consideration by the President and assented to by him and that has been done in the present case Coming to the impugned Act there is one other provision therein to which reference must be made This is a provision which is generally made when amounts are due and payable to the <ORG> and Mr <NAME> concedes that if the impugned law is otherwise valid it cannot be said to be bad by reason of this section The Act does not contain any provision to that effect and the absence thereof has been strongly relied on by the appellant as showing that no substitution of creditors was intended Section vi defines wages in terms which comprehend whatever falls within the definition of that word in of the impugned Act There is a proviso to this section that an application thereunder can be made after the period prescribed therein when the applicant satisfies the authority that he had sufficient cause for not making the application within such period Section of the Act provides that No Court shall entertain any suit for the recovery of wage or of any deduction from wages in so far as the sum so claimed could have been recovered by an application under section To this the reply of the respondents is that as on the terms of and the second proviso to they are to take effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Wages Act or any other law they override the power conferred by the proviso to of the Wages Act or the provisions of the Limitation Act Even as regards of the Wages Act there is divergence of judicial opinion as to its true scope In <ORG> <NAME> it was held that if there was any bona fide dispute as to the amount payable the jurisdiction of <ORG> was not barred by It is next contended that even if the impugned Act does not protect the employer in respect of unpaid wages which fall outside the Wages Act it should be upheld in so far as it relates to those claims which fall within the purview of that Act as the bar of limitation under of that Act is sufficient safeguard to the employer against being made liable at the instance of the employees for wages which had been paid to the Board It is contended for the respondents that when the subject matter of a law comprehends distinct matters as to some of which it is unconstitutional and bad it should nevertheless be upheld as regards the others if those others form a distinct category and that this principle applies not only when a classification into distinct categories appears on the face of the law but also when it exists in fact Under that Act there is no period of limitation prescribed for referring a dispute for adjudication by a tribunal Even when a claim for wages falls within the purview of the Wages Act and an application under of that Act would be barred it can nevertheless give rise to an industrial dispute in respect of which action can be taken under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act Here there is no question of finding out an implied term agreed to by the parties embodying a provision for discharge because the parties did not think about the matter at all nor could possibly have any intention regarding it This may be called a rule of construction by English Judges but it is certainly not a principle of giving effect to the intention of the parties which underlies all rules of construction Under this section the employer is liable to make compensation to the employee for the work done by him and that liability can be enforced against him in spite of the fact that he has paid the unclaimed wages to the <ORG> under of the Act A contention was also raised on behalf of the appellant that even if the impugned Act did not encroach on any of the Constitutional rights of the appellant it clearly violated the rights of the employees in that it deprives them of their right to wages earned by them that it was therefore void as against them as being in contravention of Art It is then argued that this is an objection open only to the employees and that the appellant can make no grievance of it It is no doubt true that a question as to the constitutionality of a statute can be raised only by a person who is aggrieved by it but here the statute deals with rights arising out of contract and that presupposes the existence of at least two parties with mutual rights and obligations and it is difficult to see how when the rights of one party to it are interfered with those of the other can remain unaffected by it What is there to prevent the employee from suing to recover the same amount from the appellant on the ground that the Act is unconstitutional It will be no answer to that claim to plead that the appellant has already paid the amount to the <ORG> That would be the correct position if the character of the legislation is what the respondents claim it to be for it is only a person who has some interest in property that can complain that the impugned legislation invades that right whether it be under Art and if it is abandoned property ex hypothesi there is no one who has any interest in it There is however this distinction between the two classes of property that while the <ORG> becomes the owner of the properties of a person who dies intestate as his ultimate heir it merely takes possession of property which is abandoned The validity of this law was questioned on the ground that sufficient opportunity had not been given to the depositors to claim the deposits and that as they could attack the law as unconstitutional the <ORG> got no protection by payment to the <ORG> In repelling this contention <ORG> observed that the Act did not deprive the depositors of any of their rights they being given ample opportunity to establish their rights and that it merely substituted the <ORG> in the place of the <ORG> as their debtor It provided that if those amounts had remained unclaimed for a period of seven years then it had to be advertised by the companies in the manner provided therein and if no claims were preferred thereafter the amounts were to be paid to the <ORG> Comptroller for care and custody In holding that the law was valid the Court observed There is ample provision for notice to beneficiaries and for administrative and judicial hearing of their claims and payment of same There is no possible injury to any beneficiary There was a provision for notice to the unknown owners by advertisement The period of three years mentioned in of the Act is merely the period of limitation mentioned in Art A more serious objection to viewing the legislation as one relating to abandoned claims is that there is no provision made in the Act for investigating the claims of the employees or for payment of the amounts due to them if they established their claims We have now to deal with the question as to the validity of and a of the Act which require the employers to hand over to the <ORG> the fines realised from the employees Now the grievance of the appellant is that the Act deprives it of its rights as trustees and vests them in the <ORG> and that further while the beneficiaries under of the Wages Act are its own employees under of the impugned Act they include otherpersons as well But then the trust is the creation not of the appellant but of the <ORG> which gave the employees certain rights which they did not have before and what it can give it can also take away or modify and we do not see how the employers are aggrieved by it The appeal succeeds in part but as it is stated that unpaid accumulations form by far the most substantial portion of the claim we direct the respondents to pay half the costs of the appellant here and in the <ORG> below Appeal allowed in part
