By Section the Special Judge is empowered to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons he is required to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure in the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates Section A empowers the Special Judge to try certain offences in a summary way and the provisions of Section to of the Criminal Procedure Code are made applicable so far as they may apply Section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act specifically empowers the Special Judge to take cognizance of the offence without the accused being committed to him for trial provides that no Court of Sessions Judge shall take cognizance for any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code Thus read there can be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the Criminal Procedure Code is applicable when there is no conflict with the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act A Magistrate other than a Magistrate having jurisdiction cannot keep him in custody for more than days and after the expiry of the period if the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case does not include Special Judge it would mean that he would have no authority to extend the period of remand or to release him on bail So also if the Special Judge is not held to be a Magistrate having jurisdiction a charge sheet under cannot be submitted to him The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The question that arises in this appeal is whether the Special Judge under the Criminal Law Amendment Act can exercise the power conferred on a Magistrate under section of the Criminal Procedure Code to authorise detention of the accused in the custody of the police This appeal by certificate is preferred by the State of Tamil Nadu against an Order of <ORG> in Ps Nos and of dated In order to appreciate the contention raised in this appeal it is necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of and the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Act of Section of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other law the offence specified in sub section of Section shall be triable by a Special Judge only By section therefore the jurisdiction to try offences mentioned in Section is conferred on the Special Judge only The Special Judge is empowered under this section i to take cognizance of offence without the accused being committed to him for trial and ii in trying the accused persons he is required to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure in the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates The Special Judge is empowered to take cognizances of the offences without the accused being committed to him for trial The jurisdiction to try the offence by a Sessions Judge is only after committal to him The Special Judge is deemed to be a Court of Sessions only for certain purposes as mentioned in Section of the Act while the first part of sub section provides that except as provided in sub sections and of Section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before the Special Judge The sub section further provides that for the purpose of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be a Court of session trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a special judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor The deemed provisions has to be confined for the purposes mentioned in the subsection Section enables the Special Judge to tender a pardon to a person with a view to obtaining evidence supposed to have been concerned for the commission of an offence and the pardon so tendered was for the purposes of Section and a of the Code of Criminal Procedure This provision also is made speciffically applicable to the Special Judge Section A empowers the Special Judge to try certain offences in a summary way and the provisions of section to of the Criminal Procedure Code is made applicable so far as they may apply It will be thus seen that section empowers the Special Judge to take cognizance of offence without committal and directs that in trying the accused persons it shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure should be considered to be in force unless there are certain provisions in the Criminal Law Amendment Act which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code We will now examine the provisions of Section of the Criminal Procedure Code The Magistrate to whom the accused is forwarded if he is not the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case may authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as he thinks fit for a term not exceeding days on the whole If he has no jurisdiction to try the case and if he considers that further detention is necessary he may order the accused to be forwarded to any Magistrate having jurisdiction The Magistrate having jurisdiction may authorise the detention of the accused person otherwise than in custody of the police beyond the period of days but for a total period not exceeding days In the present case the accused were produced before the Special Judge who admittedly is the person who has jurisdiction to try the case The contention which found favour with <ORG> is that the words Magistrate having jurisdiction cannot apply to a Special Judge having jurisdiction to try the case No doubt the word Special Judge is not mentioned in section but the question is whether that would exclude the Special Judge from being a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case It is seen that there are certain sections which require the police to take directions from the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case Section requires that no police shall take up non cognizable case without an order of the Magistrate having power to try such case or commit the case for trial provides that no Court of Sessions Judge shall take cognizance for any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code Thus read there could be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the Cr is applicable when there is no conflict with the provisions of Criminal Law Amendment Act A Magistrate other than a Magistrate having jurisdiction cannot keep him in custody for more than days and after the expiring of the period if the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case does not include the Special Judge it would mean that he would have no authority to extend the period of remand or to release him on bail So also if the Special Judge is not held to be a Magistrate having jurisdiction a charge sheet under section cannot be submitted to him This <ORG> in construing rule made under section of the Criminal Procedure Code held that the rule was applicable to only a Magistrate and not to a Special Judge who is not a Magistrate within the meaning of rule Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers <ORG> to make rules as to cases to which persons subject to military naval or air force shall be tried by the <ORG> to which this Code applies or by a <ORG> martial <ORG> made rules in exercise of the powers conferred on it under this section The learned Judge was in error in applying the decision of this <ORG> relating to rule which is framed under section to section of the we have no hesitation in coming to a conclusion that a Special Judge would be a Magistrate empowered to try a case under section of the The Special Judge will proceed to exercise the powers that are conferred upon a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case The appeal is allowed and the order of <ORG> set aside
