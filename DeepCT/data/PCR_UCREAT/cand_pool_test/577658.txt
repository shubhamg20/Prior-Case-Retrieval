The plaintiff instituted these suits between the th and th days of September as found by the Subordinate Judge having been born according to his own case on the th September He thus delayed to bring the suit until a few days before the expiry of three years from the date when he says he attained majority viz the plaintiff filed in <ORG> an affidavit Exhibit A in which he stated that he had attained majority on th September having been born on the th September The petition was not opposed by <NAME> his adoptive mother and next friend and he was accordingly brought on record as a major There are documents as the Subordinate Judge observes which show that the plaintiff must have been born after the th July and before the th September but this again is not enough As regards the plaintiff own statement in evidence and in the affidavit Exhibit A the Subordinate Judge does not appear to question its admissibility and it would appear to be admissible under Section read with Section of the Indian Evidence Act if made by a person having special means of knowledge and It appears to be settled that such knowledge need not be personal knowledge but may be derived from hearsay But even if admissible the statement of the party himself at the trial would be of very little weight if it were not supported by his statement in Exhibit A made ante litem motam at a time when the plaintiff had no interest in representing himself as younger than he was A European may be presumed to know his own birthday as a matter of course but it is denied that there is any such presumption in the case of Hindus of this class and his natural mother apparently did not remember it In this view it is unnecessary to discuss the evidence on the main issue and I will only say that the established facts that the plaintiff was charged in Exhibit II an account between the plaintiff and the A A branch with the cost of the village and that he has always paid poruppu on it raise a presumption in his favour which I am inclined to think has not been satisfactorily met As regards Appeal No of and the Memoranda of Objections in these appeals I agree with the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> He now sues to recover it The st defendant also pleads that as at the date of the suit the plaintiff was more than years of age the suit is barred by limitation It is conceded by the plaintiff that the second village covered by Exhibit IV was given away by <NAME> to another temple <ORG> There was considerable discussion regarding its admissibility I have given the other village called Pannipullam to the Kandadevi Devastanam Section of the Indian Evidence Act Mr <NAME> relied on has no application In <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Ch Ch <NAME> Master of the Rolls says It is no doubt an established rule in the Courts of this country that an entry against the interest of the man who made it is receivable in evidence after his death for all purposes that it must be prima facie against his interest that is to say the natural meaning of the entry standing alone must be against the interest of the man who made it cellor Hall introduced a qualification to the effect that in order to be admissible as a declaration against interest the entry must I take it be one which under no circumstances could operate for the advantage or benefit of the party who made it IN this state of authorities the question came up for consideration before <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> <NAME> <ORG> I Rep The statement which was sought to be put in related to the acknowledgment of paternity and a promise made by the deceased to marry the mother of the child who claimed compensation under the Workman Compensation Act as a dependent on the deceased Lord Justice <NAME> after making an incidental observation that as between the dicta of <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> that the statement must be one which never could be made available for the person himself and that of <NAME> <NAME> that it is sufficient that the statement is prima facie against the interest of the person making it he was inclined to the former view if there is any real difference between them proceeds to lay down categorically the tests of admissibility of statements against interest It was undoubtedly against the proprietary interest of the person making it In this view it seems to me that the statement Exhibit VIII is a very valuable piece of evidence in this case Was she inimical when her husband died There is absolutely no evidence to support this suggestion On the other hand the fact that at this time the widow took Exhibit III to evidence the assignment of Vengalur and Exhibit for the assignment of the lease right in the Devastanam villages negatives ill will and shows that the village was given up without any document because there was no proprietary interest in it There is no evidence whether this sum included the price paid for the purchase There is no satisfactory explanation for introducing the name of the temple accountant if the village was not an endowment Non constant that it would not include properties held by him on trust My surmise is that <NAME> wanted to have the credit of being the donor of this property to the Kandadevi temple seeing that his pangali endowed <NAME> with property worth four times as much and agreed to debit himself with the cost of its purchase unfortunately all the persons who could speak to what took place at or about are dead I agree with the Subordinate Judge on this question The plaintiff has to prove that he was within time when he instituted the suit He relies on Exhibit A an affidavit made by him in September in which he gives his date of birth as the th September It can have no higher value It is not independent evidence Now on examining Exhibit A the first thing that strikes one is the laboured particularity of the statements contained in it Ordinarily an affidavit would state that a man was born in a particular year and that he attained majority on the date of the application Then there is a statement that the natural mother and elder brother gave him information about the date of his birth The natural mother was examined and she was not asked whether she gave any such information It is true that there is no explanation on the defendants side for the plaintiff having made these statements if they are false in this affidavit As regards the horoscope Exhibit I have not the slightest hesitation in holding that it is altogether unreliable we have the authority of <ORG> in support of its admissibility But I think Mr <NAME> is fight in contending that the party making it must have had special means of knowledge There is nothing to show that the father of No had any special means of knowledge There is also the evidence of the st defendant I would dismiss the appeal with costs of respondents Nos to There was no document on that date Five years after the assignment in Exhibit III was executed by the st defendant in which reference is made to his liability to pay <NAME> for I see no difficulty in accepting the explanation of the st defendant in the witness box which bears the impress of truth on it and is in accordance with the probabilities The appeal must be dismissed with costs
