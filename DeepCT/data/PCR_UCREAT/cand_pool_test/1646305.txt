Whether under the Hindu law as administered in the Bengal school a widow who has once inherited the estate of a deceased husband is liable to forfeit that estate by reason of unchastity and nd <ORG> consisted of the Chief Justice and nine other Judges and the majority held that the widow having once inherited the estate did not forfeit it by reason of her subsequent unchastity Mr Justice <NAME> Mr Justice <NAME> and Mr Justice <NAME> dessented from the opinions expressed by the majority of the <ORG> The subject has been very elaborately discussed by the Chief Justice and the other Judges of <ORG> and it has also been fully argued before their Lordships on behalf of the appellant That case was originally tried before Mr Justice <NAME> who delivered a judgment in which he showed much research and great knowledge of the subject He draws a distinction between a widow and a son and says The theory of the Hindu law of inheritance is the capability by the heir of performing certain religious ceremonies which do good to the soul of the departed and he takes who can render most service sic childless widow keeping unsullied the bed of her lord and abiding with her venerable protector enjoy with moderation the property until her death In this view the text would run thus The widow of a childless man having kept unsullied her husband bed and persevered in religious observances shall obtain his entire share and present his funeral oblation It is important to see for what purpose the text was cited and with that view to refer to the verses immediately preceding those in which the text is cited for there is nothing more likely to mislead than to read a single paragraph from the Dayabhaga or <NAME> alone without studying the whole chapter and in some cases even without studying the several chapters of the same treatise And then in support of that proposition he refers to the second text cited and proceeds Thus <NAME> says Let the childless widow preserving unsullied the bed of her lord and abiding with her venerable protector enjoy with moderation the property until her death The participial form of the word preserving i continually preserving which is also the form used in the original palayanti proves conclusively that the injunction is one in the nature of a permanently abiding condition which a widow is bound at all times and under all circumstances to satisfy and the right of enjoyment conferred upon her being expressly declared to be subject to such a condition every violation of it must necessarily involve a forfeiture of right Mr Justice <NAME> also at page expresses a similar opinion and he refers to the present participle preserving as denoting continuance and as referring to the time after the widow has taken the property originally and he adds besides if the words keeping unsullied refer only to past time what is to be made of the other part which he assumes to import a condition viz Referring to that decision Mr Justice <NAME> says that it lends in an indirect way considerable support to his view inasmuch as that particular case was decided expressly upon the ground that the widow had not changed her residence for unchaste purposes Now how has <NAME> dealt with this particular text It has been seen for what purpose he cited it but how does he comment on it in the rest of the section in which it occurs He comments on the words venerable protector But he nowhere says one word from which it can be inferred that in his opinion the text implied continued chastity as a condition for the duration of her estate or that a breach of chastity subsequent to the death of her husband would operate as a forfeiture of her right The right to receive maintenance is very different from a vested estate in property and therefore what is said as to maintenance cannot be extended to the case of a widow estate by succession Mr Justice <NAME> in order to get rid of the argument that a daughter becoming a sonless widow or unchaste after having succeeded to the estate of her father does not forfeit the estate argues that the texts to which he refers are applicable to a daughter as well as to a widow and he refers to Sec It seems clear however that though an unchaste daughter is excluded from inheriting her father estate or an unchaste mother that of her son it is not by virtue of either of the above mentioned texts of <NAME> or that of <NAME> The words his funeral oblation and his share and the property have reference to the oblation the share and the property of the lord or husband mentioned in the preceding parts of the texts whose estate is to be inherited and not to the husband or lord whose estate is not to be inherited such as the husband or lord of a daughter or mother as the case may be of the deceased owner who in default of a widow may be next in succession to inherit his estate This is made clear by Section in which it is said Since it has been shown by a text cited Sec I that on the decease of the widow in whom the succession had vested the legal heirs of the former owner who would regularly inherit his property if there were no widow in whom the succession vested namely the daughters and the rest succeed to the wealth therefore the same Rule concerning the succession of the former possessor next heirs is inferred a fortiori in the case of the daughter and grandson meaning a daughter son whose pretensions are inferior to the wife Then comes Section which is in the words following The word wife in the text above quoted Sec The general rule is stated in the Viramitrodaya a book of authority in Southern India see Moore Indian Appeals and Mr <NAME> Preface to the Dayabhaga and which may also like the Mitakshara be referred to in Bengal in cases where the Dayabhaga is silent the exclusion again of these takes place if their disqualification occur previously to partition or succession but not if subsequently to partition or succession for there is no authority for the resumption of allotted shares He said In the case of <NAME> <NAME> Moore I A it was held that a decree in a suit brought by a Hindu widow binds the heirs who claim in succession to her but that can only be in a suit brought by her so long as she holds a widow estate It would cause infinite confusion if a decree in a suit brought by a widow could be avoided if it could be shown that she had committed an act of unchastity before she commenced the suit Upon the whole then their Lordships after careful consideration of this question and of the authorities bearing upon it have come to the conclusion that the decision of the majority of the Judges was the correct one and it is important to remark that <ORG> at Bombay in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Bom
