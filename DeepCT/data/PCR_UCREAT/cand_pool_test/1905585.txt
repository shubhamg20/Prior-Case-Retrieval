The short facts which have given rise to this petition are as under <ORG> which was running a cotton textile unit at the present site was closed down in October and winding up petition was presented before this <ORG> on March It was in terms stated that the <ORG> had agreed to give possession of the land building and fixed assets leased to it by February but it was allowed to work the mill in order to clear the goods in process and after stopping processes gradually the entire possession of the whole mill would be delivered to the petitioner on or before April It was further agreed that the <ORG> shall pay to the petitioner <ORG> compensation for use and occupation at the rate of Rs The petitioner therefore for its new concern claimed the infancy benefits and when a dispute had arisen in that connection the petitioner approached <ORG> to resolve that doubt or dispute under A of the Act It is this order which is challenged by the petitioner company in the present petition In view of the settled legal position which would be immediately referred the representative union adopted the safer and wiser course of settling this matter by collective bargaining with the employer and accordingly a registered agreement has been arrived at in pursuance to the notice of change in this connection of October Before we go into that question we will consider the whole question on merits as per the settled legal position Section A iv provides that if any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act and in particular if any doubt arises as to the number of years which have elapsed from date on which an establishment has been set up <ORG> may by order make such provision or give such direction not inconsistent with the provision of this Act as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for the removal of the doubt or difficulty and the order of <ORG> in such cases shall be final In this connection we may also refer to one more section viz which provides that notwithstanding anything contained in which provides in clause a that subject to the provisions contained in it applies a to every establishment which is a factory engaged in any industry specified in Schedule I and in which twenty or more persons are employed or what is contained even in the infancy benefit provision of the Act can be made applicable to the establishment by a notification in the official Gazette if it appears to <ORG> on the application made to it or otherwise that the employer and the majority of employees in relation to the establishment have agreed that the provisions of the Act be made applicable to such an establishment It was further pointed out at pages that there was no delegation of the legislative power in this connection as it was quasi judicial function which was delegated to <ORG> and therefore the <ORG> had not abdicated its function At page I had pointed out the historical setting of A which was introduced in the Act by the amendment Therefore this expert body which was entrusted with the task of extending the Act progressively to various industries and establishments was also entrusted with this statutory function of resolving doubt and difficulties particularly in respect of these five statutory issues under A so that the act would not remain a dead letter and it would be expeditiously implemented It was therefore held even in this <ORG> decision that this was quasi judicial decision which resulted in a declaratory judgment resolving the dispute as to certain relevant facts or the questions between the parties by removing doubt or difficulty which existed The relevant doubt may be as to whether a particular factory or establishment was covered under Schedule I or under the relevant notification under or whether twenty or more persons were employed by such establishment or as to the number of years which have elapsed from the date on which an establishment has been set up or whether the total quantum of benefit to which an employee is entitled had been reduced by the employer Therefore it is in the light of this settled legal position that this decision under A is a quasi judicial decision which has to be arrived at by <ORG> as per the relevant guidelines that we have to examine the present question This precise language covers both the cases whether the establishment was new or whether the establishment was old Therefore if this was the case of an old establishment the period of exemption for the purpose of applying of the Act would run from the date on which the old establishment had been set up and could not be counted from the date when the petitioner company set up this establishment If however this was the new establishment set up by the petitioner company it would be entitled to have the benefit of the infancy protection from the date it has set up the new establishment The conclusion on facts which was arrived at by their Lordships was as stated at page that at the time of the purchase a new owner came in place of previous owner the work of the <ORG> was stopped on sale and was restarted after a break of about three months the machinery in the <ORG> was also altered the persons employed previously were not continued in service while a fresh recruitment of the employees took place amongst whom only six happened to be previous employees and compensation was paid to the workmen at the time of the sale On these facts their Lordships held that no other conclusion could be drawn except that the old establishment was completely closed when the transfer of ownership took place and an entirely new establishment was set up three months later so that in this case an infancy benefit under of the Act was available to this newly set up concern from the date when the new establishment was set up The earlier decision in <ORG> <ORG> Punjab I was distinguished on the ground that there it was a mere change in the location of the establishment or a change in the line business which would not have the effect that a new establishment had been set up provided there was continuity of working It was further held that the decision in <ORG> could not apply to the case before their Lordships where there was no continuity of the business and there were the additional factors of termination of services of all the workmen and new establishment being set up by a fresh recruitment of workmen in addition to alteration of machinery in the <ORG> Various decisions of <ORG> were considered by their Lordships which were distinguished on their own facts and one of the grounds relied on by their Lordships was that the case was of transfer of business which was run under licences and those licences were also transferred by the seller to the purchaser and therefore it was held in that decision by <ORG> that it was a case of sale of a going concern and there was continuity of business Their Lordships distinguished this decision on the short ground that there was a finding that it was a case of a transfer of a going concern while the case before their Lordships revealed that the old concern was closed and was restarted as a new business after recruiting new workmen Applying this correct principle their Lordships held that the only possible conclusion was that <ORG> had set up a new establishment and it was entitled to infancy protection The question of continuity will have to be examined not merely from the fact that it is the same site or part of the machinery is the same machinery or even the employees are the old employees Further the conditions which are agreed by all the parties concerned including even the official liquidator are that the <ORG> shall discharge all the workers clerks staff members and officers by paying them all their legal dues Therefore not only so far as the employer is concerned it is totally a new concern which has severed all connection with the old company and the <ORG> but in so far as the employees are concerned there is not an iota of evidence for showing any continuity either with the old concern or with <ORG> because they had accepted employment only as fresh recruits with the petitioner company Besides a very significant fact to be borne in mind is that so far as the old mill company was concerned even the Investigation Committee under <ORG> had recommended it to be the scrapped Their Lordships in <ORG> case had approved the principle so succinctly laid down by the learned single Judge of the Madras High <ORG> in <NAME> case supra Here rightly there was no suggestion that this was not a case of genuine and real closure of business both by the old company which was wound up and by the <ORG> which went out on the expiry of the lease The grounds which have been relied upon by <ORG> make no reference to this settled legal position even though admittedly this decision was cited at the hearing before the authority which decided this matter The first reason given in the impugned order is that the old establishment which was restarted on February had continued to function when it was taken over by the petitioner company It is true that after the lease expired time was given under the order of the <ORG> to the <ORG> to enable it to clear the goods in the process The infancy benefit is granted to the new establishments to give them breathing time and therefore whenever the old establishment dies giving rise to a new establishment the question of a fresh infancy benefit would always arise and it is wholly irrelevant in that context that infancy benefit granted to the <ORG> which ran the concern under a lease from the liquidator Therefore this ground is totally irrelevant and misconceived and proceeds on a confusion that this was a mere change of ownership and management when really it was a change in the entire identity of the employer who had no continuity with the old employer and which would therefore give rise to a totally new establishment It also recites the fact that it was a new employer who was coming in existence on purchase of all movables and immovable assets of the company There a company called <ORG> carried on business of manufacturing textiles in their mills known as <ORG> The learned single Judge held that the Act was made applicable to factories and not to the owners thereof or in other words it applied to factories irrespective of who the owners from time to time might be The learned Judge further held that the question was whether the order of liquidation and the consequent temporary discontinuance of business until a lease was granted to <NAME> and Company had the consequence of making the factory which was established ceased to be established and the answer of the learned Judge was in the negative The learned single Judge took it that the establishment of a factory involved that the factory had gone into production and no more But once it went into production a temporary cessation of its activities for whatever reasons that cessation took place could not take the factory out of the category of an established factory for the purposes of the Act In any event the Act was a beneficial legislation for the benefit of the employees and every construction of its provisions which would defect the object of the legislation and lead to an to an evasion must be rejected unless the clear language of the Act left no option to the <ORG> but to accept such an interpretation While resolving this doubt or difficulty it can take into consideration such beneficial settlement of a collective dispute as ultimately it is the employees who are going to be affected by the decision of <ORG> when the infancy benefit is granted to the petitioner company by adjudication under A In view of the settled legal position if the representative union had appeared before <ORG> and compromised this hopeless claim the authorities would have surely given effect to this compromise which was in the best interest of the employees It is the representative union which has to deliver the goods to the employees That decision is hardly relevant in the present context because it proceeds in terms on the footing that the decision of <ORG> not to enforce the provisions of the Act was only a provisional decision because <ORG> had at that time taken the view that the Act did not apply to that activity Once that view was overruled by their Lordships and the legal position was settled there being no final decision under A there was no question of any res judicata or any estoppel against the statute As earlier pointed out in terms enacts that notwithstanding anything contained in sub of or if the employer and the majority of employees in relation to any establishment have agreed that the provisions of the Act should be made applicable to that establishment <ORG> can make the Act applicable to that establishment by a notification in the official <ORG> Such a direction on the facts of such a particular case can include direction under that this collective agreement having been arrived at with the representative union which under the present State Industrial law means all the employees in this concern it should be made applicable to the establishment by a proper notification under in the official <ORG> This would not in any way affect the mandatory nature of the provisions in for the <ORG> would ordinarily have to publish the award but for the special situation arising in such cases Where however a settlement was arrived at between the parties to dispute before a <ORG> after the award had been submitted to the <ORG> but before its publication there was in fact no dispute left to be resolved by the publication of the award In this result we would allow this petition Rule is accordingly made absolute with no order as to costs in the circumstances of the case
