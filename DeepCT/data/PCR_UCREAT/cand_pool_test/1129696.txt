It is to be noted that the writ petition filed by the respondent was dismissed by a learned Single Judge and the same was challenged in the Letters Patent Appeal The respondent filed statutory complaint on for setting aside the ACRs of and The respondent made second statutory complaint which was also rejected on The respondent filed writ petition No of before the Delhi High Court praying therein that a writ of mandamus be issued to the appellants herein to promote him or in the alternative he be assessed afresh by <ORG> and for setting aside ACRs <ORG> after going through the records of the case came to the conclusion that there was an adverse element in the ACRs of the respondent for the years and and therefore in the terms of letter dated of the Sena Sachiv Shakha no The fundamental mistake in the approach of <ORG> is that it proceeded on the basis as if whenever there was allotment of marks at a figure lower than for the previous period it was down gradation resulted in adverse consequences and ought to have been communicated before the same was considered while considering the respondent suitability for promotion Since there was no challenge in the writ petition to the effect that there were no parameters for assessment <ORG> ought not to have introduced a fresh case of absence of parameters Additionally the ACR for was recorded when the respondent was holding the post of Major while for the previous period he was holding the post of Captain The question of any communication did not arise because there was no adverse entry as such As there was no averment that parameters did not exist in the counter filed present appellants did not touch on that aspect In response learned counsel for the respondent submitted that <ORG> has taken the correct view considering the fact that serious consequences were involved and directed communication of the entry which had adverse consequences The reduction in marks for a subsequent period is a clear case of adverse consequences and therefore it was correct on the part of <ORG> to give direction as contained in the impugned order It was also submitted that the Jal Nigam case supra clearly points out that when there is a down grading in the assessment by award of lesser marks adverse consequences are involved As has been rightly submitted by learned counsel for the appellants <ORG> case supra has no universal application Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated To interpret words phrases and provisions of a statute it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define Judges interpret statutes they do not interpret judgments They interpret words of statutes their words are not to be interpreted as statutes This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished judge It will require qualification in new circumstances The following words of Lord <NAME> in the matter of applying precedents have become locus classicus Each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect in deciding such cases one should avoid the temptation to decide cases as said by <NAME> by matching the colour of one case against the colour of another There are different officers involved in the process they are Initiating Officer in short the I the Superior Reviewing Officer in short the the First Technical Officer in short the FTO and Higher Technical officer in short the HTO If there are no adverse advisory remarks reflected in the pen picture there is no requirement of including details of verbal or written guidance for improvement given to the ratees during the reporting period A reading of the instructions clearly indicate that there are different stages first is the counseling second is the guidance and third is the consequences of the officer failing to show desired improvement We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case as the matter is being remitted to <ORG> for fresh consideration
