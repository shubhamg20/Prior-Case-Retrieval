These two sales tax revision petitions are presented under section of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act by a registered dealer against the orders of <ORG> confirming the orders of the appellate and assessing authorities The only question of law that arises for consideration in these two revision petitions is as follows Whether the notification issued under section A of the Act exempting the purchase turnover of old gold and silver articles from the levy of sales tax under section of the Act became invalid with effect from st July with effect from which date sub section of section was amended enhancing the rate of tax payable on general goods from to per cent According to the assessee he was exempt from payment of sales tax under section of the Act by virtue of a notification issued under section A of the Act Aggrieved by the said orders the assessee preferred appeals to the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Appeals Mangalore Aggrieved by the said order the assessee preferred second appeals before <ORG> By common order dated th August the <ORG> confirmed the assessment made by the assessing authority both under sections and of the Act <NAME> the learned counsel for the assessee contended that in view of the notification issued by <ORG> under section A of the Act on th September the assessee was not liable to pay tax under section of the Act on the purchase turnover of articles of gold and silver The said notification reads In exercise of the powers conferred by section A of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act Karnataka Act of the Government of Karnataka hereby exempts with effect from the st day of October the tax payable under section of the said Act on the purchases of articles of gold and or silver whether set with precious stones or not by a manufactures of such articles subject to the condition that the said manufacturer proves to the satisfaction of the assessing authority that he has paid the tax payable either under sub section or clause a of sub section section of the said Act on articles of gold and silver whether set with precious stones or not manufactured of the said articles so purchased by him Section A of the Act confers power on <ORG> to reduce or exempt the tax payable under the Act by issue of a notification The learned counsel for the assessee however contended that the view taken by a single Judge of this Court in the said case is erroneous From the facts set out in the judgment it is seen that prior to th September the sales tax payable on the turnover pertaining to dyes was per cent vide entry of the Second Schedule to the Act The State Government issued a notification dated th September under section A of the Act by which the sales tax payable on the turnover relating to dyes was reduced to per cent By the Karnataka Sales Tax Amendment Act which came into force with effect from st April the sales tax payable on the turnover relating to dyes was enhanced from per cent to per cent Rejecting the claim of the assessee therein that the reduced rate of per cent was available even during the period from st April to st July it was held that as the legislature which was the highest legislative body amended the Act and declared that on and after st April the turnover relating to dyes would be subjected to a tax at a higher rate at per cent instead of the pre existing rate at per cent the notification issued by <ORG> under section A of Act became ineffective with effect from st April on the ground that it was inconsistent with the amending Act Applying the ratio of the said decision the <ORG> held that the notification dated th September exempting the tax on the purchase turnover of old gold and silver articles issued under section A of the Act also became ineffective with effect from st July In our opinion the learned counsel for the assessee is right in his submission that the view taken in the <NAME> case is erroneous Sub section Of section A of the Act confers power on <ORG> either to reduce the rate of tax payable on any goods under the Act or to exempt the tax payable on any specified goods under the Act by the issue of a notification to that effect Sub section of section A confers power on <ORG> to cancel or vary a notification issued under sub section by the issue of a notification Therefore a notification issued under section A of the Act either reducing the rate of tax or exempting the tax payable on any specified goods continues to be a in force until it is modified or cancelled by <ORG> by a notification issued under sub section of section A We are unable to agree with the view taken by the single Judge in the <NAME> case that notification issued under section A becomes invalid by the enhancement of rate of tax on the goods specified in the notification by any subsequent amending Act on the ground of inconsistency There is nothing in the amending Act of which could be considered as having affected the validity of the notification issued under section A of the Act We hold that the view taken by the single Judge in the <NAME> case is wrong and we overrule the said decision In conclusion we hold that the notification dated th September issued by <ORG> in exercise of its power under section A of the Act exempting the purchase turnover of old gold and silver articles from the levy of tax under section of the Act was not in any way affected by the amending Act of and continued to be in force As the assessee was clearly entitled to the benefit of exemption granted under the notification dated th September his turnover could not be brought to tax under section of the Act Consequently the orders of the first and second appellate authorities confirming the said orders also cannot be sustained
