We are informed that there is reason to believe that defendant No has since purchased the rights of defendant No In the plaintiff brought a suit upon the mortgage of against the heirs of the mortgagor and others The plaintiff opposed the application which was rejected by the <ORG> The plaintiffs then instituted the present suit on the th June The second ground which is the more substantial ground is that the defendants if they ever had any right to redeem are precluded from exercising that right by reason of the application which <NAME> made in the mortgage suit of But we have the order of the <ORG> on the petition passed on the th May The order begins in this way I have heard the Pleader for the plaintiff and the Pleader for the person who prays to be added as a defendant The plaintiff Pleader objects to the third party being joined as a defendant If that was the plea of <NAME> it is possible that if he had been made a party and the plea had been tried it would have proved unsuccessful in the event as it did in the case cited If therefore <NAME> had been permitted at his own instance to become a party defendant in the suit he might have filed a written statement putting forward both defences to the plaintiffs claim As a matter of fact however lie was not made a party he had no opportunity of filing a written statement or of stating his case in a formal way decided by <ORG> the defendant who claimed the right to redeem had been made a party to the mortgagee suit Having been a party to the suit and the suit having been dismissed as against him on the ground that as he claimed a paramount title he was not a proper party to the suit it was held that in the subsequent suit brought by the mortgagee for possession of the property it was too late for him then to set up a new title under which he would have the right of redemption <NAME> was not permitted to become a party to the mortgage suit and as I have said he had no opportunity in that suit to put forward the case that even if he failed to establish a paramount title he had at least a right which would entitle him to redeem the plaintiffs In paragraph of the plaint the plaintiffs say Particularly even if the defendant No or his predecessor <NAME> had any decree still the plaintiffs mortgage being preferential they had no right to retain the land of the schedule in their possession without redeeming the same In paragraph the plaintiffs say again If it is held that defendant No has any right to redeem any mortgage then he may be given the opportunity to pay what is justly due to the plaintiffs on account of their mortgage and if that opportunity he not availed then a decree for possession may be awarded to the plaintiffs There is nothing so far as I can see in what happened in the previous suit or in the conduct of the present suit by the defendants to debar them from this right of redemption to which on the facts found they are clearly entitled The result therefore is that this appeal is allowed the right of the defendants appellants to redeem the plaintiffs in respect of the property in dispute is declared and the case remitted to the Court of first instance for that Court to take the proper accounts determine the amount which the defendants should pay the plaintiffs for the purpose and make a decree accordingly The appellants are entitled to their costs of this appeal We make no order as to the costs in the <ORG> below
