The Board of Directors of the company created a trust and declared that all moneys standing in the <ORG> Account and realised on this account in future should be treated as trust fund and utilised by the trustees for such religious and charitable purposes as may be decided by them On reference <ORG> held that the amounts were never the income of the assessee that the assessee was merely acting as a clearing house for passing the amount to the trust that the fact that it was a compulsory levy did not make it a trade receipt that <ORG> was a customary levy prevailing in some parts of the country and where it was paid by the customers to a trading concern the amount was not paid as a price for the commodity sold to the customer In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the realisations being a compulsory levy they must be regarded as a part of the consideration or price of the goods purchased by the buyers and that gift for <ORG> was void for vagueness and uncertainty Though there is some justification for holding that a gift to Dharma simpliciter would be invalid on grounds of vagueness and uncertainty a gift to <ORG> would be definite the object being certain viz Similarly while the expression Dharma is idefinite and equivocal the expression Dharmarth has only one meaning viz Apart from the fact that the concept of <ORG> or <ORG>ya in common parlance means anything given in charity or for religious or charitable purposes among the trading or commercial community in various parts of this country a gift or payment for <ORG> is by custom invariably regarded a gift to charitable purposes Since a gift or payment for <ORG> is by commercial or trading custom invariably regarded as a gift for charitable purposes there is no question of there being any vagueness or uncertainty about the object for which such gift or payment has to be utilized The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR These three appeals are preferred on certificates of fitness granted by <ORG> under ss A of the Indian Income Tax Act They raise a common question whether the amounts realised by the assessee company from its customers as and or Dharmada during the three assessment years and are liable to be taxed as its income under the Act and the question arises in the following circumstances It carries on the business of manufacturing and selling yarn It appears that at a meeting of <ORG> of the assessee company held on January the Board passed a resolution that the moneys standing in the Dharmada Account be treated as trust fund of which <NAME> and <NAME> two Directors of the company be the trustees and it was further declared that all the money realised in future by the company on sale of yarn from the purchasers at the rate of one Anna per bale or such rate as may be decided in future be handed over to the trustees for being utilised in such altruistic religious and charitable purposes as may be decided upon by them and that the trustees shall in particular utilise such funds for the advancement of education and the alleviation of misery and sickness of the public in general as it think fit IN the assessment proceedings for the assessment years and the assessee claimed that the aforesaid amounts Lying to the credit of the <ORG> Account were held in trust by it and were ear marked for charity and as such they were not its income from business liable to tax and in support of this contention reliance was placed upon the resolution passed by <ORG> on January A and the Deed of Declaration of Trust dated October Before the <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the assessee that each customer who paid the <ORG> amount was a settlor of the trust that there were as many settlors as there were customers and that the assessee had receive these amounts under an obligation to utilise the same for charity it was pointed out that the resolution of <ORG> dated January was merely a confirmation of the fact that the amounts were held in trust by the assessee and that the deed dated October was merely a declaration of the acceptance of the trust by the two trustees mentioned therein in other words it was contended that the customers of the assessee created a trust by paying the amounts as <ORG> and the amounts having been ear marked for charitable purpose only they were not the assessee income liable to tax It took the view that the <ORG> erred in holding that the levy for Dharmada was in the nature of a surcharge on the price charged for sale of yarn and cotton and that in its opinion the fact that it was a compulsory levy ipso Facto did not impress the same with the character of a trading receipt It further observed that it was well known that the Dharmada was a customary levy prevailing in certain parts of the country and where it was paid by the customers to a trading concern the amount was not paid as price for the commodity sold to the customer Following this decision <ORG> answered the question raised in the latter Reference also in favour of the assessee Secondly he contended that it is well settled that a gift for Dharma or Dharmada is void for vagueness and uncertainty and therefore when the Dharmada amounts were paid by the customers and received by the assessee these amounts could not be regarded as property held under trust or other legal obligation for charitable purposes within the meaning of i of the Act and in this behalf strong reliance was placed upon the meanings given to the expressions Apart from this legal position he sought to support the <ORG> finding that no trust could be said to have been created by the customers on the basis of certain factual aspects a the customers paid the amounts not voluntarily but out of compulsion the customers being illiterate did not appreciate that they were paying the amounts with a view to create trust there was no control over the assessee as regards the manner in which and the time when it should spend for <ORG> and the assessee did not keep these amounts in a separate bank account separate from its business assets Having regard to the rival contentions noted above it seems to us clear that there are two aspects that are required to be considered fol determining the question raised in these appeals but in a sense the two aspects are so inter related that they would represent the two sides of the same coin The one aspect is what is the true nature or character these receipts whether they constitute a part of the price received by the assessee while effecting sales of yarn or cotton and are therefore trading receipts of the assessee The other aspect is whether these realisations are property held under trust or other legal obligation for charitable purposes or not And this depends upon whether the ear marking of these payments for Dharmada creates a valid trust of obligation to spend the same only on charitable objects But in the facts and circumstances of the case it is obvious that these receipts would not be trading receipts only if at the time these are received they are held under a trust or other legal obligation to spend the same for charitable purposes As pointed out earlier <ORG> approached the question from the angle of deciding whether the impugned amounts realised by the assessee could be regarded as the Profits and gains of the business carried on by the assessee under of the Act impliedly suggesting that a claim for exemption for such amounts under i of the Act was unnecessary or irrelevant and that the dispute merely related to the initial character of the receipt itself and following the decision in <ORG> case supra it held that the amounts in question which were paid by the customers ear marked for charity were not trading receipts and were never the income of the assessee at all It is clear that the while making this finding <ORG> assumed that the customers while paying these amounts had validly ear marked them for charity Therefore the first question that arises for our consideration is whether a gift to Dharmada is void on grounds of vagueness or uncertainly The answer to this question will depend upon what is the true meaning of the expression Dharmada and is the concept of Dharmada as vague or uncertain as the concept of Dharma The two allied concept of Dharma Anna Dharmada will have to the considered together <NAME> felt that in this country Dharma did mean roughly and almost invariable in the cases which had come up for legal decisions just charity and nothing else and observed It is true that an oriental idea of charity might be a little wider and looser than that of the Lord Eldon particularly amongst the lower and more illiterate classes of Hindus and I Bom It may be stated that with a view to give effect to the popular concept of the word Dharma a Bill was introduced being Bill No of published in the Gazette of India Part dated but it was presumably dropped as it fell under Religious and Charitable Endowments in List II of the Government of India Act which was a Provincial subject If the respective meanings of the two expressions Dharma and Dharmada as given in the above dictionaries are compared it will appear clear that that the former is indefinite and equivocal whereas the latter is quite definite the former means either law or virtue or legal duty or moral duty but the latter only means an endowment or gift for religious or charitable purpose From the above discussion it appears to us clear that though there is some justification for holding that a gift to Dharma simpliciter would be invalid on ground of vagueness and uncertainty a gift to Dharmada Dharmadaya would be definite the object being certain namely for religious or charitable purposes In common parlance therefore the expression Dharmada or Dharmadaya cannot be said to be vague or uncertain and as such a gift to harmada Dharmadaya would not be invalid for vagueness or uncertainty Counsel for the <ORG> however strongly relied upon the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> supra where that <ORG> has taken the view that a bequest in favour of Dharmada is void by reason of uncertainty After going through the arguments of counsel in that case and the decision of the <ORG> it appears to us clear that the <ORG> has accorded a literal and derivative meaning to the word Dharmada in that Dharmada means property set apart for Dharma and having regard to such derivative Meaning accorded to that expression the <ORG> has taken the view that there is no real distinction between a bequest to be expended on Dharmada and a bequest for Dharma <NAME> Glossary and Molesworth Dictionary an endowment or gift for religious or charitable purposes and we are inclined to accept the latter popular meaning that is invariably accorded by Orientalists to the expression Dharmada Dharmadaya and as such in our view a gift to Dharmada or payment for Dharmada must be regarded as a gift or payment for religious or charitable purposes and such a gift or payment would not be invalid for vagueness or uncertainty Apart from the fact that the concept of Dhramada or Dhramada in common parlance means anything given in charity or for religious or charitable purposes it cannot be disputed that among the trading or commercial community in various parts of this country a gift or payment for <NAME> is by custom invariably regarded as a gift to charitable purposes <ORG> took the view that in order to determine whether a particular receipt by whatever name it was called was or Was not the income The assessee specific case was that in the District of Shahjahanpur there was a custom according to which the commission agents realised <NAME> from their constituents and spent the same on charity and this specific case was not controverted by the <ORG> presumably because the <ORG> was aware that such a custom did obtain in the trading community It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the ownership of the fund realised by way of <NAME> rested entirely in the assessee who was free to spend the The question whether the position of the petitioner when he received the amount was that of a trustee or not will depend upon the actual custom which obliged the constituents to pay <ORG> In other words a gift or payment for Dharmada is by commercial or trading custom invariably regarded as a gift for charitable purposes and as such there is no question of there being any vagueness or uncertainty about the object for which such gift or payment has to be utilized The next aspect requiring consideration is whether because of the compulsory nature of the levy the impugned amounts charged to the customers and received by the assessee Could be regarded as a part of the price or a surcharge on the price as contended by the counsel for the <ORG> In our view this question is covered by the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> case supra In the case the respondent club conducted horse races with amateur riders and charged fees for admission into the enclosure of the club at the time of the races a resolution was passed in at the general body meeting of the club for levying a surcharge of eight annas over and above the admission fees the proceeds of which were to go to <ORG> this resolution was varied by another resolution dated January to the effect that the surcharge should be ear marked for local charities and not solely for <ORG> every entrant was issued two tickets one an admission ticket for admission to the enclosure of the club and the other a separate ticket in respect of the surcharge of eight annas for local charities the question was whether receipts on account of the surcharge were to be treated as the respondent income for the assessment year <ORG> and the High <ORG> on a reference held that the respondent receipts from the surcharge levied on admission tickets for purposes of charity could not be included in the respondent taxable income At page of the report this <ORG> has observed thus The surcharge is undoubtedly a payment which a race goer is required to make in addition to the price of admission ticket if he wants to witness the race from the Club enclosure but on that account it does not become part of the price for add mission The two decisions on which reliance was placed by counsel for the <ORG> namely <NAME> case supra and <NAME> case supra are clearly distinguishable and inapplicable to the facts of this case inasmuch as both the decisions were rendered under sales tax legislation where the question that was required to be considered was whether the realisations for Dharmam charitable purpose in the former case or Mahimai religious purpose in the latter case would fall within the definition of turnover as contained in the concerned legislation and it was held that such realisations were includible in the assessee turnover Further it is not possible to accept the submission that the customers being illiterate did not appreciate that they were paying the amounts with a view to create a trust especially when it has been found that such payments were made pursuant to a custom which obtained in the commercial and trading community indeed being a customary levy the constituents or customers whether literate or illiterate would be knowing that the additional payment over and above he price were meant for being spent by the assessee for charitable purposes Having regard to this position it seems to us clear that the <ORG> finding that no trust could be said to have been created by the customers in respect of the impugned amounts will have to be regarded as erroneous conclusion of <ORG> is therefore confirmed and the appeals are dismissed with costs
