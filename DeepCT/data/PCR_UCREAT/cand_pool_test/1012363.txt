This appeal raises a question as to the validity of the provisions for the shebaitship of certain Hindu idols made by the will of <NAME> who was a Hindu governed by <ORG> of Hindu law and who died on March <NAME> who tried the case upheld the contention of the present appellant by a judgment dated January On appeal this judgment was reversed by <NAME> and <NAME> who held that Clause can be construed as an intention to make an independent gift of the office for life to such person as happened to answer the description of eldest male lineal descendant at the date of the death retirement or refusal to act of <NAME> or <NAME> There is nothing whatever in the words of the grant to show that the estate so conferred was anything but an absolute estate upon such persons For there is nothing to suggest on the one hand that such estate was limited to their life or on the other that any line of descent was marked out after their death It was further argued for the respondents that even if no separable and independent gift to those who would take on the death retirement or refusal to act of <NAME> and <NAME> respectively it was still the duty of the <ORG> to give effect to the scheme of succession in so far as the person entitled to take under the scheme was in fact also the person who would take under the Hindu law of succession this being true in the case of <NAME> and <NAME> expressed by the words of his will which will be advanced by this process and we are not at liberty to invent for him a will which will have the effect of creating an estate at variance not merely in details but in substance and effect with what he has said There is no trace to be found in the will of an intention to create any other sort of estate and the will as clearly as language can speak without express words declares that it was not the intention of the <NAME> that any person to take thereunder should have the estate of inheritance defined by the ordinary law Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal should be allowed that the decree of <ORG> in its appellate jurisdiction dated July should be set aside except as to the costs in that appeal and that the decree of <ORG> in its original jurisdiction dated January so far as set aside by the above mentioned decree should be restored
