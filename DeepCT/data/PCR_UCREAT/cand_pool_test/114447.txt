This case has been referred to this Bench for a decision of the question whether in a Letters Patent appeal the time requisite for obtaining copies of the judgment and decree should be excluded in computing the period of limitation fixed by the Rules of this Court for preferring a Letters Patent Appeal The question which has been referred to this Bench is whether the time required for obtaining copies of the judgment and The relevant facts are that judgment in two connected second appeals was delivered by <NAME> on the learned Judge granting leave to the present appellants to file a further appeal under the Letters Patent His first contention is that the rules made by this Court under the Letters Patent constitute a special or local law within the meaning of Section Limitation Act and that accordingly the provisions of Section of that Act will apply for the purpose of determining the period of limitation Section as it now stands provides that Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply It is not in dispute that the first schedule to the Limitation Act does not provide a period of limitation for an appeal under the Letters Patent and assuming that the Rules made by this Court are a special or local law the first question is whether the provisions of Section have any application when a special or local law prescribes a period of limitation for an appeal for which BO period is prescribed in the first srhedulc The first part provides that Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period off limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule The purpose of this part of the sub section is I think sufficiently clear it is to resolve the difficulty which would otherwise arise where there is a difference between the period of limitation prescribed for a particular suit appeal or application by the first schedule to the Limitation Act and the period prescribed by the special or local law The sub section then provides that and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suite appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly ex cluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply and tne important question is whether these provisions apply only to those suits appeals and applications to which the first part of the sub section refers that is to those suits appeals and applications for which the special or local law prescribes a period of limitation different from that prescribed therefor by the first schedule or whether they are of general application and apply to all suits appeals and applications for which a period of limitation is prescribed by a special or local law The words used are for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law these are words of the widest amplitude and standing by themselves include every suit appeal and application for which a period of limitation is prescribed by a special or local law Had it been the intention of the <ORG> to limit the ambit of the provisions of this part of the sub section to those suits appeals and applications to which reference is made in the earlier part the appropriate words would have been and for the purpose of determining such period the phrase such period having already appeared at the end of the first part In the circumstances the deliberate use as I conceive by the <ORG> of the words any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application appears to me to indicate chat the provisions of the second part of the sub section lay down a rule of general application in the case of all suits appeals and applications for which a period of limitation is prescribed by the special or local law I am further of opinion that the second part of the sub section has not been made a separate sub section but has been connected to the first part of the existing sub section by the word and I venture to think that possibly the more appropriate word would have been but in order to make it clear that the provisions of the second part apply also to the suits appeals and applications to which the first part refers and so to remove the anomaly which would otherwise arise when applying Section which is itself made subject to the provisions of Sections to of the Act Prior to its amendment in by the Indian Limitation Amendment Act of that year Sub section of Section of the present Act provided that Nothing in this Act shall affect or alter any period of limitation specially prescribed for in a suit appeal or application by any special or local law now or hereinafter in force in British India The meaning of the words affect or alter in both sections was judicially considered in number of cases and the view at first generally taken was that the words affect or alter referred only to the period of limitation prescribed by the Act and not to the method of calculating that period and that in consequence the general provisions of the Act were applicable to suits appeals and applications under other Acts which prescribed special periods of limitation There developed later a divergence of opinion in the different <ORG> as to the meaning of the words affect or alter the other view being that the provisions relating to the computation of the period of limitation affected if they did not alter the period of limitation and therefore did not apply to special or local laws A further question which also gave rise to considerable difference of opinion was whether the provisions of the Limitation Act applied to local or special laws which were held considered in themselves to be complete codes It was in these circumstances that in Section was amended by the substitution therefor of the section now in force and it is I think clear that one of the purposes of the amendment was to put an end to the controversy which had developed over the interpretation of the words affect or alter and to enunciate a rule which should be of general application to all suits appeals and applications for which a period of limitation is prescribed by any special or local law Although in construing an Act the argument as to the result is entitled to no great weight yet in order to determine the intention of the framers we may consider the results of suggested constructions of the language employed by them in order that we may give effect to their intentions if we can do so without putting a forced interpretation on their language If the second part of the sub section refers only to suits appeals and applications to which the first part applies that is to those suits appeals and applications for which a period of limitation is prescribed which differs from that provided therefor in the first schedule the consequences will be highly inconvenient for in that case the sub section will make no provision for what is to occur when either the special or local law prescribes for a suit appeal or application a period which is the same as the period prescribed for such suit appeal or application in the first schedule or when the schedule omits as in the case before us to provide a period of limitation Moreover a very anomalous position arises if the special or local law prescribes as in the case of certain suits under the Uttar Pradesh Tenancy Act three periods of limitation one of which is the same as the period prescribed in the first schedule and the two others are different <NAME> and <NAME> appear to have assumed that the provi sions of Section applied only where a special or local law prescribed a rule of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by Schedule <NAME> expressly held that to be so for no question said the learned Judge can arise unless two different periods of limitation are prescribed and a choice has to be made between them Schedule Limitation Act prescribed no period of limitation for an appeal but the <ORG> held that Section was applicable on the ground that If Schedule Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act The <ORG> considered that if a contrary view was taken Section of the Act would have no application and the appeal although barred by limitation could not be dismissed and this result could not have been intended by the <ORG> What Section requires is that the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law for a suit appeal or application shall be different from the period prescribed therefor by Schedule Nor with respect dees it appear that the startling result which the <ORG> envisaged as a consequence of the rejection of the view Which it felt obliged to take would follow for if an appeal is barred by limitation when the memorandum of appeal is preferred the right of appeal itself no longer exists and the <ORG> would in my opinion be bound to dismiss it on that ground In my opinion the first part of Section only comes into operation when two different periods of limitation are prescribed by Schedule and the special or local law respectively but for the reasons I have endeavoured to state the provisions of the second part of the sub section are of general application for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed by a special or local law for any suit appeal or application I do not entertain any doubt that the rules made by the former <ORG> at Allahabad under its Letters Patent and continued in force by the virtue of Clause <ORG> Amalgamation Order are special or local laws within the meaning of the Limitation Act Whether they constitute a local law or special law or partake of the nature of both is not necessary to determine in the present case The provisions of the Limitation Act mentioned in Clause a of Section have however effect in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by the special or local law and in my judgment the use of the phrase expressly excludes negatives the exclusion of these provisions by implication This sub section so far as is relevant provides that In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree In view of the opinion I have formed on the first submission of learned counsel for the appellant it is unnecessary for me to consider the second argument which he has advanced and on that argument I express no opinion In my judgment the appellant is entitled to exclude the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree appealed from and I would answer the reference accordingly The question referred to this Bench is as to whether in computing the period of limitation fixed by the rules of this Court for preferring a Letters Patent Appeal the time requisite for obtaining copies of the judgment and the decree should be excluded I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of my Lord the Chief Justice and my brothers <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The arguments advanced by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant are that the rules framed by this Court under the Letters Patent are special or Local law within the meaning of Section Limitation Act and therefore the provisions of Section of the Act would apply for the purpose of determining the period of limitation Under the common law in England there is no limit of time provided for the enforcing of rights and it is the various statutes of limitation that prescribed the periods within which actions may be brought or within which certain rights may be enforced The legislature appears to nave been alive to the fact that the periods prescribed for action under any special or local law might be different from the periods prescribed under the Indian Limitation Act and to provide for such cases Section was introduced specifically laying down that in cases of such difference between the periods of limitation prescribed by any special or local law and that prescribed in the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act the provisions of the special or local law would prevail and that in such circumstance Section would be applicable and the periods prescribed under the special or local law would be deemed to be the period prescribed by the first schedule A period of limitation prescribed under a special or local law may be either the same as that prescribed in the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act or different from the period so prescribed or a period which the first schedule to the Indian Limitation Act has omitted to prescribe In the second case Section Limitation Act lays down that the period prescribed under the special or local law would be read as if it were prescribed in the first schedule of the Limitation Act for purposes of applying Section of the Act In the third class of cases where a special or local law prescribes a period which Schedule I of the Indian Limitation Act has omitted entirely to prescribe the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall be applicable by virtue of the second part of Section as observed by my Lord the Chief Justice I respectfully adopt the reasons given by him for the view that the provisions of the second part of the sub section laid down a rule ot general application jn the case of all suits appeals and applications for which a period of limitation is prescribed by the special or local law <NAME> in AIR Bom considered Section Limitation Act to be applicable even when a particular special law prescribes a period whcih is not provided for in the first schedule of the Limitation Act at all It may also be different in the sense that it departs from the period of limitation fixed for various appeals under the Limitation Act If the first schedule of the Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act The learned Chief Justice felt that the language used by the <ORG> was not happy but he considered that the construction placed by him was necessary to reconcile the various difficulties caused by the other sections of the Limitation Act To avoid this startling result the learned Chief Justice felt constrained to put the construction that Section would be applicable when a period of limitation is prescribed under a special law while the first schedule of the Limitation Act has omitted to prescribe any such period It is necessarily a right to prefer the appeal within the period prescribed by that law and if the litigant fails to avail of that right within the time prescribed he cannot claim to possess or to exercise such right after the period has run out When the period ends his right expires and if he prefers an appeal after the period has ended and his right to prefer an appeal has expired the appeal would be rejected in limine as incompetent Apart from the question of applicability of Section Limitation Act to matters arising under special or local law Section also provides that for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for in suits appeals or applications by any special or local law the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Limitation Act shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by any such special or local law and the other provisions of the Act shall not apply This further provision in Section as to how the period of limitation prescribed by any special or local law is to be determined is independent of the earlier part of Section which deals with the applicability of Section Limitation Act only As mentioned before all possible remedies were thought of and provided for in the Articles and this provision further provides that if any special or local law lays down some period of limitation which may or may not have been prescribed in the first schedule of the Act the general rules which govern the determination of the period of limitation and are applicable to the periods prescribed in the first schedule have been made to govern those periods also which are so prescribed under the special or local law If they constitute special or local law the provisions of Section would make Section of the Act applicable <NAME> in <NAME> Mrs <NAME> AIR Rang FB in a <ORG> case however held that the rules made by <ORG> under its Letters Patent and by virtue of the Civil Procedure Code do not amount to a special or local law Section lays down that where the period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application expires on a day when the <ORG> is closed the suit appeal or application may be instituted preferred or made on the day that the court reopens When a period is prescribed for instituting a suit or preferring an appeal the suitor concerned is required to file a suit or appeal within that period If the <ORG> itself is closed and the suitor concerned is unable to file the suit or appeal within the specified period he cannot justly be said to be at fault and this section only provides that he will have an opportunity of filing the suit or appeal on the date that the <ORG> reopens after the expiry of the period during which he had to act There can be no doubt that all courts and authorities called upon to adjudicate on the question of limitation should take this reasonable rule into consideration when adjudicating a suit or appeal or application to be barred by time With great respect for the other view I feel that the rules of limitation contained in this Act cannot be construed as meaning cnly the schedules which form part of the Act This also is a rule of general application and cannot be said to be applicable only to the periods of limitation prescribed in the schedule It may be noticed that Section by its very provisions is applicable only to those cases where this section is made applicable by or under any enactment for the time being in force The rules which should be applied in computing the period of limitation have been set out in part of the Act and nowhere has it been stated in the sections contained in this part that the rules of computation should be applied only to the periods of limitation prescribed in the schedules These rules are general in nature and having regard to the fact thai the Limitation Ace is a Code dealing with the law of Limitation it does not appear correct to hold that these general rules are intended to be made applicable only to the periods prescribed in the schedule and not to the periods prescribed under other enactments A different view has however been taken by <NAME> in the <NAME> case A referred to above The first is in the words of the learned Chief Justice If the intention of the <ORG> was to refer to the period of limitation prescribed by other laws the <ORG> would have expressly so mentioned and the other reason is that when we turn to Section it also speaks of limitation prescribed and not limitation prescribed by the schedule and yet under Section the <ORG> had expressly to make Section applicable when the period of limitation was prescribed by a special or local law It appears to me that where in the same statute in Section the <ORG> has used the expression the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the first schedule and in Section and Sections and other sections the words are the period of limitation prescribed a difference in the meaning was intended and it would be right to say that there is some distinction between the two phrases It is possible that haying regard to the context in which the expression the period of limitation prescribed is used in a statute it might mean the period of limitation prescribed in that statute itself as laid down by the learned Chief Justice but we cannot ignore the fact that the Indian Limitation Act purports to be a Code relating to the law of limitation and prescription and besides prescribing the periods for various suits appeals etc Though there are provisions of a substantive nature the Limitation Act mainly forms part of adjective law A close examination of the second half of Section would however reveal that a situation was contemplated where the provisions contained in Section and Sections to and Section may be expressly excluded by any special or local law The object for which the Act was framed the scheme which is apparent from the provisions made in the various sections and the arrangement do not appear to support this construction Yet the <ORG> must have been alive and Sections and do indicate that it was so alive that periods of limitation not provided for in the schedules may be prescribed by other enactments and that periods of limitation different from those prescribed in the schedules might be prescribed by certain other enactments The two expressions have different meanings with great respect for the view taken I am unable to agree that in its anxiety to avoid repetition the <ORG> ignored the obvious difference in the meanings of the two expressions The question which has been referred to this Bench is whether the time required for obtaining copies of the judgment and decree appealed from should be excluded in computing the period of limitation fixed by the rules of this <ORG> for preferring an appeal under the Letters Patent When delivering the judgment the learned Judge granted leave to the present appellant to file a further appeal to <ORG> Reference has to be made to the Letters Patent of <ORG> in Allahabad in order to interpret the jurisdiction conferred by Clause of the Amalgamation Order and in this case the appeal to <ORG> lies from the judgment of a learned Single Judge in the two connected second appeals as to result of the continuance of the power to entertain such appeals which was granted by Clause of the Letters Patent The judgment of the learned Single Judge was delivered on and at the same time leave was granted to the appellant to file the special appeal The appellant however contended that under Section of the Indian Limitation Act be was entitled to exclude the period requisite for obtaining the copies of the judgment and decree The limitation for filing the special appeal was governed by Rule of Chapter III of the Rules of Court which was then as follows In all appeals under the Letters Patent a duly stamped memorandum of appeal shall be presented to the Registrar within days and not more from the date of the judgment unless a Judge in his discretion on good cause shown shall grant further time for its presentation The question that falls for consideration is whether in determining the period of days not more fixed by this rule for the presentation of the memorandum of appeal the period of limitation is to be determined after applying the provisions of Section of the Limitation Act or whether those provisions are inapplicable to such an appeal I have had the benefit of reading the judgments proposed to be delivered by my Lord the Chief Justice and my brothers <NAME> and <NAME> I may state at the outset that I entirely agree with my brother <NAME> that Section of the Indian Limitation Act cannot be held to apply to appeals under the Letters Patent for which limitation has been prescribed by the rules of <ORG> independently of Section of the Limitation Act <NAME> has already discussed in detail the reasons for his conclusion that independently of Section of the Limitation Act it is not justifiable to hold that Section of the Limitation Act would be applicable to appeals the limitation for which is prescribed by a special or local law and is not prescribed in the Limitation Act itself The question whether the general provisions of the Indian Limitation Act relating to the computation of the period of limitation are applicable in cases where the period of limitation is prescribed by a general law does not in my opinion fall to be considered in this case as the rules of <ORG> which prescribe the period of limitation for a special appeal cannot be held to be a general law I do not therefore consider it necessary express any opinion on the question whether Section of the Limitation Act and other sections of that Act which regulate the computation of the period of limitation are applicable to cases where the period of limitation to be computed has been prescribed by a general law which may be in pari materia with the Limitation Act such as the Code of Civil Procedure He went on to add It followed that if there was a general provision in the Limitation Act it would govern also provisions as to limitation contained in the Civil Procedure Code While reserving my opinion on this question I have however no hesitation in holding in agreement with my brother <NAME> that where the period of limitation is prescribed by a special or local law which is not in pari materia with the Limitation Act Section of the Indian Limitation Act or other sections laying down general principles for computation of the period of limitation prescribed are not applicable independently of Section of the Act It appears to me to be unnecessary to deal with this question in detail as I agree with the reasoning of my brother <NAME> and adopt it for the purpose of arriving at this conclusion I would however like to add a further argument in support of this view but before doing so I consider it necessary to examine the question whether the rules of <ORG> which prescribe the period of limitation for a special appeal are a special or local law or not The Letters Patent of <ORG> were issued on by Her Majesty Queen Victoria in exercise of the powers conferred by Section of an Act of Parliament designated as an Act for establishing <ORG> in India Vict which came into force on The power conferred under Section of making rules to regulate the manner for the exercise of the original and appellate jurisdiction by <ORG> was also conferred on other <ORG> constituted under Section of the Act by the latter section The Letters Patent of <ORG> issued in laid down in Clause the provision that an appeal shall lie to the said <ORG> from the judgment of one Judge of the said <ORG> or one Judge of <ORG> made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subordinate to the superintendence of the <ORG> where the Judge of the said <ORG> certifies that the case is a fit one for appeal The power of making rules to regulate the manner for the exercise of such jurisdiction granted by Section of the Act of Vict Patent including the power to make rules for regulating the practice of the <ORG> The same power to make rules was subsequently continued in the <ORG> by Section of the Government of India Act and by Article of the Constitution which clearly mentioned that the powers of the <ORG> include the power to make rules of <ORG> It is clear in these circumstances that the rules of <ORG> when first made by the High <ORG> in Allahabad were made in the exercise of the powers conferred on the High <ORG> to make such rules under Sections and of the Act of Vict These rules continued in force and were amended from time to time by <ORG> in exercise of the same powers or the powers which vested in <ORG> under Section of the Government of India Act Section of the Government of India Act and Article of the Constitution of India These rules have limited application They apply to the procedure in <ORG> which exercises jurisdiction in the State of Uttar Pradesh only In this connection I may take notice of the remarks of a Special Bench of <ORG> in AIR Pat which is the only case brought to our notice in which the question directly arose whether the provisions of Section of the Limitation Act were applicable to a Letters Patent Appeal under Cl of the Letters Patent of <ORG> <NAME> the third Judge constituting the Bench also did not express any definite opinion on the question whether the rules of <ORG> have the force of a special or local law The question that has to be considered is whether the rules of <ORG> which prescribe the period of limitation for presentation of such a memorandum of appeal are a special or local law Sub of Section Is as follows Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply It appears to me that the amendment of Section in the year was made by <ORG> principally on account of the different interpretations which had been put on that section as it stood prior to the amendment and on the corresponding provisions Jn the earlier Limitation Act and the difficulties that arose as a result of those interpretations The case law before the amendment of was not clear as to whether and under what circumstances Sections or other general provisions of the Limitation Act relating to the computation of the period of limitation prescribed were applicable to the determination of the period of limitation prescribed by any special or local law In view of this language it became necessary to interpret the scope of the words affect or alter and views differed whether the rules of computation contained in other sections of the Limitation Act did or did not affect or alter the period of Limitation prescribed by the special or local law This sub section itself is divisible into two parts The first part of this sub section is to the effect that Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule This part was designed to resolve the conflict which could occur if a special or local law prescribed for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act To obviate the necessity of relying on such a principle of interpretation of statutes the <ORG> thought it fit to resolve the conflict by specifically laying down the provision which is contained in the first part of Sub section of Section under which the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law was deemed to be substituted for the period prescribed by the first schedule to the Indian Limitation Act period prescribed for a suit appeal or application by the first schedule to the Limitation Act is different from that prescribed therefor by any special or local law and it does mot come into operation until two such periods of limitation are prescribed This conflict between the period prescribed by the special or local law and the period prescribed by the first schedule to the Limitation Act having been resolved the <ORG> considered it further necessary to lay down in clear terms the rules for applying the other general provisions of the Limitation Act when computing the period of limi tation prescribed by a special or local law It was for this reason that the second part of Sub section of Section was worded as follows For the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply This part ot Sub section of Section appears to me to lay down a complete rule for determining the question of applicability of the general provisions of the Limitation Act for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed toy any special or local law cases where the special or local law prescribes for a suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from a period prescribed therefor by the first schedule to the Indian Limitation Act purpose of using the word any before all these expressions can only be that the <ORG> wanted to indicate very clearly its intention that this part of Sub section of Section would be applicable for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed for a suit appeal or application by a special or local law whatever may be that period of limitation whatever may be the nature of the suit appeal or application and whatever may be the special or local law in question The use of the word any before all these expressions thus leads to the inference that this part of Sub section of Section was not intended to be limited in its scope to the few cases covered by the first part of Sub section of Section To limit the scope of this second part to the cases covered by the first part would amount to limiting the signi ficance of the word any repeated three times in this part So far as I am aware there is no rule of grammatical construction requiring an interpretation that if sentences complete by themselves are connected by the conjunction and the second sentence must be interpreted as being limited to and referring to the first sentence This unhappy drafting of the sub section by linking the two parts with the conjunction and will not however justify an interpretation which would take away all effect of the words used in the second part of this sub section If this second part is limited to the cases which are covered by the first part it would not apply for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law but only for the purpose of determining those periods of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law which happen to be different from the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the first schedule to the Limitation Act Such restriction on the meaning of the word any used before the expression period of limitation prescribed in this second part cannot be justified merely on the ground that this second part has been linked with the first part by the conjunction and On the language of Sub section of Section therefore it appears to me that the correct interpretation would be to hold that this second part of this sub section is applicable for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law irrespective of the fact whether the period of limitation happens to be different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule to the Indian Limitation Act or is identical Apart from this question of interpretation of the language it will also be justified in such a case to examine the intention of the <ORG> for the purpose of interpreting this provision of law There is no doubt that if the language conveys a plain meaning <ORG> are not justified in examining the intention of the <ORG> while interpreting a provision of law and must interpret it according to the plain meaning of the language used If it be held that the use of the con junction and in order to link the first and second parts of Sub section of Section creates an ambiguity and enables courts to place the interpretation that the applicability of the second part is restricted only to those cases which are covered by the first part and to ignore the effect of the word any used before the expression period of limitation prescribed in the second part <ORG> would be justified in finding out what the real intention of the <ORG> was by considering the effect of the two different interpretations in its actual application to particular cases that are likely to arise The interpretation which appears to me to be correct on the language of Sub section of Section is that the second part of that sub section will apply in all cases for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application under any special or local law and as a consequence whenever the period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law has to be determined the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply except in so far as and to the extent to which they may be expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of the Limitation Act would not apply The effect of the other interpretation by which the scope of the second part is limited to cases covered by the first part can be consider ed in two different aspects One aspect arises on the view that even apart from Section all the general provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to the determination of the period of limitation prescribed by any special or local law when the period so prescribed is not different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule The other aspect arises on the view that those general provisions of the Limitation Act do not apply at all if the period prescribed by the special or local law is not different from the period prescribed by the first schedule The corresponding period of limitation for suits for possession of immovable property in the Indian Limitation Act is prescribed by Articles or of the First Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act The period of limitation prescribed for a suit under Section of the Tenancy Act was different in different circumstances The period prescribed for a suit governed by Articles or of the First Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act was years The result is that some of the suits falling under Section of the Tenancy Act would be governed by the same period of limitation as was prescribed for the corresponding suit for possession of immovable property under Articles or of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act whereas under some other circumstances the period would be different According to the view taken by me about the interpretation to be placed on Sub section of Section in all suits under Section of the Tenancy Act for purposes of determining the period of limitation prescribed by the Fourth Schedule to the Tenancy Act the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section of the Limitation Act will apply inasmuch as they have not been expressly excluded by any provision of the Tenancy Act In other cases where the period of limitation prescribed for the suit under Section of the Tenancy Act is years and is therefore not different from the period prescribed for the corresponding suit under the Limitation Act two different positions would arise There may be a case in which a suit is instituted under Section of the Tenancy Act beyond the period of limitation prescribed therefor in the Fourth Schedule but within that period computed from the date of an acknowledgment of his liability to ejectment by the person occupying the land which acknowledgment was made before the expiry of the period of limitation computed from the date of the cause of action It appears to me that the <ORG> in enacting Section of the Limitation Act could not possibly have intended to bring about such a result and create such anomalies If the second part of Section is held to be independent of the first part and applicable to the determination of all periods of limitation prescribed by a special or local law for any application Section Sections to and Section of the Limitation Act would be applicable in all these three cases I therefore held that the second part of Sub section of Section Limitation Act should be read independently of the first part and must be held to be applicable for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law irrespective of the fact whether the determination is being made in respect of the period of limitation which is different or identical with the period of limitation prescribed for the same suit appeal or application by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act I agree that the use of the words no more in that rule is clearly intended to exclude the applicability of any provision of law or rule which extends the time prescribed for the presentation of the appeal beyond days but the question is whether Section Limitation Act is a provision which extends the period prescribed What Section when applied to Rule of the Rules of Court thus brings about is not the extension of the period of days but even after applying this provision the period of limitation that has to be computed is the period of days and no more with the difference that the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the judgment is not taken into account and is exclu ded Sections and which deal with exclusion of time only cannot be held to be provisions extending the period of limitation prescribed Sub section of Section Limitation Act lays down In computing the period of limita tion prescribed for any suit appeal or application the day from which such period is to be reckon ed shall tye excluded If Section which lays down the exclusion of the date from which the period is to be reckoned is held to be a provision for extending time and thus excluded from application to the determination of the period of limitation under Rule of the Rules of <ORG> the question would arise whether the day on which the judgment by the learned Single Judge was pronounced is to foe taken into account in computing the period of days or not and this question would have to be decided by the <ORG> without any guidance under any other provision or law These words were used only for the purpose of excluding the application of such provisions of law as extend the time of limitation prescribed and not of other provisions which merely require exclusion of certain periods in computing the period of limitation prescribed The provisions relating to the computation of the period of limi tation were therefore made applicable by Section Limitation Act for the purpose of determin ing the period of limitation prescribed The dif ference between the word determining used in Section and the word computing used in Sections and does not in my opinion bring about any conflict as the language of Section is clear that in determining the period of limitation prescribed the provisions of the Limitation Act relating to computation of the period of limitation contained in Sections to must apply It does not appear to be necessary for me to deal at any length with the effect of the provision in Rule of the Rules of Court that the memorandum of appeal need not be accompanied by a copy of the judgment or decree appealed from The question to be decided is whether in a Letters Patent appeal the time requisite for obtaining copies of the judgment The relevant rule is Rule Chapter III Rules of Court in force in An application for leave to appeal under Section of the Letters Patent against an appellate judgment of a single Judge of this Court shall be made in writing or orally to the Judge deciding the appeal immediately after the judgment is delivered The appeal subject to the payment of proper court fees and presentation within time shall be entered in the list of appeals to be heard by a Bench of two Judges after notice issued to the opposite party under the orders of the Registrar The discretion given to the Judge is not with respect to condoning the delay in the presentation of the appeal but is with respect to granting further time which means that limitation for filing the appeal has come to an end on the expiry of days and unless that period is extended by a grant of further time the appeal could not be presented and consequently could not be entertained by the Court It was held by <ORG> of four Judges in All A that the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the judgment appealed from could pot be deducted in computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal under Clause of the Letters Patent It is now contended that this case is no longer good law in view of the case reported in AIR PC I and of the present Section Limitation Act of At the time when this appeal was filed and decided by the <ORG> the Limitation Act of was in force Paragraph of Section of that Act is In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal an application for leave to appeal as a pauper and an application for review of judgment the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree sentence or order appealed against or sought to be reviewed shall be excluded Section of the Act of is When by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India a period of limitation is specially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed In AIR PC I <ORG> had to consider the question whether the provisions of Section Sub section Limitation Act applied to the case of such appeals for which the period of limitation was prescribed in the Limitation Act and for whose presentation the memorandum of appeal need not be accompanied by a copy of the decree or judgment appealed from In considering the question their Lordships referred to the Indian cases having a bearing on the point If it had been otherwise I would have expected that the Allahabad case would not have been completely ignored from the discussion and if it had laid down wrong law even though without considering the question of the applicability of the provisions of Section Limitation Act their Lordships would have pointed it out In fact their Lordships themselves used the significant expression a rule fixed the period for appeal and there was no provision like that in the Limitation Act for excluding the period of time required for getting copies of the judgment and decree It can also be inferred from this decision of <ORG> that even if their Lordships had thought that the provisions of Section Limitation Act of had applied to other special or local laws on account of the expression prescribed being not restricted to the period of limitation prescribed in the Schedule of the Act they must have considered that its application to the rule for the presentation of the Letters Patent appeal would be barred in view of Section of the Act as that would have affected the period of limitation prescribed by the special law I shall deal later with the effect of Section Limitation Act on the question under determination and would first discuss the contended general applicability of the provisions of Section Limitation Act to periods of limitation prescribed by any law The contention for the appellant is that the provisions with respect to computation of period of limitation in Part III of the Limitation Act of would apply to the computation of the period of limitation prescribed by any law unless there be any specific provision that they would not apply and that therefore the provisions of Section of the Act apply to the rule of the <ORG> prescribing limitation for the presentation of a Letters Patent appeal the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree In support of his contention reliance is placed on the Full Bench decision reported in <NAME> <NAME> AIR All FB and the decisions of other High Courts which had subsequently agreed with that view I do not agree with tne views expressed in these cases regarding the applicability of the general provisions of the Limitation Act to periods of limitation prescribed by any other law I am not prepared to extend the application of other general provisions of the Limitation Act to periods of limitation prescribed by special or local laws or other rules of procedure having the force of law without examining the reasons for the view that Section Limitation Act controls Section I may refer to the observations of Lord <NAME> in Carmarthenshire County Council <NAME> AC at in this connection Now once a doctrine has become a rule of law it is the duty of the courts to apply and follow it without regard to its origin taut if to follow it would be to extend it in my opinion it is not only legitimate but essential to examine the origin and reason for it if it be known The Act of laid down the limitation of suits appeals and applications in Section which is Subject to the provisions contained in sections five to twenty five inclusive every suit instituted appeal presented and application made after the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the second schedule hereto annexed shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence Illustrations a A suit is instituted after the prescribed period of limitation Limitation is not set up as a defence and judgment is given for the plaintiff Sections and use the expression before the expiration of the period prescribed The other sections i Sections to in Part II and Sections and to in Part III do hot use any such expression which would make it necessary to inquire which period prescribed is referred to in the sections where such an expression is used In these illustrations the expression used is after the prescribed period without any reference to the period being prescribed by the second schedule annexed to the Act or without using any such expression which would have clearly pointed out that the prescribed period of limitation was meant to be the period of limitation prescribed by the second schedule of the Limitation Act Section did refer to the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the second schedule hereto annexed and therefore the illustrations to make the meaning of the main section clear must refer to the period of limitation prescribed by the second schedule hereto annexed and not to period of limitation prescribed by any law Section of this Act corresponds to Section of the earlier Act and is Subject to the provisions contained in Sections to inclusive every suit instituted appeal preferred and application made after the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the first schedule shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence Section deals with a case where the period of limitation prescribed expires on a day when the <ORG> is closed Section uses the expression after the period of limitation prescribed therefor Section Sub section is Where a person entitled to institute a suit or make an application for the execution of a decree is at the time from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned a minor or insane or an idiot he may institute the suit or make the application within the same period after the disability has ceased as would otherwise have been allowed from the time prescribed therefor in the third column of the first schedule The omission of the word so before the word prescribed in the expression in computing the period of limitation prescribed in Sections and of the Act and in other expressions using the mere word prescribed cannot therefore point to the inference that the period of limitation prescribed was meant to be the period of limitation prescribed by any law and not only that period of limitation which was prescribed by the first schedule of the Limitation Act The proviso to Section refers to the running of the time prescribed for a suit to recover the debt It was necessary here to qualify the word prescribed by using the expression by such rule referring to the foreign rule of limitation Sections and use the expression in computing the period of limitation prescribed and provide for the exclusion of certain periods It is in view of this effect that Sections and of the Act use the expressions at the determination of the period hereby limited and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed Section uses the expression before the expiration of the period prescribed for a suit or apolicatlon The expression before the expiration of the prescribed period is used in Section Its provisions therefore imply that the Act did contemplate that the period of exclusion provided under the various provisions for the computation of the period of limitation prescribed did really amount to enlarging the period of limitation prescribed for the institution of a suit Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply Nothing in this Act shall apply to suits under the Divorce Act Sections and and the definition of easement in Section shall not apply to cases arising in territories to which the Easements Act may for the time being extend Sub section a does contemplate that a special or local law may provide for the non application of all or any of the sections mentioned therein for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed by any special or local law This is reasonable because special or local laws deal with special subjects and special local conditions and there may be reasons for making the period of limitation prescribed more inelastic than they are in view of the general provisions of the Limitation Act If the general provisions of the Limitation Act for the computation of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application were applicable generally to all cases of limitation prescribed by any law and not only to such periods of limitation prescribed by the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act there was no necessity to express the second part of Section in such elaborate form I am therefore of opinion that the general expression in computing the period of limitation prescribed in Section Limitation Act and in other sections of the Act refers to the period of limitation prescribed by the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act and not to periods of limitation prescribed by any law Reliance was placed by the learned Judges on the observations in the <ORG> case reported in Ind App PC The question which arose for decision in that case was whether Sections and If at the time when the right to bring an action first accrues the person to whom the right accrues is under a legal disability the action may be brought by such person or his representative within the same time after the disability shall have ceased as would otherwise have been allowed from the time when the cause of action accrued unless such time shall exceed the period of three years in which case the suit shall be commenced within three years from the time when the disability ceased but if at the time when the cause of action accrues to any person he is not under a legal disability no time shall be allowed on account of any subsequent disability of such person or of the legal disability of any person claiming through him Section is When by any law now or hereafter to be in force a shorter period of limitation than that prescribed by this Act is specially prescribed for the institution of a particular suit such shorter limitation shall be applied notwithstanding this What their Lordships of <ORG> bserved at page on the first question which arose in that case is Upon the first they also agree with the learned Juage that Sections and of Act of do apply to the th section of the Act of The reason why Section of the Act was held to apply to Section Civil of was that the period of limitation prescribed under Section of Act of was not shorter than the period of limitation prescribed under Sub section of Section Limitation Act of for suits to alter or set aside summary decisions and orders of any of the civil Courts and therefore such period of limitation was not to be preferred to the period of limitation laid down in the Indian Limitation Act in view of the provisions of Section which was No suit shall be maintained in <ORG> within any part of the British territories in India in which this Act shall be in force unless the same is instituted within the period of limitation hereinafter made applicable to a suit of that nature any Law or Regulation to the contrary notwithstanding and the periods of limitation and the suits to which the same respectively shall be applicable shall be the following that is to say Further Section had no such expression which would have restricted the applicability of its provisions to those cases alone for which limitation was prescribed under the Limitation Act There is nothing prohibitory in the wording of the law itself I have already mentioned that Section does not use the words period of limitation prescribed The period of limitation may have been prescribed by any law I am therefore of opinion that it cannot be said merely on the basis of these observations of their Lordships of <ORG> that the expression in computing the period of limitation prescribed in Section Limitation Act of or in other sections of Chapter III of that ACT should refer to the computation of the period of limitation prescribed by any law <NAME> broke up the question In the case of <NAME> <NAME>O into two questions framing the first question in general form Does Section Civil prescribe a period of limitation At first he observed at page In view of the unqualified terms of Section of the Act and of the fact that periods of limitation are prescribed in a number of statutory enactments it does not appear that there is any justification judicial authority apart for restricting the operation of the section to the periods of limitation prescribed by the Act or by the First Schedule limitation prescribed by all laws It is true that certain general provisions of the Limitation Act had been made applicable in certain circumstances for determining the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law but their application can be excluded by an express provision in the special laws In fact as I have mentioned already if the general provisions of the Limitation Act were applicable to the periods of limitation prescribed by all Acts there was no necessity to enacfc the latter part of Sub section of Section The only question with which we are concerned in the present reference is as to whether these general provisions and in particular Section of the Act govern Section Civil This indicates that the scope of the first question formulated by him was narrowed down to the simple question whether Section Limitation Act governed Section Civil Limiting the question thus the learned Chief Justice observed Now the Code of Civil Procedure is not a special or local Act but there is high authority for the proposition that the provisions of the Code are subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act He then referred to the case of Ind App PC I have already referred to this case <NAME> went into the question In greater detail and laid emphasis on the facts that the expression prescribed therefor by the first schedule has not been used in the general provisions for computation of limitation and the word used there is simply prescribed and that if the word prescribed whenever used in the Limitation Act was meant to connote prescribed by the first schedule the <ORG> would have expressed this in the interpretation Section of the Act There are sections in the Act where the expression period of limitation is used and the word pre scribed is not used at all The latter part of Section does not use the expression in computing the period of limitation prescribed but uses the expression for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed and the change of language indicates that the <ORG> considered that the exclusion of certain periods in the computation of limitation really enlarged the period of limitation leading to a later date for determining the period of limitation for the institution of any suit appeal or application <NAME> observed at page In Section Limitation Act of there was nothing to limit the application of that section to suits with respect to which periods of limitation were provided for by the various clauses of Section of the Act and accordingly Section was of general application and applied even to suits not dealt with by the Act It would appear from the various sub sections of Section which lays down the period of limitation that the limitation was to run from certain dates or from the time when the cause of action accrued It follows that for applying the provisions of Section the Court will have to go to the other provisions of the same Limitation Act and I may again repeat that under the Limitation Act of limitation for suits was governed by the provisions of that Act and not by those of any other Act except in the case coming under Section Limitation Act of In the case reported in AIR Mad <NAME> who delivered the judgment observed at page after having referred to various decisions It is well established that the Limitation Act and the Code are to be read together because both are statutes relating to procedure and they are in pari materia and therefore to be taken and construed together as one system as explanatory of each other On the same page he observed later in para It followed that if there was a general provision in the Limitation Act it would govern also provisions as to limitation contained in the Civil Procedure Code Again he observed in para at page It appears to me from the course of legislation to which I have adverted above that the provisions of the Limitation Act must be read with those provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which are intimately connected therewith He observes in para at page On a careful consideration of the decided cases on the point and the course of legislation I have arrived at the following conclusions The expression prescribed in Section Limitation Act does not mean prescribed by the first schedule to the Act It was answered in favour of the appellant in view of the decision of <ORG> in AIR PC I It was also held in this case that the Letters Patent of the Court did not amount to special or local law The question before the Bench was whether the appellant was entitled under Section Limitation Act to deduct the time spent by him in obtaining a copy of the order of the <ORG> of first instance in proceedings under the Provincial Insolvency Act It may be mentioned at this stage that at the time of the decision of the <ORG> in Section Limitation Act for which the present Sub sections and were substituted in was differently worded and was Nothing in this Act shall a affect the Indian Contract Act Section affect or alter any period of limitation specially prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India The learned Judges first referred to the various cases having a bearing on the question and observed at There is therefore authority for the proposition that the general provisions of the Limitation Act are applicable to suits and other proceedings under other Acts which prescribe special periods of limitation but which are not intended to be complete Codes in themselves and that the words affect or alter in Section Limitation Act of relate only to the period prescribed and not to the way in which that period is to be computed It appears to me inconsistent and not based on any good reason that the general provisions of the Indian Limitation Act should be interpreted to apply to all periods of limitation prescribed by any law and then be not applied to periods of limitation provided by any law which is held to be a complete Code in itself Either they apply to the periods of limitation pre cribed by all laws or they apply to the periods pf limitation prescribed by the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act The basis for the view might have been that the special law contains such provisions which make the application of the general provisions of the Indian Limitation Act inconsistent with those provisions and therefore enacts Implledly that the general provisions of the Indian Limitation Act were not to apply to the periods of limitation prescribed by that Act Limitation Act to the periods of limitation prescribed by special or local laws The learned Judges further observed at The question is one of considerable difficulty and it must be admitted that at first sight It is straining the words to hold that the application of the general provisions of the Limitation Act to periods of limitation prescribed by other Acts does not affect or alter those periods It appears from the further observations in continuation of those quoted above that the learned Judges considered that the general provisions of the Limitation Act were founded mainly upon equitable considerations and found it difficult to believe that the <ORG> intended as a general rule that the special provisions giving a right of appeal and prescribing the periods within which the right may be exercised in other Acts should be applied without reference to the general provisions contained in the general Limitation Act It assumes that the period prescribed for a suit has expired The general effect of those cases is that the provisions of the Limitation Act are applicable to proceedings under special or local laws except so far as they affect or alter the periods prescribed by those special or local laws unless the special or local law is a complete Code by itself to which the general provisions of the Limitation Act cannot be applied without incongruity It is not disputed that the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act could have applied where possible to the proceedings under special Or local Acts Such conclusions do not emerge from these two <ORG> cases and there is substantial difference between Section Limitation Act of and Section Limitation Act of I have already referred to the case reported in Ind App PC and do not find anything to support the inference that a special Act is not controlled by the general provisions of the Indian Limitation Act only when it is of a very special kind complete in itself and when it does not admit of the several provisions of the Indian Limitation Act being imported into it without incongruity and without defeating the intention of the <ORG> I do not agree with the other reasoning and have already referred to the inference against it from the observations of their Lordships of <ORG> in Ind App PC the reasoning being that while Section Limitation Act of prohibited the application of the provisions of that Act to laws laying down periods of limitation different from those prescribed by the Limitation Act Section Limitation Act of merely barred the affecting or altering of the different periods of limitation prescribed by the special Act and did not bar the application of the general provisions relating to the computation of the period of limitation prescribed by the special Acts The relevant portion of Section Limitation Act of is When by any law not mentioned in the schedule hereto annexed and now or hereafter to be in force in any part of British India a period of limitation differing from that prescribed by this Act is specially prescribed for any suits appeals or applications nothing herein contained shall affect such law The law which laid down different periods of limitation and which had been considered in various cases did not lay down any particular rules for computation of the period of limitation This sub section is Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained In Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply The first part of Sub section relating to the applicability of the provisions of Section comes into play when any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule The provisions of Section of the Act will not apply if the period prescribed by the special or local law is not in conflict with the period prescribed for such suit appeal or application by the first schedule It may also be different in the sense that it departs from the period of limitation fixed for various appeals under the Limitation Act If the first schedule to the Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act If the period prescribed for such suit appeal or application by the special or local law be the same as provided by the first schedule of the Indian Limitation Act naturally the provisions of Section Limitation Act will apply as such ft proceeding would be covered by the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act and the party concerned should get the advantage of more beneficial provisions which happen to exist in the Indian Limitation Act The latter part of Sub section of Section does not use the expression in computing the period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law taut uses the expression for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law The other provisions of the Indian Limitation Act do not apply for determining such period of limitation <NAME> also observes at in the <ORG> case In our opinion the expression for the purpose of determining any period of limitation does not mean computing the period of limitation In our opinion every provision in the Limitation Act is Intended for the purpose of determining the period of limitation It is contended for the appellant that the latter part of Sub section would be applicable for determining the period of limitation by any special or local law in all cases and its application is not restricted to only those cases for which the period of limitation prescribed in the Indian Limitation Act differed from the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law It has also been contended that if the latter part had application to those cases only which were covered by the first part the word such would have been used for the word any before the expression suit appeal or application by any special or local law I am therefore of opinion that the latter part of Sub section of Section of the Act applies only to those cases which are covered by the first part of that sub section that is to cases where the special or local law provides a period of limitation for any suit appeal or application different from the period prescribed by the first schedule of the Limitation Act and not to all cases for which limitation was prescribed by the special or local law The above appeal was filed beyond days from the date of the delivery of judgment It would however be within time if the time re quired in obtaining the copies of the judgment were excluded as provided for in Section Limita tion Act The first Limitation Act was passed in the year Act of By Section of that Act shorter periods of limitation prescribed by any law other than that Act were saved The section provided When by any law now or hereafter to be in force a shorter period of limitation than that prescribed by this Act is specially prescribed for the institution of a particular suit such shorter period of limitation shall be applied notwithstanding this Act Section of this Act dealt with special periods of limitation prescribed by particular laws The section was in these terms When by any law not mentioned in the schedule hereto annexed and now or hereafter to be in force in any part of British India a period of limitation differing from that prescribed by this Act is especially prescribed for any suits appeals or applications nothing herein contained shall affect such law Section of this Act provided When by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India a period of limitation is specially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed This very same provision was contained in Section of the present Limitation Act of before it was amended in the year Thus in every Limitation Act from to an attempt was made to exclude the application of the provisions of the Limitation Act i to periods of limitation prescribed by special or local laws Before the year in numerous cases the <ORG> had to consider whether the general provisions contained in the Sections of the Limitation Act applied to periods prescribed by special or local laws Sections in which reference was made to the period of limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act either by using the expression prescribed in the first schedule or prescribed in the third column of the first schedule or prescribed hereby or contained in the Act obviously applied proprio vigore only to those periods of limitation which were prescribed by the Act and not to the periods prescribed by special or local laws unless they were made applicable by such laws But there was a difference of opinion as to the applicability of those general provisions of the Limitation Act in which reference was not directly made to the periods of limitation prescribed by the Act and in which either the word prescribed alone was used or even that word was not used In this class of cases the phrase affect or alter used in Section of the Act of or in Section of the present Limitation Act before its amendment in the year was held to forbid the application of the general principles laid down in the Limitation Act to periods of limitation prescribed by special or local laws on the ground that these general rules did affect or alter the periods prescribed by such laws On the other hand in other cases it was held that those sections of the Limitation Act in which reference was not directly made to the periods of limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act were general in their character and were applicable to all other laws which prescribed their own periods of limitation and that the application of those general provisions did not affect or alter the period of limitation prescribed by such laws because these provisions were merely intended to lay down the manner in which the periods of limitation were to be computed and did not affect or alter the periods themselves unless the special or local law was a complete code for the purposes of limitation This was the view held by this Court in All <NAME> <NAME> All All The same view was taken by the Madras Calcutta and Bombay Courts in some earlier decisions see Cal Bom and Mad The section after amendment stands as follows Where any special or local law prescribed for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply There are two parts of Sub section The first part makes the provisions of Section Limitation Act applicable to the period prescribed by a special or local law if that period be different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule The Limitation Act prescribes a period of limitation for all kinds of suits Article and applications Article but for appeals it prescribes a period of limitation for particular kinds of appeals only Hence the question becomes material whether the first part of Section applies to a special or local law which prescribes a period of limitation for an appeal when no such period is prescribed in the first schedule The question is whether in such a case it can be said that the special or local law prescribes a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule The reason given is that if the first schedule omits to lay down a period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act It runs as follows and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law This part applies to all special or local laws and not merely to those special or local laws which prescribe a period of limitation different from that prescribed in the first schedule If it was intended that the second part should apply to only those special or local laws which lay down a period different from that prescribed in the first schedule to the Limitation Act and not to laws which prescribe a period of limitation when no period of limitation is prescribed in the Limitation Act the word such would have been used in the place of any in the phrase any period of limitation or in the phrase any special or local law It follows therefore that the provisions of Section Sections to and Section apply to all periods of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law except when they are expressly excluded by such special or local law Section would apply to the period of limitation prescribed for instituting a special appeal unless the provisions are expressly excluded by such law The extension of the period of limitation under the rule can be made only on one ground namely on good cause shown and thus there is an express exclusion of any other mode of extension of period The general rules prescribed in the Limitation Act for determining and computing the period of limitation prescribed for a suit application or appeal to extend the period of limitation for various reasons under Section for an appeal or application for good cause shown under Section for suits and applications on the ground of legal disability under Section on the ground of time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree or judgment appealed from under Section on the ground of the absence of the defendant out of British India under Section on the ground of bona fide proceedings in another Court which had no jurisdiction under Section on the ground of stay of institution of a suit or execution of a decree by injunction or order under Section on the ground of proceedings for setting aside the sale under Section on the ground of fraud of the opposite party under Section on the ground of acknowledgement and so forth I have no doubt in my mind that the framers of the rule intended that the period of limitation of days shall not be altered or extended by any mode of computation or calculation except upon one condition namely when sufficient cause for the same was shown I think that the principle of this decision applies to the provisions of Rule of Chap It was urged that the provisions of Section Limitation Act do not enlarge the period of limitation fixed for filing appeals but only lay down a method of computation or calculation of the period of limitation How are the provisions of Section given effect to if not by adding to the period of days in the case of Letters Patent appeal for example the number of days spent in obtaining a certified copy of the judgment or decree If this is not addition to the period of days what else is it Section lays down that Where the period of limitation prescribes for any suit appeal or application expires on a day when the Court is closed the suit appeal or application may be instituted preferred or made on the day that the Court reopens Section lays down that in computing the period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application the day from which such period is to be reckoned shall be excluded In my opinion the case in All A which was decided when the rule prescribing the period of limitation for Letters Patent appeals was the same as mentioned in Rule of Chap III of the Rules of the Court in force in was correctly decided and this also seems to be the view of <ORG> as expressed in AIR PC I where their Lordships observed It appeared at one time during the course of the argument that an earlier decision of a Full Bench of <ORG> when Sir <NAME> was Chief Justice <NAME> <NAME> A was to the coa trary effect but after closer examination it was discovered by their Lordships that the case was not a decision on the Limitation Act but upon what is known as a Letters Patent appeal that is an appeal under the clause in the charter constituting the <ORG> a rule fixed the period of appeal and there was no provision like that in the Limitation Act for excluding the period of time required for getting copies of the judgment and decree I would therefore hold that the time required for obtaining copies of judgment and decree appealed from cannot be excluded in com puting the period of limitation fixed by the Rules of this Court for preferring an appeal under the Letters Patent unless the Court considers that the whole of such period or a part of it should be excluded on the ground that this constituted good cause for not preferring the appeal within days from the date of the judgment
