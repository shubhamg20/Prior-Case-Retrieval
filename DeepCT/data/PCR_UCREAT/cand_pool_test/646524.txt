Appeal from the judgment and order dated December of <ORG> in Criminal Appeal No of The Judgement of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The appellant who was the Assistant Controller of Imports in the office of the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports Madras was tried by the Special judge Madras on three charges one under section of the Indian Penal Code another under read with of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the third which was added later under of the Indian Penal Code On the next day the memorandum of appeal was sent by registered post to <NAME> the Joint Chief Controller Whoever being a public servant accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or to be likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having arty connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both Arumugam was concerned in an appeal against an order rejecting an application for export licence And when a question arises in any case whether a public servant A is a subordinate to public servant it presents little difficulty He contends that while the appellant was administratively subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports he was not functionally subordinate to that officer as Assistant Controller of Imports he had nothing to do with the matter of appeal against the rejection of the application for exports so he was not subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller within the meaning of the section The use of the words functionally subordinate does not appear to be very happy as in every case of administrative subordination there is also subordination in respect of some functions at least What the learned Counsel really means by his argument is that subordinate in the section means subordinate in respect of those very official functions with which the business or transaction has connection In support of his arguments he has drawn our attention to the provisions of a and of the Indian Penal Code and he points out that makes punishable the taking by a public servant of gratification in respect of his officials act or his official functions makes punishable the taking of gratification by any person for inducing by corrupt or illegal means a public servant to do or not to do some thing in connection with his official functions makes punishable the taking of gratification by any person for inducing by the exercise of personal influence a public servant to do or not to do something in connection with his officials function a office Peon of a department under the Collector which has nothing to do with revenue matters accepts money from A knowing that A has such business with will then be committing an offence under is It will perhaps not often happen that will have an opportunity of accepting money from A when he has not even a plausible chance of doing something for A in connection with the application But assuming that he has that opportunity and does accept the money as stated in the illustration above we cannot see what untoward consequences will ensue if conduct is made punishable under When with that intention the legislature has used the word subordinate in without any limitation there is no justification for reading into the word the limitation suggested by the learned Counsel by the words in respect of those very functions We find however that <ORG> granted the certificate only on the ground that the question raised by the Counsel as regards the interpretation of the word subordinate in the section was a substantial question of law which was not covered by any specific authority and was also a question of public importance In view of this we do not think it right to investigate the further question sought to be raised by Mr <NAME> in this case and we have not allowed him to argue that matter
