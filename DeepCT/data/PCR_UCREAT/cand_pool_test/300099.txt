This application by the first party is directed against a final order passed in a proceeding under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of acres equivalent to Bighas ka thas dhurs of land In my judgment there is no substance in this point Dr <NAME> has drawn my attention to section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that the District Magistrate or the Sub divisional Magistrate may depute any magistrate subordinate to him to make a local enquiry in a case under Chapter XII which includes Section and that the report of the Magistrate so deputed would be read as evidence in the case It seems to me however that this contention is misconceived The only difference is that the report of a Magistrate deputed under Section can be read in evidence without formal proof whereas the report of a pleader commissioner could not under the Code of Criminal Procedure as it stood before the amendments made by Act XXVI of be read in evidence without such proof The only provision under Section as it stood before the last amendment for consideration of materials was made in Sub section which laid down that the Magistrate should peruse the statements so put in hear the parties receive all such evidence as may be produced by them respectively consider the effect of such evidence take such further evidence if any as he thinks necessary and if possible decide whether any and which of the parties was at the date of the order before mentioned in such possession of the said subject There are two points which support this conclusion There is nothing in this sub section to show that the Magistrate can only peruse a document put in by a party if it is for mally proved nor is there anything in it to show that the document must be gut in evidence by getting it formally proved It seems to me to be manifest therefore that a document put in by a party in a case under Section need not be formally proved before it is considered by the Magistrate Although the affidavits of persons were filed on behalf of the first party the learned Magistrate has mentioned in his judgment that affidavits of only four persons were filed on their behalf Again although the affidavits of ten persons were filed on behalf of the second party the learned Magistrate has mentioned that those of persons were filed on their behalf In fact the learned Magistrate has considered the evidence of five witnesses on behalf of the first party though he has said that the affidavits of only four persons were filed on their behalf Had he done so he could not have made mistakes in mentioning the number of persons whose affidavits were filed on behalf of each party The learned Magistrate is entirely wrong however in thinking that it is not necessary even to consider the affidavits which now take the place of oral evidence given by witnesses The Magistrate should consider the affidavit of each deponent and should give his reasons for accepting or not accepting it The same rule should apply in the case of affidavits In my judgment the learned Magistrate judgment is vitiated for non consideration of all the affidavits filed on behalf of the parties He was obviously not even aware of the number of affidavits filed on behalf of each party
