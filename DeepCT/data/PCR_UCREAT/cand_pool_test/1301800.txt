on the th January th April th July and th October in every year the first payment to be made on the th January and that if any quarterly payment of interest were in arrear for more than one calendar month after becoming due he would pay compound interest on the amount of interest in arrear at the rate of per cent shall deem proper and also with power to buy in or rescind or vary any contract for sale and to resell without being responsible for any loss occasioned thereby and for the purposes aforesaid or any of them to execute and do all such assurances and things as they shall think fit shall not execute the power of sale hereinbefore contained unless and until default shall have been made in payment at the time hereinbefore appointed for payment thereof of some principal money or interest the payment whereof is intended to be hereby secured and they shall have given a notice in writing to the said <NAME> his heirs executors administrators or assigns to pay of the moneys for the time being owing on the security of these presents or left a notice in writing to that effect at or upon some part of the said premises etc and default shall have been made in payment of the whole or part of such moneys for one calendar month from the time of giving or leaving such notice or unless and until the whole or some part of some quarterly payment of interest which shall become due on the security of these presents shall have become in arrear for one calendar month and every such notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient though not addressed to any person or persons by name or designation and notwithstanding the person or any of the persons affected thereby may be unborn unascertained or under disability His defaults in payment of interest and instalments subsequently continuing notice was sent by the <ORG> to him by post on the th of October of their intention to sell the mortgaged premises if he did not pay the amount due upon the mortgage He has denied receipt of that notice but the evidence perfectly satisfies us as it also did the Subordinate Judge that the notice reached <NAME> in due course of post The sale took place on the th of December by public auction in Bombay conducted by respectable auctioneers Messrs which he paid to the <ORG> and the property was conveyed to him by that Land Mortgage <ORG> by a regular conveyance in the English form dated the th January This however he failed to establish and the offer made in that Court by the purchaser <NAME> to let the mortgagor have the property back again if he would repay to the purchaser the amount of his purchase money Rs He brought the present suit in the same year to eject the mortgagor <NAME> from the lands and to recover from him mesne profits Rs pursuant to a notice which he had given to him some months previously that if he did not give up possession of the last mentioned premises the purchaser would hold him responsible for rent at the rate therein specified Several grounds of defence were put forward in <ORG> some of which were repeated in the memorandum of appeal but the only point which the learned pleader for the appellants the Honourable Mr <NAME> insisted upon in this <ORG> was that <ORG> had not power to sell the mortgaged property without the intervention of <ORG> The first observation to be made with regard to that case is that there are not in the Bombay regulations as in those of Bengal any provision regulating the foreclosure of mortgages expresses strong doubts as to the supposed impolicy if that be a legitimate argument of sanctioning a power of sale and lastly that it is mentioned in a recent case before <NAME> and <NAME> <ORG> They disposed of the case upon another ground namely that there had been no notice given to the purchaser under a power of sale in an English mortgage deed of of foreclosure proceedings by the holder of a deed of conditional sale of and held that a suit for possession by the widow of the latter was therefore unsustainable against the purchaser under the mortgage of And I may observe that there is not any inconsistency in maintaining the validity of a sale under such a power with the decision of our predecessors in this <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> Bom In the latter case if the clause of conditional sale be enforced the property howsoever it may exceed in value the amount of the advance on mortgage becomes wholly vested in the mortgagee which is unquestionably inequitable whereas a mortgagee with a power of sale not only cannot either directly or through the medium of an agent or a trustee himself become the purchaser under the power <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> Sales under such a power as we have here have always when not open to special objection been upheld in the Island of Bombay and unless we find the law to be otherwise in the Bombay mofussil we see no sufficient reason for imposing upon parties contracting with respect to land situated there a disability which does not exist in the Island
