HEADNOTE Held that Article A and Note I thereto of the Civil Service Regulations relating to the retiring pensions of officers was applicable to the appellant who was employed in as a member of <ORG> because Rule of the new Rules published by <ORG> on th November providing for compulsory retirement of any officer after the completion of years service was validated and confirmed by section of <ORG> Act which came into force on rd December and the language of Note to Article A published in clearly indicates that the <ORG> right to compulsorily retire an officer was not derived from Note as Note assumed its existence aliunde and the <ORG> right was derived from new Rule published on th November But there is no such element of charge or imputation in the case of compulsory retirement The Officer dismissed or removed does not got pension which he has earned The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal arises out of an application made by the appellant to <ORG> under article of the Constitution praying for an appropriate writ quashing the order made by the President of India on the th April ordering the compulsory retirement of the appellant who had completed years qualifying service <ORG> by its judgment dated the st October dismissed the application but as the case involved a substantial question of the interpretation of the Constitution <ORG> granted leave to the appellant to appeal to this Court A copy of that letter is annexed to the Petition filed under article On the th January <ORG> of the Government addressed a letter to the Chief Engineer <ORG> requesting him to communicate the letter enclosed therewith to the appellant and to ask him to submit as early as possible whatever explanation he might desire to give The enclosed letter called upon the appellant to show cause within three weeks why he should not be compulsorily retired under the provisions of article A Civil Service Regulations as it appeared that he had been making systematic and gross overpayments apparently for no other reason than to benefit the contractors concerned and that he had spent large amounts of public money for his own personal convenience and that he had taken recourse to devious and unscrupulous methods Control and Appeal Rules but before taking the action indicated above <ORG> were pleased to and an opportunity to <NAME> I to show cause why he should not be compulsorily retired A copy of the letter of the th January together with a copy of the enclosure was sent to the appellant with the request that his explanation might be forwarded The appellant submitted his explanations which together with the Chief Engineer comments thereon were placed before <ORG> The <ORG> came to the conclusion that five out of the six charges had been proved and submitted their report accordingly Before this order could be served on him the appellant on the th April filed before <ORG> a petition under article of the Constitution praying that the order made by the President on the th April be quashed on the ground inter alia that the order was illegal and void in that it was made without affording him any opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him The present appeal is directed against that order of dismissal There are two notes appended to the article of which the first one is important for our present purpose For officers mentioned in article A the rule for the grant of retiring pension is as follows A retiring pension is also granted to an officer who is required by Government to retire after completing twenty five years qualifying service or more The contentions urged before us are that the President Order of the th April is invalid and inoperative for the following reasons that article A of the Civil Service Regulations is not applicable to or binding on the appellant ii that compulsory retirement is nothing but removal from service and the provisions of article of the Constitution apply to the case of compulsory retirement iii that Note I to article A of the Civil Service Regulations in so far as it confers on the Government an absolute right to retire an officer who has completed twenty five years qualifying service without giving any reason is repugnant to article of the Constitution Sub section of section of that Act provided for removal of doubts that all rules in operation at the time of the passing of that Act whether made by the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> or by any other authority relating to <ORG> in India were duly made in accordance with the powers in that behalf and it confirmed the same But it is urged that as there is nothing to show that article A of the Civil Service Regulations was in operation at the time of the passing of the Government of India Act and that as all that has been shown is only that the article in question was amended and brought Reference is then made to sub section of that section which empowered the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to make rules for regula ting the classification of the Civil Services in India the methods of their recruitment their conditions of service pay and allowances and discipline and conduct and by such rules to delegate the power of making rules to the Governor General in <ORG> or to local Governments or to authorise <ORG> or local <ORG> to make laws regulating the public services It is pointed out that sub section did not empower the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to delegate the power to make rules concerning pensions to any authority in India Our attention is next drawn to sub section of section which specially safeguarded the interests of the civil servants employed by the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> by providing that their right to pensions and the scale and conditions of pensions should be regulated in accordance with the rules in force at the time of the passing of that Act and that although such rules might be varied or added to by the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> such variations or additions should not adversely affect the pension of any member of the service appointed before the date thereof It is urged that not only has article A not been shown to have been in force at the time of the passing of the Government of India Act it has also not been shown to have been made by the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> The above line of reasoning found favour with <ORG> but nevertheless <ORG> repelled the conclusions sought to be established by it on the ground that rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules read with rule of those Rules impressed the stamp of validity upon article A of the Civil Service Regulations and made it applicable to <ORG> While agreeing with learned counsel that there is some force in his contention that the construction put upon rule may not be quite cogent or convincing we do not consider it necessary to express any final opinion on that matter for in our judgment the major premise assumed by <ORG> that Note to article A has no application to the appellant cannot be supported or sustained The new rules were by rule made to apply only to officers joining the above services after the th August And to those existing officers who elected in writing to come under their provisions The material I part of rule of these new rules was as follows Government will have an absolute right to retire any officer after he has completed twenty five years service without necessity to give reasons and without any claim for compensation in addition to pension and in that event These rules which came into force on their publication in the Official Gazette of the th November were therefore in operation on the rd December when the Government of India Act was passed and were accordingly validated and confirmed by sub section of section of that Act to which reference has already been made Note I Government retains an absolute right to retire any officer after he has completed twenty five years service without giving any reasons and no claim to special compensation on this account will be entertained It will be noticed that clause and Note I quoted above are word for word the same as clause and Note of article A as we find it now except that the last sentence in Note in the present rule was not in article A Note I when it was published in It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that article A and Note I thereto came into force only in June that is to say after the Government of India Act had been passed and therefore cannot be said to have been confirmed by section and being a pension rule made after the date of that Act but not being a rule made by the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> it cannot under section apply to the appellant who was employed by the Secretary of <ORG> We therefore agree with the <ORG> though on different grounds that the first question raised by the appellant must be answered against him Learned counsel for the appellant urges that even assuming that rule announced by Resolution No A and on which Note I to article A of the Civil Service Regulations was based had on the passing of the Government of India Act become binding on the appellants it nevertheless became void on the coming into operation of the Constitution of India by reason of its being repugnant to the provisions of article of the Constitution The argument is that a compulsory retirement of an officer was nothing but his removal from service within the meaning of article and as rule as well as Note I to article A of the Civil Service Regulations sanctioned compulsory retirement without assigning any reason which in substance meant without giving him any opportunity to show cause against such action being taken in regard to him it became repugnant to article of the Constitution and therefore became void In England the rule was well established from very early times that public offices were held at the pleasure of the <ORG> Subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder every person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed and the Secretary of <ORG> in Council may except so far as he may provide by rules to the contrary reinstate any person in that service who has been dismissed As already stated sub section of this section validated and confirmed the then existing rules and sub section gave power to the Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council to make rules for regulating the classification of the civil services in India the methods of their recruitment their conditions of service pay and allowances and discipline and conduct The following penalties may for good and sufficient reason and as hereinafter provided be imposed upon members of the services comprised in any of the classes to specified in rule namely i Censure ii Withholding of increments or promotion including stoppage at an efficiency bar iv Recovery from pay of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to Government by negligence or breach of orders vi Removal from the civil service of the <ORG> which does not disqualify from future employment vii Dismissal from the civil service of the <ORG> which ordinarily disqualifies from future employment The termination of employment a of a person appointed on probation during or at the end of the period of probation in accordance with the terms of the appointment and the rules governing the probationary service or of a temporary Government servant appointed otherwise than under contract in accordance with rule of the Central Civil Services Temporary Service Rules or of a person engaged under a contract in accordance with the terms his contract does not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule or of rule Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act no order of dismissal removal or reduction shall be passed on a member of a service other than an order based on facts which had led to his conviction in a criminal <ORG> or by a <ORG> martial unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself The rest of this rule which lays down the details of procedure to be followed need not be quoted for our present purpose Under article of the Civil Service Regulations no pension may be granted to an officer dismissed or removed for misconduct insolvency or inefficiency but to officers so dismissed or removed compassionate allowances may be granted when they are deserving of special consideration provided that such allowance shall not exceed two thirds of the pension which would have been admissible to him if he had retired on medical certificate As regards pension both dismissal and removal stand on the same footing namely that both of them entail loss of pension and even when a compassionate allowance is granted in either case such allowance is much less than the pension that had been earned Except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> in India or holds any civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed from the service of His Majesty by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed I A A opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him In short sub section reiterated the English constitutional theory sub section reproduced the restriction introduced by section of the Act and sub section gave statutory protection to the rights conferred by rule of the Civil Service Classification Control and Appeal Rules but which prior to this Act of had been held by <ORG> in the two last cited cases to be ineffective against the <ORG> plenary power of dismissal It will however be noticed that in sub section the word removed was not used although that word occurred in rule and the other rules quoted above It was however held in <NAME> case that removal was within section which conclusion implies that removal is comprised within dismissals The position therefore is that both under the rules and according to the last mentioned decision of <ORG> there is no distinction between a dismissal and a removal except that the former disqualifies from future employment while the latter does not No such person aforesaid shall be dismissed removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him in <NAME> <ORG> it has been said that these terms have been used in the same sense in article a termination of service but every termination of service does not amount to dismissal or removal There is no such element of charge or imputation in the case of compulsory retirement this power of compulsory retirement may be used when the authority exercising this power cannot substantiate the misconduct which may be the real cause for taking the action but what is important to note is that the directions in the last sentence in Note to article A make it abundantly clear that an imputation or charge is not in terms made a condition for the exercise of the power in the present case there was no doubt some imputation against the appellant which he was called upon to explain but it was made perfectly clear by the letter of the th January that the Government was not holding any formal enquiry under rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules and that before taking action for his compulsory retirement the Government desired to give him an opportunity to show cause why that action should not be taken the officer dismissed or removed does not get pension which he has earned There is no diminution of the accrued benefit It is said that compulsory retirement like dismissal or removal deprives the officer of the chance of serving and getting his pay till he attains the age of superan nuation and thereafter to get an enhanced pension and that is certainly a punishment It is true that in that wide sense the officer may consider himself punished but there is a clear distinction between the loss of benefit already earned and the loss of prospect of earning something more to the conclusion that a compulsory retirement does not amount to dismissal or removal and therefore does not attract the provisions of article of the Constitution or of rule and that therefore the order of the President cannot be challenged on the ground that the appellant had not been afforded full opportunity of showing cause against the action sought to be taken in regard to him Both the questions under consideration must also be answered against the appellant In the circumstances of this case we make no order as to costs
