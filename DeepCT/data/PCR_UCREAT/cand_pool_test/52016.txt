Section makes provision of an appeal to <ORG> against the order of <ORG> The respondent landlord filed an eviction petition against the appellant husband tenant on the ground of bona fide personal need The Rent Controller passed an order dismissing the petition The order was confirmed in appeal filed by the respondent before <ORG> Thereafter the respondent preferred a revision petition before the District Judge In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant tenant that <ORG> had exceeded its jurisdiction in setting aside the judgments and orders of the courts below since no revision lies to <ORG> against the order of the District Judge in view of read with of the Act which has completely ousted <ORG> jurisdiction to interfere ii Sub of of the Act says that subject to the decision of the appellate authority the decision of the Rent Controller shall be final an could only be ques tioned in the manner provided in section and in no other manner iii When section of the Act specifically states that shall not be liable to be called in question in any Court of law except in the manner provided under section it cannot be said that <ORG> which is a court of law and which is a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure under section of the Code of Civil Procedure could revise again an order on again after revision under section of the Act The language of the provisions of section read with section inhibits further revision The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave from the decision of learned single judge of <ORG> is disposed of on a short question of law It is the case of the appellant that there were seven rooms on the first floor of the said building out of which four were in the possession of the respondent and three rented out as aforesaid On th April the respondent filed an application under section of the Kerala Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act hereinafter called the Act for permission to convert the non residential building to a residential build ing On nd June the respondent filed the petition for eviction of the appellant on the ground of bona fide need of the premises in question for his residence She was therefore impleaded as the legal representative and she is conducting the business since the death of her husband By the order dated th August <ORG> by its impugned order has set aside all the orders of the courts below <NAME> Several questions were posed before us in this case inter alia i whether the revision under section of the Code of Civil Procedure lies to <ORG> from a revision order passed under section of the said Act ii whether <ORG> has exceeded its jurisdiction under section in setting aside the judgments and orders of the courts below in ordering eviction of the appellant from the premises in question reversing the findings of facts iii whether eviction of a tenant from a non residential building could be ordered for the user of the building for residence of the landlord if the Accommodation Controller had refused permission under section of the Act to convert the build ing from non residential to residential iv where the Accommodation Controller refused the permission to convert the building from non residential to residential does the claim to the building by the landlord for a residential purpose become illegal and not recognised by law and whether the claim of the landlord can still be held to be bona fide whether in ordering eviction the special reasons relied on by <ORG> on a reappreciation of facts are borne out from the evidence in this case and whether the facts stated by <ORG> constitute special reasons re quired under the first proviso to section in ordering eviction and setting aside the judgments and orders of the courts below A landlord may apply to <ORG> for an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building if he bona fide needs the build ing for his own occupation or for the occupa tion by any member of his family dependent on him Provided that <ORG> shall not give any such direction if the landlord has another building of his own in his possession in the same city town or village except where <ORG> is satisfied that for special reasons in any particular case it will be just and proper to do so Provided further that <ORG> shall not give any direction to a tenant to put the landlord in possession if such tenant is depending for his livelihood mainly on the income derived from any trade or business carried on in such building and there is no other suitable building available in the locality for such person to carry on such trade or business Provided further that no landlord whose right to recover possession arises under an instrument of transfer inter vivos shall be entitled to apply to be put in possession until the expiry of one year from the date of the instrument Provided further that if a landlord after obtaining an order to be put in posses sion transfers his rights in respect of the building to another person the transferee shall not be entitled to be put in possession unless he proves that he bona fide needs the building for his own occupation or for the occupation by any member of his family depend ent on him In the view we have taken on the question that no revi sion lay to <ORG> it is not necessary to refer to other provisions of the Act or to the details of the facts of this case Any person aggrieved by an order passed by <ORG> may within thirty days from the date of such order prefer an appeal in writing to the appellate authority having jurisdiction In computing the thirty days aforesaid the time taken to obtain a certified copy of the order appealed against shall be excluded The appellate authority shall have all the powers of <ORG> including the fixing of arrears of rent Revision In cases where the appellate authority empowered under sec tion is a Subordinate Judge <ORG> and in other cases <ORG> may at any time on the application of any ag grieved party call for and examine the re cords relating to any order passed or proceed ings taken under this Act by such authority for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality regularity or propriety of such order or proceedings and may pass such order in reference thereto as it thinks fit It has further to be borne in mind that the Act in question was an Act to regulate the leasing of buildings and to control the rent of such buildings in the State of Kera la It was contended by <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant that no revision lay to <ORG> He sub mitted that section read with section of the Act has completely ousted <ORG> jurisdiction to interfere in this matter under section of the Code of Civil Procedure Under the scheme of the Act it appears that a landlord who wants eviction of his tenant has to move for eviction and the case has to be disposed of by <ORG> From <ORG> a revision in certain circumstances lies in case where the appellate authority is a Subordinate Judge to <ORG> and in other cases to <ORG> Lord <NAME> <NAME> construing the provisions of section of the Police Act of England which provided an appeal to quarter sessions as to the amount of a constable pension and also stipulated that the Court shall make an order which would be just and final observed Where it says speaking of such an order that it is to be final I think it means there is to be an end of the business at quarter sessions The said observation could most appropri ately be applied to the expression used by the legislature in sub section of section of the Act in question It means what it says that subject to the decision of the appellate authority the decision of the Rent Controller shall be final and could only be questioned in the manner provided in section and in no other manner observed at page of the report that the expression final prima facie meant that an order passed on appeal under the Act was conclusive and no further appeal lay Subject to the provisions of sub section an appeal shall lie to <ORG> from an order made by the <ORG> within sixty days from the date of such order No appeal shall lie under sub section unless the appeal involves some substantial question of law Save as otherwise ex pressly provided in this Act every order made by the Controller or an order passed on appeal under this Act shall be final and shall not be called in question in any original suit application or execution proceedings This Court observed at page that a combined reading of the said two sec tions made it clear that subject to the fight of appeal to <ORG> on a substantial question of law the order passed by the Controller or an order passed on appeal was final and could not be called in question in any original suit application or execution proceeding What is to be noted here is that there is nothing in the Section which says that the decision of the revisional authority under shall be final and shall not be called in question in any higher court The learned judge concluded that so long as there was no specific provision in the statute making the determi nation by <ORG> final and excluding the super visory power of <ORG> under section of the Code of Civil Procedure it had to be held that the decision rendered by <ORG> under section of the Act being a decision of a court subordinate to <ORG> to which an appeal lay to <ORG> was liable to be revised by <ORG> under section of the Code of Civil Procedure There was thereby an implied prohibi tion or exclusion of a second revision under section of the Code of Civil Procedure to <ORG> when a revi sion has been provided under section of the Act in ques tion When section of the Act specifically states that shall not be liable to be called in question in any Court of law except in the manner provided under section it cannot be said that <ORG> which is a court of law and which is a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure under section of the Code of Civil Procedure could revise again an order once again after revision under sec tion of the Act The language of the provisions of section read with section inhibits further revision Here in the instant case the right of appeal has been given under the Act not to any ordinary court of the country under the Code of Civil Proce dure but to the courts enumerated under the Rent Act This Court observed that section of the Code of Civil Procedure conferred on <ORG> of a State power to remove any jurisdictional error committed by a subordinate court in cases where the error could not be corrected by resort to its appellate jurisdiction Section of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act was amended from time to time in its application to the State of The two questions that fell for consideration before this Court were i whether <ORG> possessed the revisional jurisdiction under section of the Code of Civil Procedure in respect of an order of <ORG> under section disposing of a revision petition and ii whether <ORG> possessed revisional jurisdiction under section of against an order of <ORG> under section of Provincial Small Cause Courts Act In that view of the matter we are of the opinion that the Full Bench of <ORG> was in error and <ORG> in the instant case had no jurisdiction to inter fere in this matter under section of It was urged that in case we are of the opinion that a revision under section of the Code of Civil Procedure does not lie the case should be remitted to <ORG> for consideration as a petition under article of the Constitution The two procedures are not interchangeable though there are some common features
