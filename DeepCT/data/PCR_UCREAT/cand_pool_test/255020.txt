on the ground that the said amount had been illegally recovered from it under the Madras General Sales Tax Act for the years On the merits it was contended that the transactions in regard to groundnuts on which sales tax was levied and recovered from the appellant were transactions of purchase and not of sale and it was urged that the appellant having voluntarily made the return and paid the taxes it was not open to it to contend that the transactions were not taxable under the Act The appellant came to this Court by special leave There is no express provision in the Act under which the suit can be said to have been filed and it falls under the prohibition contained in this section Where an order of assessment has been made by an appropriate authority under the provisions of the Act any challenge to its correctness and any attempt either to have it set aside or modified must be made before the appellate or revisional forum prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Act If an order made by a taxing authority under the relevant provisions of the Act in a case where the taxable character of a transaction is disputed is final and cannot be challenged in a civil court by a separate suit the position is just the same where the taxable character of the transactions is not even disputed by the dealer who accepts the order for the purposes of the Act and then institutes a suit to set aside or modify it It is the activity of the assessing officer acting as such officer which is intended to be projected and as soon as it is shown that exercising his jurisdiction and authority under this Act an assessing officer has made an order of assessment that clearly falls within the scope of A The fact that the order passed by the assessing authority may in fact be incorrect or wrong does not affect the position that in law the said order has been passed by an appropriate authority and the assessment made by it must be treated as made under this Act Whether or not an assessment has been made under this Act will not depend on the correctness or accuracy of the order passed by the assessing authority There is a general presumption that there must be a remedy in the ordinary civil courts to a citizen claiming that an amount has been recovered from him illegally and such a remedy could be held to be barred only on very clear and unmistakable indications to the contrary The mere fact that a special statute provides for certain remedies may not by itself necessarily exclude the jurisdiction of the civil courts to deal with a case brought before it in respect of some of the matters covered by the said statute There is no justification for the assumption that if a decision has been made by a taxing authority under the provisions of a taxing statute its validity can be challenged by a suit on the ground that it is incorrect on merits and as such it can be claimed that the provisions of the said statute have not been complied with If an appropriate authority has acted in violation of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure that may also tend to make the proceedings illegal and void and that infirmily may affect the validity of the order passed by the authority in question It is cases of this character where the defect or infirmity in the order goes to the root of the order and makes it in law invalid and void that these observations may perhaps be invoked in support of the plea that the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction notwithstanding a provision to the contrary contained in the relevant statute The judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR The short question which arises in this appeal is whether the suit instituted by the appellant <ORG> in the court of the Subordinate judge at Kurnool seeking to recover Rs IX of hereinafter called the Act for the years is competent or not and this question has to be determined in the light of the scope and effect of section A of the Act It was urged that the suit was incomepetent having regard to the provisions of A of the Act and on the merits it was alleged that the transactions in regard to groundnuts on which lestax was levied and recovered from the appellant were transactions of purchase and not of sale The first issue was whether the suit was barred by A of the Act the second was whether there had been excess collection of sales tax for the two years in question and if so how much And the third issue was whether the appellant was estopped from questioning the validity of the assessment According to the trial court the respondent had failed to prove its pleas against the apppellant claim and so it recorded findings in favour of the appellant in all the three issues <ORG> has upheld the contentions raised by the respondent it is against this decree that the appellant has come to this Court by special leave the effect of the provisions of A In dealing With the question wether civil courts jurisdiction to entertain suit is barred or not it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that there is a general presumption that there must be a remedy in the ordinary civil courts to a citizen claiming that an amount has been recovered from him illegally and that such a remedy can be held to be barred only on very clear and unmistakable indications to the contrary The mere fact that a special statute provides for certain remedies may not by itself necessarily exclude the jurisdiction of the civil courts to deal with a case brought before it in respect of some of the matters covered by the said statute It is therefore necessary to enquire whether Aexpressly or by necessary implication excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a suit like the present It is common ground that there is no express provision made in the Act under which the present suit can be said to have been filed and so it falls under the prohibition contained in this section There is therefore no difficulty in holding that this section excludes the jurisdiction of the civil courts in respect of the suits covered by it It is however urged by Mr <NAME> that if an order of assessment has been made illegally by the appropriate authority purporting to exercise its powers under the Act such an assessment cannot be said to be an assessment made under this Act In support of this argument he has referred us to the provisions of and where any act done or purporting to be done under this Act is referred to It would however be noticed that having regard to the subject matter of the provisions contained in ss and it was obviously necessary to refer not only to acts done but also to acts purporting to be done under this Act Section is intended to bar certain proceedings and is intended to afford an indemnity and that is the reason why the legislature had to adopt the usual formula by referring to acts done or porting to be done It is the activity of the assessing officer acting as such officer which is intended to be protected and as soon as it is shown that exercising his jurisdiction and authority under this Act an assessing officer has made an order of assessment that clearly falls within the scope of A The fact that the order passed by the assessing authority may in fact be incorrect or wrong does not affect the position that in law the said order has been passed by an appropriate authority and the assessment made by it must be treated as made under this Act Whether or not an assessment has been made under this Act will not depend on the correctness or the accuracy of the order passed by the assessing authority In determining the applicability of A the only question to consider is Is the assessment sought to be set aside or modified by the suit instituted an assessment made under this Act or not It would be extremely anomalous to hold that it is only an accurate and correct order of assessment which falls under A Therefore it seems to us that the orders of assessment challenged by the appellant in its suit fall under A In this connection it is necessary to emphasise that while providing for a bar to suits in ordinary civil courts in respect of matters covered by A the legislature has taken the precaution of safeguarding the citizens rights by providing for adequate alternative remedies Section of the Act provides for appeals to such authority as may be prescribed confers revisional jurisdiction on the authorities specified by it A allows an appeal to the appellate <ORG> provides for a provision by <ORG> under the cases specified in it provides for an appeal to <ORG> and I lays down that petitions applications and appeals to <ORG> should be heard by a Bench of not less than two judges It would thus be seen that and dealer who is aggrieved by an order of assessment passed in respect of his transactions can avail him self of the remedies provided in that behalf by these sections of the Act Thus considered there can be no doubt that where and order of assessment has been made by an appropriate authority the provisions of this Act any challenge to its correctness and any attempt either to have it set aside or modified must be made before the appellate or the revisional forum prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Act If the order made by the taxing authority under the relevant provisions of the Act in a case where the taxable character of the transaction is disputed is final and cannot be challenged in a civil court by a separate suit the position would be just the same where the taxable character of the transaction is not even disputed by the dealer who accepts the order for the purpose of the Act and then institutes a suit to set it aside or to modify it The question about the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil courts to entertain civil actions by virtue of specific provisions contained in special statutes has been judicially considered on several occasions We may in this connection refer to two decisions of <ORG> The relevant portion of the said section provides that every order passed in appeal under this section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by be final Lord <NAME> who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> however proceeded to add that I A it is also well settled that that even if jurisdiction is so excluded the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure It is necessary to add that these observations though made in somewhat wide terms do not justify the assumption that if a decision has been made by a taxing authority under the provisions of the relevant taxing statute its validity can be challenged by a suit on the ground that it is incorrect on the merits and as such it can be claimed that the provisions of the said statute have not been complied with Non compliance with the provisions of the statute to which reference is made by <ORG> must we think be non compliance with such fundamental provisions of the statute as would make the entire proceedings before the appropriate authority illegal and without jurisdiction Similarly if an appropriate authority has acted in violation of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure that may also tend to make the proceedings illegal and void and this infirmity may affect the validity of the order passed by the authority in question It is cases of this character where the defect or the infirmity in the order goes to the root of the order and makes it in law invalid and void that these observations may perhaps be invoked in support of the plea that the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction notwithstanding a provision to the contrary contained in the relevant statute In what cases such a plea would succeed it is unnecessary for us to decide in the present appeal because we have no doubt that the contention of the appellant that on the merits the decision of the assessing authority was wrong cannot be the subject matter of a suit because A clearly bars such a claim in the civil courts It would be noticed that the words used in this section are exactly similar to the words used in A with which we are concerned In determining the effect of <ORG> considered the scheme of the Act by particular reference to the machinery provided by the Act which enables an assessee effectively to raise in courts the question whether a particular provision of the Income tax Act bearing on the assessment made is or is not ultra vires The presence of such machinery observed the judgment though by no means conclusive marches with a construction of the section which denies an alternative jurisdiction to enquire into the same subject matter The use of the machinery provided by the Act not the result of that use is the test These two Privy <ORG> decisions support the conclusion that having regard to the scheme of the Act A must be deemed to exclude the jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain claims like the present
