The assessment of the assessee for the assessment year for which the relevant accounting year was the calendar year was thereafter completed in the normal course and in this assessment no amount was included by way of capital gains in respect of the transfer of the house since the house was sold by the assessee at the same price at which it was purchased and no capital gains accrued or arose to him as a result of the transfer On th April however the <ORG> officer issued a notice under section of the Act seeking to reopen the assessment of the assessee for the assessment year and requiring the assessee to submit a return of income within thirty days of the service of the notice without stating what was the income alleged to have escaped assessment The objections raised by the assessee were overruled and an order of reassessment was passed by the <ORG> officer including the sum of Rs The assessee thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the validity of the order of re assessment insofar as it brought a sum of Rs Sub section has no application in case of an honest and bonafide transaction where the consideration received by the assessee has been correctly declared or disclosed by him and there is no concealment or suppression of the consideration The burden of proving an understatement or concealment is on the <ORG> which may be discharged by it by establishing facts and circumstances from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the assessee has not correctly declared or disclosed the consideration received by him and there is understatement or concealment of the consideration in respect of the transfer Sub section in the instant case had no application and the <ORG> officer could have no reason to believe that any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment so as to justify the issue of a notice under section The order of re assessment made by the <ORG> officer pursuant to the notice issued under section was accordingly without jurisdiction It is an attempt to discover the intent of the legislature from the language used by it and it must always be remembered that language is at best an imperfect instrument for the expression of human thoughts and it would be idle to expect every statutory provision to be drafted with divine prescience and perfect clarity <ORG>s therefore must eschew literalness in the interpretation of a statutory provision and construe the language having regard to the object and purpose which the legislature had in view in enacting that provision and in the context and the setting in which it occurs The speeches made by the Members of the <ORG> on the floor of the <ORG> when a Bill for enacting a statutory provision is being debated are inadmissible for the purpose of interpreting the statutory provision but the speech made by the Mover of the Bill explaining the reason for the introduction of the Bill can certainly be referred to for The purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the legislation and the object and purpose for which the legislation is enacted Again it is undoubtedly true that the marginal note to a section cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the section but it can certainly be relied upon as indicating the drift of the section or to show what the section dealing with The rule of construction by reference to contemporanea expositio is a well established rule for interpreting a statute by reference to the exposition it has received from contemporary authority though it must give way where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous Having regard to the well recognised rule of interpretation a fair and reasonable construction of section sub section would be to read into it a condition that it would apply only where the consideration for the transfer is understated or in other words the assessee has actually received a larger consideration for the transfer than what is declared in the instrument of transfer and it would have no application in case of a bonafide transaction where the full value of the consideration for the transfer is correctly declared by the assessee Several considerations which lead to this conclusion are a The first consideration is the object and purpose of the enactment of section Further the marginal note to section as it now stands was originally a marginal note only to what is presently sub section and significantly enough this marginal note remained unchanged even after the introduction of sub section suggesting clearly that it was meant by <ORG> to apply to both sub sections of section and it must therefore be taken as indicating That like sub section sub section is also intended to deal with cases where there is under statement of The consideration in respect of the transfer The placement of sub section in section does indicate in some small measure that <ORG> intended that sub section to apply only to cases where the consideration in respect of the transfer is under stated by the assessee If <ORG> intended sub section to cover all cases where the condition of difference is satisfied irrespective of whether there is under statement of consideration or not it is reasonable to assume that <ORG> would have enacted that provision as a separate section and rot pitch forked it into section with a total stranger under an inappropriate marginal note Moreover there is inherent evidence in sub section which suggests that the thrust of that sub section is directed against cases of under statement of consideration A The two circulars issued by <ORG> dated th July and th January are not only binding on <ORG> in administering or executing the provision enacted in sub section but are in nature of contemporenea expositio furnishing legitimate aid in the construction of sub section To throw the burden of showing that there is no understatement of the consideration on the assessee would be to cast an almost impossible burden upon him to establish the negative namely that he did not receive any consideration beyond that declared by him There are two distinct conditions which have to be satisfied before sub section can be invoked by the <ORG> and the burden of showing that these two conditions are satisfied rests on the <ORG> This condition of or more difference is merely intended to be a safeguard against undue hardship which would be occasioned to the assessee if the inflexible rule of the thumb enacted in sub section were applied in marginal case and it has nothing to do with the question of burden of proof for the burden of establishing that there is understatement of the concide ration in respect of The transfer always rests on the <ORG> It has to be read alongwith section which provides the mode of computation and under which the starting point of computation is the full value of the consideration received or accruing Sub section would therefore on the construction of the <ORG> go outside the legislative power of <ORG> and it would Dot be possible to justify it even as an incidental or ancillary provision or a provision intended to prevent evasion of tax The facts giving rise to the appeal are not very material but since they from the backdrop against which the question arises for consideration we may briefly state them On th April however the Income tax officer issued a notice under section of the Act seeking to reopen the assessment of the assessee for the assessment year and requiring the assessee to submit a return of income within thirty days of the service of the notice The notice did not state what was the income alleged to have escaped assessment but by his subsequent letter dated th March the Income tax officer intimated to the assessee that he proposed to fix the fair market value of the house sold by the assessee on th December at Rs to tax because there was admittedly no under statement A of consideration in respect of the transfer of the house and it was not possible to say that the transfer was effected by the assessee with the object of avoidance or reduction of his liability under section The writ petition came up for hearing before <NAME> sitting as a single Judge of <ORG> and after hearing both parties the learned Judge came to the conclusion that under statement of consideration in respect of the transfer was a necessary condition for attracting the applicability of section sub section and since in the present case there was admittedly no under statement of consideration and it was a perfectly bonafide transaction section sub section had no application and the sum of Rs <ORG> heard the appeal but there was a division of opinion two Judges taking one view and the third Judge taking another While <NAME> agreed substantially with the view taken by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> took a different view and held that in order to bring a case within section sub section it is not at all necessary that there should be under statement of consideration in respect of the transfer and once it is found that the fair market value of the property as on the date of the transfer exceeds the full value of the consideration declared by the assessee in respect of the transfer by an amount of not less than of the value so declared section sub section is straightaway attracted and the fair market value of the property as on the date of the transfer is liable to be taken as the full value of the consideration for the transfer It will be noticed from the above statement of facts that the principal question arising for determination in this appeal turns on the true interpretation of section sub section Section is the charging section and it provides that income tax shall be charged in respect of the total income of the previous year of every person Section defines the scope of total income by providing that the total income of the previous year of a person who is resident shall include all income from whatever source derived which is received or is deemed to be received in India in such year by him or on his behalf or accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during such year or accrues or arises to him outside India during such year Section provides that any profits or gains arising from the transfer of a capital asset effected in the previous year shall be chargeable to income tax under the head capital gains and shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in which the transfer took place The mode of computation of capital gains is laid down in section which provides that the income chargeable under the head capital gains shall be computed by deducting from the full value of the consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset two amounts namely i expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer and ii the cost of acquisition of the capital asset and the cost of any improvement thereto That section consists of two sub sections and runs as follows Where the person who acquires a capital asset from an assessee is directly or indirectly connected with the assessee and the Income tax officer has reason to believe that the transfer was effected with the object of avoidance or reduction of the liability of the assessee under section the full value of the consideration for the transfer shall with the previous approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner be taken to be the fair market value of the capital asset on the date of the transfer There is a marginal note to section which reads Consideration for transfer in cases of under statement It may be pointed out that originally when the Act came to be enacted section consisted of only one provision which is now numbered as sub section I and it was by section of the Finance Act that sub section was added in that section with effect from st April The argument of the <ORG> was and this argument found favour with the majority Judges of <ORG> that on a plain natural construction of the language of section sub section the only condition for attracting the applicability of that provision is that the fair market value of the capital asset transferred by the assessee as on the date of the transfer exceeds the full value of the consideration declared by the assessee in respect of the transfer by an amount of not less than of the value so declared It is an attempt to discover the intent of the legislature from the language used by it and it must always be remembered that language is at best an imperfect instrument for the expression of human thought and as pointed out by Lord <NAME> it would be idle to expect every statutory provision to be drafted with divine prescience and perfect clarity We can do no better than repeat the famous words of Judge <NAME> when he said it is true that the words used even in their literal sense are the primary and ordinarily the most reliable source of interpreting the meaning of any writing be it a statute a contract or anything else We must not adopt a strictly literal interpretation of section sub section but we must construe its language having regard to the object and purpose which the legislature had in view in enacting that provision and in the context of the setting in which it occurs There are many situations where the construction suggested on behalf of the <ORG> would lead to a wholly unreasonable result which could never have been intended by the legislature Can it be contended with any degree of fairness and justice that in such cases where there is clearly no under statement of consideration in respect of the transfer and the transaction is perfectly honest and bonafide and in fact in fulfilment of a contractual obligation the assessee who has sold the property should be liable to pay tax on capital gains which have not accrued or arisen to him It is difficult to conceive of any rational reason why the legislature should have thought it fit to impose liability to tax on an assessee who is bound by law to carry out his contractual obligation to sell the property at the agreed price and honestly carries out such contractual obligation If we may take another illustration let us consider a case where A sells his property to with a stipulation that after some time which may be a couple of years or more he shall resell the property to A for the same price could it be contended in such a case that when transfers the property to A for the same price at which he originally purchased it he should be liable to pay tax on the basis as if he has received the market value of the property as on the date of resale if in the meanwhile the market price has shot up and exceeds the agreed price by more than Many other similar situations can be contemplated where it would be absurd and unreasonable to apply section sub section according to its strict literal construction We think that having regard to this well recognised rule of interpretation a fair and reasonable construction of section sub section would be to read into it a condition that it would apply only where the consideration for the transfer is under stated or in other words the assessee has actually received a larger consideration for the transfer than what is declared in the instrument of transfer and it would have no application in case of a bonafinde transaction where the full value of the consideration for the transfer is correctly declared by the assessee There are several important considerations which incline us to accept this construction of section sub section Prior to the introduction of sub section section consisted only of what is now sub section But it must be noticed that for the purpose of bringing a case within sub section it is not enough merely to show understatement of consideration but it must be further shown that the object of the under statement was to avoid or reduce the liability of the assessee to tax on capital gains Now it is necessary to bear in mind that when capital gains are computed by invoking sub section I it is not any fictional accrual or receipt of income which is brought to tax Once it is found that the consideration in respect of the transfer is understated and the conditions specified in sub section are fulfilled the Income tax Officer will not be called upon to prove the precise extent of the undervaluation or in other words the actual extent of the concealment and the full value of the consideration received for the transfer shall be computed in the manner provided in subsection This becomes clear if we have regard to the object and purpose of the introduction of sub section as appearing from travaux preparatoire relating to the enactment of that provision It is a sound rule of construction of a statute firmly established in England as far back as when <NAME> case was decided that for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general four things are to be discerned and considered What was the common law before the making of the Act What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide What remedy the <ORG> hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the Commonwealth and The true reason of the remedy and then the office of all the Judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy My Lords it appears to me that to construe the Statute in question it is not only legitimate but highly convenient to refer both to the former Act and to the ascertained evils to which the former Act had given rise and to the later Act which provided the remedy Now it is true that the speeches made by the Members of the <ORG> on the floor of the <ORG> when a Bill for enacting a statutory provision is being debated are inadmissible for the purpose of interpreting the statutory provision but the speech made by the Mover of the Bill explaining the reason for the introduction of the Bill can certainly be referred for the purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the legislation and the object and purpose for which the legislation is enacted It is apparent from the speech of the Finance Minister that sub section was enacted for the purpose of reaching those cases where there was under statement of consideration in respect of the transfer or to put it differently the actual consideration received for the transfer was considerably more than that declared or shown by the assessee but which were not covered by sub section because the transferee was not directly or indirectly connected with the assessee It is undoubtedly true that the marginal note to a section cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the section but it can certainly be relied upon as indicating the drift of the section or to use the words of <NAME> MR in <NAME> Hammond to show what the section is dealing with as it now stands was originally a marginal note only to what is presently sub section I and significantly enough this marginal note remained unchanged even after the introduction of sub section suggesting clearly that it was meant by <ORG> to apply to both sub sections of section and it must therefore be taken as indicating that like sub section sub section is also intended to deal with cases where there is under statement of the consideration in respect of the transfer It is not altogether without significance that the provision in sub section was enacted by <ORG> not as a separate section but as part of section which as it originally stood dealt only with cases of under statement of consideration If <ORG> intended sub section to cover all cases where the condition of difference is satisfied irrespective of whether there is understatement of consideration or not it is reasonable to assume that <ORG> would have enacted that provision as a separate section and not pitch forked it into section with a total stranger under an inappropriate marginal note Moreover there is inherent evidence in sub section which suggests that the thrust of that sub section is directed against cases of under statement of consideration There is also one other circumstance which strongly reinforces the view we are taking in regard to the construction of sub section Soon after the introduction of sub section <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred under section of the Act issued a circular dated th July explaining the scope and object of sub section in the following words Section of the Finance Act has introduced a new sub section in section of the Income tax Act with a view to countering evasion of tax on capital gains through the device of an under statement of the full value of the consideration received or receivable on the transfer of a capital asset The provision existing in section of the Income tax Act before the amendment which has now been remembered as sub section enables the computation of capital gains arising on transfer of a capital asset with or indirectly connected with assessee and the Income tax officer has reason to believe that the transfer was effected with object of avoidance or reduction of the liability of assessee to tax of capital gains In view of these conditions this provision has a limited operation and does not apply to other cases where the tax liability on capital gains arising on transfer of capital A assets between parties not connected with each other is sought to be avoided or reduced by an under statement of the consideration paid for the transfer of the asset The circular also drew the attention of Income tax Authorities to the assurance given by the Finance Minister in his speech that sub section was not aimed at perfectly honest and bonafide transactions where the consideration in respect of the transfer was correctly disclosed or declared by the assessee but was intended to deal only with cases where the consideration for the transfer was under stated by the assessee and was shown at a lesser figure than that actually received by him It appears that despite this circular <ORG> in several cases levied tax by invoking the provision in sub section even in cases where the transaction was perfectly honest and bonafide and there was no under statement of the consideration This was quite contrary to the instructions issued in the circular which was binding on <ORG> and <ORG> was therefore constrained to issue another circular on th January whereby <ORG> after reiterating the assurance given by the Finance Minister in the course of his speech pointed out It has come to the notice of the <ORG> that in some cases the Income tax officers have invoked the provisions of section even when the transactions were bonafide The rule of construction by reference to contemporanea expositio is a well established rule for interpreting a statute by reference to the exposition it has received from contemporary authority though it must give way where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous This rule has been succinctly and felicitously expressed in Crawford on Statutory Construction ed where it is stated in paragraph that administrative construction i The validity of this rule was also recognised in <NAME> <NAME> where <NAME> stated the rule in these terms It is a well settled principle of interpretation that courts in construing a statute will give much weight to the interpretation put upon it at the time of its enactment and since by those whose duty it has been to construe execute and apply it The question which arose in <NAME> case supra was in regard to the constitutional validity of sections A and which were introduced in the Indian Income Tax Act by the Finance Act with effect from st April The <ORG> however relied on a circular issued by the Central Board of <ORG> under section of the Indian lncome tax Act which corresponded to section of the Present Act and this circular provided that if any such outstanding loans or advances of past years were repaid on or before th June they would not be taken into account in determining the tax liability of the shareholders to whom such loans or advances were given This circular was clearly contrary to the plain language of section A and section but even so this Court held that it was binding on the <ORG> and since past transactions which would normally have attracted the stringent provisions of section as it was introduced in were substantially granted exemption from the operation of the said provisions by making it clear to all the companies and their shareholders that if the past loans were genuinely refunded to the companies they would not be taken into account under section sections A and did not suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality This decision was followed in <ORG> case supra where referring to another circular issued by the Central Board of <ORG> under section of the Indian Income Tax Act on which reliance was placed on behalf of the assessee this Court observed Now coming to the question as to the effect of instructions issued under section of the Act <ORG> observed in <NAME> <NAME> Appellate Assistant Commissioner Bombay The directions given in that circular clearly deviated from the provisions of the Act yet this Court held that circular was binding on the Income tax officers The two circulars of <ORG> referred to above must therefore be held to be binding on the <ORG> in the administration or implementation of sub section and this sub section must be read as applicable only to cases where there is under statement of the consideration in respect of the transfer There are two distinct conditions which have to be satisfied before sub section can be invoked by the <ORG> and the burden of showing that these two conditions are satisfied rests on the <ORG> It is a well settled rule of law that the onus of establishing that the conditions of taxability are fulfilled is always on the <ORG> and the second condition being as much a condition of taxability as the first the burden lies on the <ORG> to show that there is understatement of the consideration and the second condition is fulfilled Moreover to throw the burden of showing that there is no understatement of the consideration on the assessee would be to cast an almost impossible burden upon him to establish the negative namely that he did not receive any consideration beyond that declared by him But the question then arises why has <ORG> introduced the first condition as a pre requisite for the applicability of subsection Why has <ORG> provided that in order to attract the applicability of sub section the fair market value of the capital asset as on the date of the transfer should exceed by or more the full value of the consideration for the transfer declared by the assessee The answer is obvious This condition of or more difference is merely intended to be a safeguard against under hardship which would be occasioned to the assessee if the inflexible rule of the thumb enacted in sub section were applied in marginal cases and it has nothing to do with the question of burden of proof for the burden of establishing that there is under statement of the consideration in respect of the transfer always rests on the <ORG> It is therefore clear that sub section cannot be invoked by A the <ORG> unless there is under statement of the consideration in respect of the transfer and the burden of showing that there is such under statement is on the <ORG> It has to be read alongwith section which provides the mode of computation and under which the starting point of computation is the full value of the consideration received or accruing Moreover if sub section is literally construed as applying even to cases where the full value of the consideration in respect of the transfer is correctly declared or disclosed by the assessee and there is no understatement of the consideration it would result in an amount being taxed which has neither accrued to the assessee nor been received by him and which from no view point can be rationally considered as capital gains or any other type of income Sub section would therefore on the construction of the <ORG> go outside the legislative power of <ORG> and it would not be possible to justify it even as an incidental or ancillary provision or a provision intended to prevent evasion of tax This burden may be discharged by the <ORG> by establishing facts and circumstances from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the assessee has not a correctly declared or disclosed the consideration received by him and there is understatement of concealment of the consideration in respect of the transfer Sub section has no application in case of an honest and bonafide transaction where the consideration received by the assessee has been correctly declared or disclosed by him and there is no concealment or suppression of the consideration shown to be the consideration for the property in the Instrument of Transfer and there was understatement or concealment of the consideration in respect of the transfer Therefore on the construction placed by us subsection had no application to the present case and the Income tax officer could have no reason to believe that any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment so as to justify the issue of a notice under section The order of re assessment made by the Income tax officer pursuant to the notice issued under section was accordingly without jurisdiction and the majority judges of <ORG> were in error in refusing to quash it We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order passed by <ORG> and restore the order of Issac allowing the writ petition and quashing the order of re assessment made by the Income tax officer The <ORG> will pay the costs of the assessee throughout
