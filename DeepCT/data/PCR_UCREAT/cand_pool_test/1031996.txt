On the th August certain vendors sold the property to certain vendees <NAME> the contesting defendant brought a suit for pre emption against the vendees and obtained a decree on the th March He obtained possession under the said decree The present plaintiffs who are eight in number brought the present suit on the th July for a share in the property so pre empted <ORG> instance acceded to this contention and dismissed the suit but the lower appellate Court has come to a contrary conclusion It cannot be doubted that before the passing of the Agra Pre emption Act the mere fact that a rival pre emptor had obtained a decree for pre emption did not prevent other rival pre emptors from claiming a share in the property as against him provided their suit was instituted within one year from the sale it was pointed out that a right of pre emption was not a right of repurchase but a right of substitution for the original vendee and that under the decrees in favour of the rival pre emptors there has not been any fresh transfer in their favour but they have been put in the places of the original vendees Section of the Act cannot apply to the case where one rival pre emptor has obtained a decree for pre emption first The expression where the purchaser has transferred the property in dispute to a person having a right of pre emption etc cannot cover the case of a pre emptor obtaining a decree for pre emption for as pointed out by us that is not a case of a transfer by the vendee to the pre emptor In our opinion therefore the view taken by the learned District Judge was correct and the present plaintiffs are entitled to their proportionate share in the preempted property
