The first of these grounds clearly fails The complaint of the opposite party <NAME> undoubtedly charges the petitioner with conduct which prima facie amounts to the offence of defamation It charges the petitioner with having defamed the opposite party by means of oral statements made to other persons and by having presented a petition to the District Registrar of Assurances representing that a deed of release purporting to have been executed by her in favour of <NAME> was a forgery and that <NAME> had at the time of its registration falsely caused some one to personate her <NAME> and to register the deed in her name Secondly it has been held in a <ORG> decision of this Court that this Court has no power to direct that criminal proceedings should be stayed until the disposal of a civil appeal in which the question at issue in these criminal proceedings shall have been decided In the matter of <NAME> But whatever the rule pi <ORG> may be there is no decision of this Court in any way weakening the force of the decision of the <ORG> of this Court referred to above Finally I would observe that it seems very doubtful if we have any power to pass the order we are invited to pass viz Section read with Section authorises us to interfere in the case of an acquittal of a conviction and of an appeal from any other order He invites us to quash the Magistrate implied order as he says to go on with the proceedings The provisions of Section of this <ORG> Charter of would also not seem to give us power to interfere in this case Section of the Letters Patent of gives us power to revise all such criminal cases tried by any officer or <ORG> possessing criminal jurisdiction as were formerly subject to revision by the High <ORG> But here it appears to me there is no case tried by any officer or <ORG> possessing criminal jurisdiction for us to revise In the Full Bench decision of this <ORG> in the matter of the petition of <NAME> which is said to support that view the question arose whether when <ORG> directs that criminal proceedings should be taken against a party to a suit before it for perjury or forgery <ORG> has power on an appeal being preferred against the decision of that <ORG> to direct the proceedings in <ORG> to be stayed until the appeal shall have been heard and determined The case was governed by the Criminal Procedure Code of and it was held that as no appeal was given either by the Code of Criminal or Civil Procedure against orders which were left to the discretion of <ORG> either granting or revoking sanction to criminal prosecution under Section or Section or against an order sending a case for investigation before a Magistrate under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that inasmuch as no special provision had been made by that Code for cases of sanction under Section or Section or in respect of orders for investigation under Section this <ORG> had no authority either in the exercise of civil or criminal jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against any such sanction or order and Sir <NAME> further observed that it cannot as <ORG> reverse such sanction or order upon the ground that it was not warranted by the facts for as <ORG> it cannot reverse an order except for error in law and further if the <ORG> as a <ORG> of Appeal or as <ORG> cannot reverse or alter such an order I cannot see any inherent authority which it has to stay proceedings The powers given to this <ORG> by the Code of were very nearly the same Section authorizes a <ORG> when it is of opinion that there is ground for enquiring into any offence referred to in Section to send the case for enquiry or trial to a Magistrate and under Section this <ORG> may in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred on a <ORG> of Appeal by Sections and So that it appears to be quite clear that in matters falling either under Section or under Section this <ORG> has the power to interfere with a sanction given under Section or an order for prosecution made under Section And I might here refer to the case of Jankee Bullubh Sen also decided by a Full Bench of this <ORG> where although this <ORG> declined to interfere with the order of the Civil <ORG> for the prosecution of a witness in a Criminal <ORG> they did not doubt their power to interfere under their general powers of superintendence over the lower <ORG>s That this <ORG> has often interfered with the orders made under Sections and will be seen from the case of In the matter of <NAME> and in the case of <NAME> it was held that under Section of the Code this <ORG> has the power to interfere with the order of a Subordinate <ORG> whether made under Section or Section of the Criminal Procedure Code and to determine whether the discretion conferred by those sections has or has not been properly exercised In the first mentioned case of <NAME> it was also held that if this <ORG> had the power to interfere with an order under Section it had equally the power to deal with the order that resulted from it namely the issue of warrants under that section I might here add that Section of the Charter Act gives <ORG> powers of general superintendence over all <ORG>s subject to their appellate jurisdiction and Section of the Letters Patent declares that <ORG> of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal shall be <ORG> from the Criminal <ORG>s subject to its appellate jurisdiction and that it is empowered to revise all cases tried by any Officer or <ORG> possessing criminal jurisdiction subordinate to <ORG> Section lays down that <ORG> shall have power to direct the transfer of any criminal case or appeal from any <ORG> to any other <ORG> of equal or superior jurisdiction and also to direct the preliminary investigation or trial of any criminal case by any Officer or <ORG> otherwise competent to investigate or try it though such case belongs in ordinary coarse to the jurisdiction of some other Officer or <ORG> And I do not see why if this <ORG> is possessed of all these large powers it has not the power to order a Magistrate to stay proceedings if a sufficient cause in that behalf is made out At the same time I feel bound to say that when the <ORG> has given to a Magistrate the power to regulate the proceedings in his own <ORG> the discretion should ordinarily be left to the Magistrate either to stay proceedings or not as he in the circumstances of the case may think it right and proper The Magistrate does not seem to have made any order on this petition but he passed certain orders upon subsequent dates the effect whereof was to continue the proceedings But it would appear that though theoretically the prosecution is on behalf of the <ORG> it is in form and in substance see the summons issued and the proceedings a prosecution by <NAME> who is the defendant in the civil suit and I am not prepared to say that the decision in the civil suit would not be admissible in evidence in the criminal case if as I understand it to be the main issue in both the cases is identically the same No <ORG> can take cognizance of an offence like this except upon a complaint made by the person aggrieved thereby In such a case it seems to me rather undesirable that both the civil and criminal cases should go on simultaneously at one and the same time
