Later on the post was made permanent and the petitioner was confirmed but shortly afterwards the Divisional Forest Officer passed and order that the orders of confirmation should not be given effect to and the petitioner was informed that his services were no longer required On appeal to <ORG> the petitioner was informed by the Conservator that the order terminating his services was cancelled and that he was reinstated It was also urged by Mr <NAME> that the petitioner as a temporary employee of the <ORG> cannot challenge the order of dismissal on the plea that it violated the constitutional protection granted to civil servants under Article of the Constitution it being open to the <ORG> Government or to an officer competent in that behalf to dismiss the petitioner from service having regard to the precarious nature of the tenure of his employment According to Mr <NAME> Article of the Constitution confers a protection only upon civil servants who are permanently employed in certain posts and a temporary servant cannot claim protection of Article against dismissal or discharge from service Article of the Constitution provides that every member of a civil service of the <ORG> or of an all India service or who holds any civil post under the <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or who holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> By clause of Article it is provided that no person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> or an all India service or a civil service of a <ORG> or holds a civil post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him The expression no person in Clause of Article in our Judgment includes all civil servants whether they have been appointed temporarily as members of a civil service or as permanent employees and there is nothing implicit In the context of Article or in Its content which supports the plea that protection is conferred only upon persons who have been permanently appointed to a post in the civil service of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> In the view we are taking we are supported by the observations made in a judgment of this Court <NAME> <ORG> A The plaintiff then filed a suit challenging the order and he invoked the provisions of of the <ORG> of India Act and contended that he was dismissed from service without any reasonable opportunity being given to him to show cause against the charge that he was permanently incapacitated It was held by this Court that the order was not an order of dismissal or removal from service and therefore the plaintiff could not contend that he was entitled to the rights given to an employee under Section of the <ORG> of India Act It was observed in that case that it is only in cases falling within Article or Section that the <ORG> as an employer is bound to conform to certain rules of natural justice indicated in that article and that section It is evident from these observations that the <ORG> took the view that even in respect of temporary employee if an order of dismissal or removal from service is passed the employee is entitled to claim the benefit of Article of the Constitution and if no reasonable opportunity is afforded to him to show cause against the proposed action the dismissal or removal from service wilt be regarded as ineffective Mr <NAME> invited our attention to certain unreported judgments delivered by Mr Justice <NAME> in which it was opined that the observations set out by us are mere dicta and that the true rule applicable to temporary employees of a Government department is that they are liable to be dismissed or discharged from service without being afforded an opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against them Now the order passed against the plaintiff in <NAME> case was one of discharge from service it was not in terms an order of dismissal or removal from service nor was it an order terminating the employment of the plaintiff If the order was one of dismissal or removal from service the provisions of Article of the Constitution and Section of the Government of India Act were it was observed attracted and the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of an enquiry and of being afforded an opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him Articles and of the Constitution do not make any distinction between members of a civil service who are permanently employed in certain posts and those who are temporarily employed When an employee of the <ORG> or the <ORG> is dismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank the order necessarily involves some stigma and the Constitution Has provided that before that stigma attaches to the employee he must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him The plea that a temporary employee may not be given that opportunity of showing cause and a permanent employee alone may be given that opportunity is not sought to be sustained on any rational principle A temporary civil servant has also some expectation of being continued in his employment and so long as his employment continues he must in our judgment have the same rights and privileges as the civil servants holding permanent posts have It is always open to the <ORG> Government or the <ORG> Government to terminate the employment of a civil servant and a bona fide termination of employment does not attract the operation of Article of the Constitution It is only when an order of dismissal removal or reduction in rank is passed that the civil servant can claim an opportunity of showing cause In <NAME> State of Uttar Pradesh their Lordships of <ORG> dealt with the question whether compulsory retirement of an employee holding a permanent post amounted to dismissal or removal from service Removal like dismissal no doubt brings about a termination of service but every termination of service does not amount to dismissal or removal It is true that in <NAME> case the civil servant concerned was a permanent employee but it was held that compulsory retirement of that civil servant was not removal or dismissal from service and he was therefore not entitled to be afforded an opportunity under Article of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him Article has undoubtedly a limited operation its protection avails an employee against an order of dismissal removal or reduction in rank but in our judgment within the ambit of its operation the Article applies to all employees whether they are permanently employed or temporarily employed In accordance with the <ORG> rules which formed part of the contract he was discharged from service after notice The employee then filed a petition under Article of the Constitution seeking redress for infringement of his fundamental rights under Articles and of the Constitution It wag held by their Lordships of <ORG> that Article had no application because there was neither a dismissal nor a removal from service nor a reduction in rank Article had no application But Mr <NAME> relied upon the observation made at page of the report to the following effect When the employment is permanent there are certain statutory guarantees but in the absence of any such limitations <ORG> is subject to the qualification mentioned above as free to make special contracts of service with temporary employees engaged in works of a temporary nature as any other employer There is nothing in the observation which supports the plea that where the employment is not permanent the statutory guarantee under Article does not protect the civil servant That is clear from the reference made to the judgment in Misc Appln As we have already pointed out an order of dismissal or removal from service or reduction in rank attracts the provisions of Article but not a mere termination of employment whether the employee is holding a permanent post or is temporarily employed Mr Justice <NAME> also relied upon the analogy of reversion of a probationer to a subordinate post and observed In its very essence a person on probation may be removed from the post to which he is appointed at any time during the period of probation or on the expiry of it Article confers a right on the member of <ORG> or a person who holds a civil post and in my opinion these phrases are not capable of including within their scope persons who by the very terms of their appointment are liable to be removed from the posts during the period of probation In that judgment Mr Justice <NAME> also expressed the view that the observations made in the judgment in <NAME> case A to which we have already referred were mere dicta and were not binding We may point out that whereas Mr Justice <NAME> observed that the Provision of section of the Government of India Act had never been made applicable to the case of a probationer our attention was invited to an unreported judgment of this Court in <NAME> Appeal No of Bom which lays down a different rule It was held in that case that Rule of the Police Rules assumed that a person appointed on probation had the right to hold that appointment for the period of his appointment and he could not be dismissed or discharged before the expiry of the period of probation The learned Chief Justice in delivering the judgment of the Court observed If a person is appointed oil probation for one year or two years or a person is appointed for a definite period one year two years or less or more under the contract he is entitled to hold that Post for that period and if the Commissioner of Police wants to dispense with his service prior to that period then he has the same rights and privileges as a permanent employee and for a very good reason because he has as much right during that definite period to continue to hold that office as a permanent employee has and therefore to that extent no distinction can be made between a permanent police officer and a police officer appointed on probation for a fixed period or appointed to a post for a definite period In our opinion the principle of that case also supports the view which we are willing to take in the case before us We therefore negative the contention raised by Mr <NAME> that the circumstance that the petitioner is a temporary employee is sufficient to disentitle him to the statutory protection under Article of the Constitution
