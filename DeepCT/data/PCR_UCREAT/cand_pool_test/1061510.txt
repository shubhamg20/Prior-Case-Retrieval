On the appellant appeared and wanted time for filing objections but no objections were filed and the company judge by its order dated directed the official liquidator to sell the said assets and realise the price thereon <ORG> of <ORG> dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant against the order of the court directing the sale of the articles on the ground that as this court by virtue of its interim order dt that it applies merely to proceedings for the winding up of a textile company so as to defeat the very object of the Management Act The express provision of of the Nationalisation Act clearly voided the sale which took place under the orders of the company judge after the Act would be deemed to have come into force <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> for <NAME> <NAME> for Respondents and The Judgment of <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave turns upon the interpretation of an interim order passed by this Court on th September in a writ petition challenging the validity of the Sick Textile undertakings Taking over of Management Act as also the impact of the Sick Textile Undertakings Nationalisation Act on the proceedings taken in this case both before and after the passing of the interim order by this Court In order to appreciate the point in controversy in the instant case it may be necessary to give a brief survey of the facts leading up to the impugned order delivery of by the purchasers <ORG> who had to pay Rs An appeal was filed against the order of the court dated to <ORG> but the same was dismissed On th April the appellant <ORG> appeared and wanted time for filing objections but no objections were filed and the Company Judge by its order dated th June directed <ORG> to sell the aforementioned assets and realise the price thereon No appeal against this order was filed by the appellant <ORG> On the th June certain directions were sought by <ORG> for approving the proposed purchasers which was granted The appellant <ORG> filed an appeal before <ORG> against the order of the <ORG> directing the sale of the articles which was however dismissed by <ORG> of the Bombay High <ORG> mainly on the ground that as this <ORG> by virtue of its interim order dated had authorised the sale of the articles the <ORG> was fully justified in ordering the sale of those articles It is against this order of the High <ORG> that the appellant has come up in appeal by special leave We have heard counsel for the parties and have also perused the judgment of <ORG> and we feel that <ORG> has not properly construed the interim order of this <ORG> and was tinder an erroneous impression of law that this <ORG> by its interim order had in fact authorised the sale which in law was invalid In the writ petition in which the interim order of this <ORG> was passed the vires of The Management Act was challenged and it would appear from the reliefs sought ill the petition that there was an express prayer for suspending the provisions of the Act When this Court passed the interim order dated and allowed the liquidation proceeding to continue it only meant that the proceedings should continue in accordance with law and if the law enjoined any condition the same must be complied with It was however suggested on behalf of the respondents that section would have no application to the facts of the present case inasmuch as that section applied merely to proceedings for the winding up of a textile company In these circunstances we are unable to accede to the argument put forward by the counsel for the respondents It was rightly submitted by counsel for the appellant that <ORG> appears to have completely lost sight of the effect of the Nationalisation Act which bad been given retrospective effect For these reasons therefore we are clearly of the opinion that the express provisions of section clearly voided the sale which took place under orders of the Company Judge after the Act would be deemed to have come into force For the reasons given above the appeal is allowed the order of <ORG> is set aside and the sale held by the Official Liquidator in pursuance of the order of the Company Judge is annulled
