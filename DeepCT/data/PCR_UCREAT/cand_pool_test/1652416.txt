This appeal is directed against an appellate judgment of <ORG> dated the th May which affirmed the judgment of a single Judge of the Original Side of that Court passed on th February in Suit No of To appreciate the points that have been canvassed before us in this appeal it will be necessary to narrate a few antecedent facts about which there is no dispute between the parties It may be stated here that neither side adduced any evidence before the trial judge during the hearing of the case and the questions raised in the suit were argued as questions of law turning on the construction of the indenture which created the endowment as well as of the provisions of the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act Act XVIII of as amended by Act XI of Provided however that in case the said <NAME> shall happen to die without any issue or without giving any authority to his wife him surviving to adopt then in such case it shall be competent for the said <NAME> to appoint by will or otherwise a shebait who would act as such after the death of his said wife as aforesaid but in case the said <NAME> shall happen to die without any issue the shebaitship of the said Thakur after the death of his wife shall devolve upon his heirs under the Hindu Law There was a further prayer claiming a right of residence in premises No Syakrapara Lane The written statement that was filed on behalf of the defendant denied the plaintiff claim of shebaiti right either exclusively in herself or jointly with the defendant and asserted that the defendant was the sole shebait under the terms of the deed of endowment as well as under law It was held further that as the plaintiff was not in law the natural guardian of the defendant she could not claim to exercise the rights of a shebait on behalf of the defendant as his natural guardian so long as the defendant remained a minor Against this decision the plaintiff preferred an appeal which came up for hearing before an appeal Bench of <ORG> consisting of Sir <NAME> and <NAME> The learned counsel appearing in support of the appeal did not seriously challenge that part of the decision of the trial Judge which negatived the plaintiff claim to act as a sole shebait either under the terms of the indenture of endowment or as a guardian of the defendant during the period of his minority The substantial contention raised by Mr <NAME> who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff appellant is that under the clause in the indenture relating to devolution of shebaitship the shebaitship is to go to <NAME> after the death of <NAME> and after her death it is to vest in the heirs of <NAME> Who these heirs are has got to be determined according to the law in force at the time when the succession opened and under the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act which came into force in the year the widow of a propositus who dies intestate would rank as an heir along with the son and would be entitled to the same share as a son gets in the property of the deceased Assuming however for argument sake that the expression property as used in the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act does not include shebaiti right it is argued by the learned counsel that it is a well established proposition of law that succession to shebaitship is governed by the ordinary rules of inheritance in respect to secular property under the Hindu law and as the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act has amended the general law of inheritance in certain matters the same alterations must be recognised in regard to succession to shebaitship as well He contended however that the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act which is a piece of special legislation enacted for a special purpose does not use the expression property in a wide and unlimited sense and it would appeal clear from the provisions of the different sections of the Act that it could not have had in contemplation and does not purport to affect the rules of succession relating to the special and somewhat anomalous type of property which shebaitship admittedly is In a Hindu religious endowment on the other hand the entire ownership of the dedicated property is transferred to the deity or the institution itself as a juristic person and the <ORG> or mahant is a mere manager The <ORG> has not only duties to discharge in connection with the endowment but he has a beneficial interest in the <NAME> property The effect of the first two decisions as <ORG> pointed out in the last case was to emphasize the proprietary element in the <ORG>i right and to show that though in some respects anomalous it was an anomaly to be accepted as having been admitted into Hindu law from an early date Section then provides When a Hindu governed by the Dayabhaga School of Hindu law dies intestate leaving any property and when a Hindu governed by any other school of Hindu law dies intestate leaving separate property his widow or if there is more than one widow all his widows together shall subject to the provisions of sub section be entitled in respect of property in respect of which he dies intestate to the same share as a son Provided that the widow of a predeceased son shall inherit in like manner as a son if there is no son surviving of such predeceased son and shall inherit in like manner as a son son if there is surviving a son or son son of such predeceased son Provided further that the same provision shall apply mutatis mutandis to the widow of a predeceased son of a predeceased son Similar rights have been given by the two provisos attached to section to the widow of a predeceased son and also to the widow of a predeceased son of a predeceased son This is because there are certain limitations and restrictions attached to and inherent in the <NAME>i right itself and they exist irrespective of the fact as to whether the <NAME>ship devolves upon a male or a female heir But although as regards powers of alienation the disability of the male and the female <NAME>s may be identical there is yet a distinction between them as regards the other limitation or characteristic of a Hindu woman estate The language of section of the Act is exactly the same as that of section of the Indian Succession Act and the object underlying both these provisions appears to be identical Thus there is nothing in any of the provisions of the Act from which an inference could be drawn that the expression property as used in section has a limited or restricted interpretation and is not applicable to shebaitship which is recognized as property in Hindu law The deceased was in possession of several trust properties in regard to which there were certain religious and charitable trusts and the direction in the will was that the management of these trusts should devolve upon his heirs The second finding of the trial Judge was that the deceased died intestate with regard to a considerable amount of property and consequently the plaintiff was entitled to a half share thereof The learned Judge observed himself in his judgment that there was little or no evidence as to the terms of the foundations in respect of any of the trusts managed by the deceased At any rate we have no materials to hold that in regard to the trusts that formed the subject matter of that suit the trustees had any beneficial or personal interest in the trust properties In these circumstances no question arises in the present case of controverting the proposition of law that <NAME> purported to lay down namely that the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act could not govern succession to property in respect to which the propositus had no beneficial enjoyment There are indeed one or two observations of the learned Judge in his judgment not very definitely expressed from which it is not impossible to draw an inference in favour of the respondent but we think that they should be construed in the light of the facts and the actual decision in the case But the position would be obviously different if there is a beneficial interest of a substantial kind inseparably connected with the duties of a particular office Our conclusion therefore is that there is nothing in any of the provisions of the Hindu Women Rights Property Act which excludes from the scope of operation of the Act succession to shebaitship is a recognized form of property in Hindu Law Succession of shebaitship even though there is an ingredient of in it follows succession to ordinary or secular property It may be stated at the outset that we are not at all impressed by the argument of the learned counsel that the words heirs of the said <NAME> occurring in the document are to be construed as words not of inheritance but of grant There is no indication of any intention to treat the heirs as the objects of an independent gift It was held by <NAME> that it was not reasonable to construe such words as words of gift and not of devolution The relevant portion of the document has been set out already and it provides in the first place that after the death of <NAME> her son the said <NAME> Mullick shall become the shebait after him his wife <NAME> and after her death the heirs of the said <NAME> Mullick shall be and act as shebaits Then there is a proviso to the effect that if the said <NAME> shall happen to die without any issue or without giving any authority to his wife him surviving to adopt then in such case it shall be competent for <NAME> to appoint by will or otherwise a shebait who would act as such after the death of the said wife but in case the said <NAME> Mullick shall happen to die without any issue the shebaitship of the said <NAME> after the death of his wife shall devolve upon his heirs under Hindu Law We do not think that the interpretation suggested by the learned counsel is the proper one So far as the main provision is concerned there is nothing in the language or in the context to suggest that the word heirs has not been used in its ordinary or natural sense In our opinion the clause that precedes the proviso lays down the general rule relating to devolution of shebaitship The proviso engrafts an exception upon the general rule It may be noted that the word issue includes both son and daughter and the power of appointment cannot be exercised by <NAME> even if he has a daughter living I agree with the conclusion reached by my three learned brothers in the judgment just now pronounced but I would like to add a few words on two points on which I do not see eye to eye with them fully We have in mind the shebaitship itself as a species of property But it does not decisively outweigh the several considerations set forth in the judgment just now delivered by my learned brother <NAME> for construing the word property in a wider sense so as to include the shebaiti right also It there is no legal objection to a woman being a shebait under Hindu law there is no particular reason why she should be excluded from succeeding to the same under an Act which imposes no restriction or prohibition either in express terms or by necessary implication I am of the opinion that the technical rules of interpretation of provisos and exceptions with reference to their scope and legal effect adopted in construing statutes should not ordinarily be imported in interpreting deeds and documents executed by laymen In ordinary deeds a proviso may sometimes be in the nature of an explanation of the main clause or provision and we must look not merely at the form of the language but its substance the governing idea or purpose of the deed the context and the surrounding circumstances togather the real meaning or intention of the executant Judged in this light and adopting a broad construction it appears to me that what <NAME> had in mind when he executed the indenture was as made clear in the proviso that his issue born of his loins or any person whom his wife may adopt on his authority should succeed to the shebaiti in the first instance and secondly in default of such contingency the shebaitship should go to any person who may be nominated in this behalf by his will and thirdly in default of issue born or adopted and in default of nomination by will which is necessarily implied the right was to devolve upon his heirs under the Hindu law
