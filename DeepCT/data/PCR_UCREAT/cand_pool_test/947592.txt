These appeals arise out of a common judgment dated delivered in RSA No and other connected appeals by <ORG> at Chandigarh confirming the judgment of the first appellate court and decreeing the suits of the plaintiffs The plaintiffs who are the respondents in these appeals had filed suits for declaration and mandatory injunction against the appellant herein namely <ORG> for short the <ORG> to allot them plots in lieu of lands acquired from them The trial court in some cases decreed the suit and in others dismissed the suit The claim of the respondents in all these appeals arises on the basis that they are all local displaced persons who are entitled to a plot each in lieu of the lands acquired from them by the appellant <ORG> in view of the preference given to such local displaced persons under the allotment rules Acquisitions involved in these appeals are made under Section of the Punjab Town Improvement Act for short the Improvement Act which empowers the authorities concerned to prepare and publish improvement schemes within the local areas concerned Section thereof empowers <ORG> to make rales consistent with the Act and applicable to all improvement trusts including the appellant herein Rule of the said rales defines local displaced person as a person whose property has been acquired by <ORG> execution of a scheme under the Punjab Development of Damaged Areas Act for short the Damaged Areas Act Rule of the said Rules defines local displaced person as follows Local displaced person means a person who is the owner of any land acquired by the <ORG> for the execution of any scheme under the Act and who has been such owner for a continuous period of two years immediately before the first publication of such scheme by the <ORG> under Section So far as the and Rules are concerned the definition of local displaced person applies to a person whose property has been acquired and who has been owner of such property for a continuous period of two years immediately before the first publication of the scheme by the <ORG> Thus it is seen from all these three set of rules that in order to have the benefit of a preferential allotment reserved for a local displaced person there are certain qualifying standards Unless and until a person who wants to take benefit of the preferential reservation qualifies to be a local displaced person the said benefit is not available to him In the suits filed by the respondents the main claim of the plaintiffs was that they were local displaced persons inasmuch as under the various schemes executed by the <ORG> their lands had been acquired and therefore they became local displaced persons entitled for preferential allotment in their favour It was also contended on behalf of some of the respondents that the <ORG> had initially made allotments in their favour pursuant to which they had even deposited certain sums of money hence it is not open to the <ORG> to cancel the allotments It is contended on behalf of the appellant before us that none of the respondents plaintiffs qualify to be local displaced person so as to entitle him for a preferential allotment under the category of local displaced person From the said Chart it is seen that the Notification under Section applicable to the acquisitions of the respondents in these appeals are dated and a date anterior to the coming into force of the and Rules Since it is the respondents who claim preferential allotment under the Rules the onus is on them to establish the fact that they do fall within the definition of the local displaced persons so as to entitle them to the benefit of preferential allotment As a matter of fact it seems that the courts below have proceeded on the basis that all persons whose lands have been acquired for the execution of any scheme by the <ORG> automatically become local displaced persons In the said case the appellant before this <ORG> challenged the validity of a notice issued under Section of the Improvement Act as also the Award dated made by the Collector determining the compensation for the land acquired under the impugned Notification this <ORG> while refusing to quash the notice under Section of the Act came to the conclusion that the amount awarded as compensation for the acquisition of the land was patently inequitable inasmuch as that while the appellant purchased the land from <ORG> at the price of Rs this <ORG> however observed in para of the judgment as thus Only one aspect remains to be dealt with Dr <NAME> urged that whenever land of anyone was acquired for the purpose of scheme each such owner whose land was acquired was allotted one plot admeasuring Kanal at reserved price We see no justification in treating the appellant differently The observations made in para of the said judgment was based on a submission of the learned Counsel and not based on any principle of law Therefore we are of the opinion that the said judgment does not lay down as a proposition of law that every person whose land is acquired for the purpose of execution of a scheme under the Improvement Act will be entitled to preferential allotment of a plot as a local displaced person Therefore the courts below came to the conclusion that even the plaintiffs respondents were entitled to such allotment In our opinion before coming to this conclusion the courts below should have first decided the question whether the allotment in favour of those persons was within the scope of the Rules applicable Here the courts below have failed to notice the legal principle that there is no estoppel against law In the said view of the matter we are unable to sustain the judgments and decrees impugned in these appeals We direct the <ORG> to refund all such amounts deposited pursuant to the allotments in question made in favour of such of those respondents herein with per cent interest per annum from the date of deposit till the date of payment For the reasons stated above these appeals are hereby allowed setting aside the judgments and decrees impugned in these appeals
