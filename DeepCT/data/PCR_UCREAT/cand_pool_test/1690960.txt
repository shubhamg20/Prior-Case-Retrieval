It was contended on behalf of the respondent that in the circumstances stated above the appellant must be deemed to have been satisfied with the Judgment of the High Court as his Counsel did not ask for leave to file a Letters Patent appeal as required by Order IV Rule of the Rules of the Madras High Court that is to say immediately after the judgment has been delivered It is only where an application for special leave against a second appellate judgment raises issues of law of general importance that the Court would grant the application and proceed to deal with the merits of the contentions raised by the appellant But even in such cases it is necessary that the remedy by way of a Letters Patent Appeal must be resorted to before a party comes to this Court As applications for certification fell outside the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and there was no specific provision for them in the Limitation Act <ORG> could frame its own rule prescribing the mode and time for making such applications In some <ORG> there is no rule of the <ORG> laying down that the application should be oral and made immediately after the judgment has been delivered It is however evident that a rule such as Rule of Order IV <ORG> is most useful and necessary particularly when a period of thirty days only for filing an appeal has been prescribed in There is however another answer to the preliminary objection It was contended that the case before us is covered by what was laid down by this Court in <NAME> case Supra when it said at page we do not think it would be possible to lay down an unqualified rule that leave should not be granted if the party has not moved for leave under the Letters Patent and it cannot be so granted nor is it possible to lay down an inflexible rule that if in such a case leave has been granted it must always and necessarily be revoked Having regard to the wide scope of the powers conferred on this <ORG> under Article it is not possible and indeed it would not be expedient to lay down any general rule which would govern all cases In that particular case this <ORG> had actually heard and allowed the appeal by Special leave because it he that there was no general inflexible rule that special leave should be refused where the appellant has not exhausted his rights by asking for a certificate of fitness of a case and because that case called for interference In the case before us although the appellant was not shown to have attempted any explanation of failure to apply for the certificate at the proper time yet the special leave petition having been granted and the case having passed without objection beyond the stage of interim orders and printing of the records we have heard arguments on merits also The challenge on the ground of lis pendens which had been accepted by the Courts in Madras right up to <ORG> was directed against two kinds of sales firstly there was the ostensibly voluntary sale of under a sale deed by the defendant <NAME> and his major son <NAME> and three minor sons <NAME> <NAME> alias Thanikachalam and <NAME> in favour of the defendant appellant and secondly there was the sale evidenced by the sale certificate Exhibit of showing that the auction sale was held in order to realise certain arrears under hire purchase system due to Shri <NAME> The words due to must in the context be read as due from because falsa demonstration non nocet in favour of <NAME> and he had executed a second mortgage in respect of one item of property of Schedule in favour of <NAME> who had assigned his rights to <NAME> A third mortgage of the first item of Schedule properties was executed on by <NAME> in favour of the appellant <NAME> was said to be necessitated by the need to pay arrears of Rs All these events had taken place before There was nothing in the sale certificate to show that the due for which properties were sold were of anyone other than <NAME> individually <ORG> recorded a finding on which the learned Counsel for the appellant relies strongly There is overwhelming documentary and oral evidence to show that the sale deed Exhibit and the revenue sale are all true and supported by consideration and that the th Defendant would be entitled to them if these sales were not affected by the rule of Lis pendens within the meaning of Section of the Transfer of Property Act It may be mentioned here that the th Defendant is no other than the appellant <NAME> the son in law of defendant respondent <NAME> who had purchased the properties covered by both the impugned sales the language of Section has been held to be applicable not only to private transfers but also to <ORG> sales held in execution of decrees The suggestion made on behalf of the appellant that attachment of some schedule property before judgment in the purchaser mortgage suit could remove it from the ambit of Lis pendens is quite unacceptable <ORG> had rightly distinguished cases cited on behalf of the appellant before it by holding that exemption from the scope of lis pendens cannot be extended to voluntary sales in any case Obviously its view was that even where a voluntary sale takes place in order to satisfy the decretal amount in a mort gage suit the result of such a sale was not the same as that of an involuntary sale in the course of execution proceedings where land is sold to satisfy the decree on the strength of a mortgage which creates an interest in the property mortgaged That was a case in which before the deposit of money by the preemptors in a suit to enforce their rights to pre emption the vendee had sold his rights to the appellant who had an equal right of pre emption We think that this decision turns upon its own facts and on the nature of the right of preemption which as was observed there is a weak right The observations made by this Court with regard to the doctrine of lis pendens when a plaintiff is enforcing a right of pre emption must we think be confined to cases of sales which could defeat preemptors claims It has to be remembered that a technical rule of the law of pre emption is that the preemptor to succeed in his suit must continue to possess the right to pre empt until the decree for possession is passed in his favour Subject to such rules as may be made under Section all loans granted under this Act all interest if any chargeable thereon and costs if any incurred in making the same shall when they become due be recoverable by the Collector in all or any of the following modes namely a from the borrower as if they were arrears of land revenue due by him from his surety if any as if they were arrears of land revenue due by him out of the land for the benefit of which the loan has been granted as if they were arrears of land revenue due in respect of that land out of the property comprised in the collateral security if any according to the procedure for the realization of land revenue by the sale of immovable property other than the land on which that revenue is due Provided that no proceeding in respect of any land under clause shall affect any interest in that land which existed before the date of the order granting the loan other than the interest of the borrower and of mortgages of or persons having charges on that interest and where the loan is granted under Section with the consent of another person the interest of that person and of mortgagees of or persons having charges on that interest Apart of the fact that there is no claim by the <ORG> before us we may observe that where a statutory provision is relied upon for recovery of dues the effect of it must be confined to what the statute enacts The doctrine however as would be evident from <NAME> work mentioned above is derived from the rules of jus gentium which became embodied in the Roman Law where we find the maxim Rem de qua controversia prohibemur in acrum dedicare a thing concerning which there is a controversy is prohibited during the suit from being alienated For the reasons given above there is no force in this appeal which is dismissed with costs I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by my brother <NAME> but as I arrive at the same conclusion by a slightly different route I am writing a separate judgment He filed a written statement inter alia alleging that the Plaint Schedule properties were the sole and absolute properties of the st defendant Additional issues were framed in the suit There was no publication It protected the interest of the th defendant by stating that as far as possible the Commissioner to be appointed in the suit for division of the properties will allot to the plaintiff share such of the properties which are not covered by Exs The learned Judge who heard the appeal by his order dated September refused the leave on the ground that the leave was not asked for immediately on delivery of judgment and that it could not be asked for afterwards Clause of the Letters Patent confers powers on the High <ORG> to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all proceedings in civil cases of the Letters Patent which is in similar terms as Clause mentioned above <ORG> of Judicature at Lahore had the power to make a rule prescribing the period of limitation in respect of appeals from Orders made by that <ORG> in exercise of its original jurisdiction to <ORG> of that <ORG> It seems to me that <ORG> can equally frame a rule regulating the time at which and the manner in which the application for a certificate shall be made It was said that the rule unduly restricts the right of the litigant to peruse the judgment and make up his mind whether to appeal or not But if the declaration is made immediately by the Judge that the case is fit one for appeal there is nothing to prevent the litigant from not filing the appeal if he considers it inadvisable to do so There is no difficulty in holding that Ex since the result must bind the party to it so must it bind the person deriving his right title and interest from or through him If the principle of lis pendens applies to court auctions there is no reason why it should not apply to revenue sales If there is a valid charge or mortgage on a property this does not vanish because the property becomes the subject matter of a partition suit
