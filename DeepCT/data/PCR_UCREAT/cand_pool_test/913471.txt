The manufacturers or dealers were prohibited from selling or offering for sale or otherwise transferring or disposing of the motor cars for a price exceeding the price given in the order The Government accordingly appointed a <ORG> of three members headed by a retired High <ORG> Judge and by a notification dated June all the provisions of the <ORG> of Enquiry Act were made applicable to the <ORG> It was considered necessary to determine the price in September because the impugned order was promulgated at that time For the September prices the computation was done according to the historical method which meant that not only the prices in September were kept in view but also the value of pending stocks of raw materials and the average of the price at which purchases had been effected at that time were taken into account The findings of the <ORG> were criticised by the writ petitioners on the following grounds That the <ORG> had taken the production capacity at an excessive figure and had thus artificially reduced the cost ii that cost and expenses on account of warranty and statutory bonus had been wrongly excluded from the ex works cost iii that in fixing the cost for September even the actual admitted cost found by the <ORG> had not been taken into account and the price had been fixed on the historical cost whereas in fixing the price for July the projected and estimated cost for July had been ignored iv that no pro vision had been made for an escalation clause in order to ensure that the prices fixed would ensure for a reasonable period of time that the return which bad been allowed was wholly inadequate on the admitted and proved facts and vi that the depreciation of plant and machinery had been allowed on the basis of original cost whereas it should have been allowed on the replacement value or on the peculiar facts of the case There was no justification for rejecting the opinion of the experts especially when no member of the team was examined as a witness for finding out those facts and data which the <ORG> had sought to use for rejecting the technical team report If it is to be included in the ex works cost it would mean virtually passing it on to the consumer Al The question whether bonus is linked with profit or cost stands concluded by the provisions of the Bonus Act itself as also the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> case iii There was no authority or principle on which the method of calculating the ex works cost on historical basis could be justifiably adopted for September when a different method was adopted for July cost There was no principle which had been demonstrated to be wrong in the report of the Com mission so far as the fixation of the return was concerned The depreciation which is allowed under the tax laws is very liberal and there is no reason to pass on the burden to the present consumer who is not likely to get any benefit out of the replacement proposed to be provided for by the manufacturers There was no serious infirmity or flaw in the reasoning or the conclusion of the <ORG> on the question of depreciation A ALSO HELD The amount payable on account of royalty per car in the case of <ORG> pursuant to the collaboration agreement the renewal of which had been approved by <ORG> must be included in the ex works cost for July The conclusion of the <ORG> relating to the percentage of the local steel sheets by the <ORG> Motors was correct On the relationship between taxation and the high prices of cars the <ORG> observed It will not be out of place to notice a few observations of expert bodies about taxation which forms at least one third part of the price of a car The car is no longer an item of luxuryand under the existing conditions it is fast becoming an item of necessity That being so there is a case for giving some relief out of the excise duties and other levies which are by their nature multi point taxes causing hardship A Per <NAME> Partly dissenting The production capacity which has to be taken into account is the achievable capacity of a plant run in a reasonably efficient manner It is wellknown that admissions constitute a strong piece of evidence against the party making the admissions and it is for that party to show that the admissions are mistaken or are not true From <ORG> own report it was clear that neither any physical verification could be made by <ORG>am nor could it make a systematic study and it had to content itself with the materials supplied by the petitioner company There was nothing to indicate that any attempt was made before the Committee to show that the achievable capacity of the petitioner company was more than what was stated on behalf of the petitioner In these circumstances there was no reason to rely on the recommendations of <ORG> or <ORG> in preference to the findings of the <ORG> A JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos and of The manufacturers or dealers were prohibited from selling or offering for sale or otherwise transferring or disposing of the motor cars for a price exceeding the price given in the Order By a notifica tion dated June all the provisions of the <ORG> of Enquiry Act were made applicable to the <ORG> The <ORG> considered it necessary to introduce a Distribution Control Order which required the dealer to deliver vehicles in the order of registration and without discrimination A committee was appointed consisting of <NAME> as Chairman and other experts to review the progress of the automobile industry and to We may next refer to the principles and methods of costing which were followed by the <ORG> In case of an automobile a large number of components which undergo different manufacturing processes have also to be taken into account It was considered necessary to determine the price in September because the impugned order was promulgated at that time This meant that not only the prices in September were kept in view but also the value of pending stocks of raw materials and the average of the price at which purchases had been effected at that time were taken into account The following principal factors were considered relevant for the fixing of a fair selling price capacity of production There is also a general impression that it is the car manu facturers that are responsible for the seemingly exorbitant prices of the cars It will not be out of place to notice a few observations of expert bodies about taxation which as noticed above forms at least one third part of the price of a car The car is no longer an item of luxury and under the existing conditions it is fast becoming an item of necessity <NAME> That being so there is a case for giving some relief out of the excise duties and other levies which are by their nature multi point taxes causing hardship Cost and expenses on account of warranty and statutory bonus have been wrongly excluded from the ex works cost Depreciation of plant and machinery has been allowed on the basis of original cost whereas it should have been allowed on the replacement value or on the peculiar facts of the case On behalf of the petitioners it has been urged that according to various experts on costing including the Costing team appointed by the <ORG> the expenses which are to be incurred on account of the warranty should appropriately be included in the ex works cost If it is to be included in the ex works cost it means virtually passing it on to the consumer or per car has been taken into account in the return but the labour charges which would amount to Rs We shall next deal with the question of bonus payable to the employees which has been included in the return by the <ORG> The case of the manufacturers is that bonus is an expense which is necessarily incurred in the manufacture and it should be treated as part of the ex works cost Even if the entire amount of bonus is not allowed as part of the cost the manufacturers claim that the minimum bonus which at present is compulsorily payable at the rate of under of the Payment of Bonus Act should be allowed as a part of the cost because the manufacturers have to pay the same even when they do not make any profits The Tariff <ORG> in its recent report on the Price Structure of Man Made Fibre and Yarn Industry has accepted the view that entire bonus upto the limits prescribed should form part of the ex works cost salary or the wage earned by the employee during the accounting year or forty rupees whichever is higher whether there are profits in the accounting year or not Under where allocable surplus exceeds the minimum amount payable under it is payable in proportion to the salary or wage earned by the employee during the accounting year the maximum limit being Where there is no available surplus in an accounting year or the allocable surplus falls short of the minimum bonus payable and there is no sufficient amount carried forward and set on from which minimum bonus can be paid the same shall be carried forward for being set off in the succeeding year according to the fourth schedule Section of the Bonus Act at first sight may appear to be a provision for granting additional wage to employees but that section is an integral part of a scheme for payment of bonus at rates which do not widely fluctuate from year to year It has been ensured that the excess share shall be carried forward to the next year and that the amount paid by way of minimum bonus not absorbed by the available profits shall be carried to the next year and shall be set off against the profits of the succeeding year Such a method has never been adopted and there is absolutely no justification for making a discrimination between the methods to be adopted for ascertaining the ex works cost in September and in July It has been pointed out by Mr <NAME> that the prices of direct materials alone rose by Rs A comparison of the prices fixed for September and July further reveal how steeply the prices rose during the short period of nine months According to Mr <NAME> price fixation of the cars will be wholly futile unless there is a provision for escalation which means that the prices should be increased or decreased periodically according to the rise or decrease in the cost as also the various other factors which enter into price fixation There are a number of increases according to the manufacturer over which they have absolutely no control Indeed it has not been disputed on behalf of the Government and the Attorney General quite properly and fairly accepts that some proper method should be devised for escalation or de escalation as the case may be We have been suggested a number of formulae on behalf of the manufacturers as also the government but we shall indicate at a later stage what in our opinion is the best and the simplest method of providing for escalation and de escalation Owing to the inadequate price fixed by the government even under the informal price control the company has been running into losses Unless reserves are created and the financial position of the company improves it may not be possible for it to get any further loans because up till now it has been carrying on its business mainly on the borrowings The return leaves no margin for wiping out the depreciation which comes to Rs The <ORG> has not taken into consideration any provision for a cushion for the proposed increase in the rate of minimum bonus for which a persistent dialogue is going on all the time between the trade unions and the government If however the capacity is reduced to cars and trucks as claimed by the company the dividend payable to the equity shareholder will be at the rate of but then there will be no provision for development and future expansion or for wiping off the arrears of depreciation which amount to Rs Our attention has been drawn to reports of various <ORG>s according to which there were defects in production and there was neglect of economy and efficiency We have given our careful thought to the principles which the <ORG> has followed in fixing the return and in our judgment the return granted is a reasonable one keeping in view the entire circums tances Since the provision of depreciation is intended to enable replacement of the worn out assets it is argued on behalf of the car manufacturers that the <ORG> ought to have allowed depreciation at the rate which would have enabled the replacement of the assets In Price Fixation in Indian Industry to which reference has already been made at an earlier stage it has been mentioned that special depreciation was allowed in addition to the normal depreciation in case of pig iron steel cement and rubber tyre and tubes by the Tariff <ORG> see pages and It was pointed out that there are practical difficulties in adopting the principle of replacement cost The whole question according to the <ORG> has to be determined with reference to the context or the purpose for which the deprecation is being computed The depreciation which is allowed under the tax laws is very liberal and we see no reason to pass on the burden to the present consumer who is not likely to get any benefit out of the replacement proposed to be provided for by the manufacturers We shall now proceed to consider the question of the capacity of production On behalf of the car manufacturers it has been maintained that for the purpose of fixing the fair price under of the Act the actual figures of production should alone be taken into consideration and the optimum capacity for production must be disregarded as an irrelevant factor On the other hand it has been maintained on behalf of the government that it is always essential in the matter of fixation of fair price to determine the capacity of production which must mean at least achievable capacity even if not the maximum capacity Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to cause investigation to be made into the scheduled industries automobile industry being one of them Clause a i of provides for full investigation to be made where <ORG> is of the opinion that there has been or is likely to be a substantial fall in the volume of production for which having regard to the economic conditions prevailing there is no justification Section confers power in the matter of control supply distribution fair price etc There are numerous Acts which were enacted for the purpose of fixation of prices Supply and Prices of Goods Act Tariff <ORG> Act and the Act Those sections deal with specific matters on which the government can cause investigation to be made for the purpose of issuing appropriate directions including control of prices and those two sections are meant primarily for development and regulation of an industry There is a good deal of force in what the Attorney General says There is a good deal of force in the suggestion of Mr <NAME> that when such applications are made the applicant is prone to give higher figures in order to obtain the maximum permissible quantity of the material sought to be imported The firm principle which we have all along followed is that the report of an expert body like the <ORG> should be accepted except where it has been shown to have demonstrably fallen in err or on a question of principle or has completely ignored vital and material facts which if taken into consideration would have led to a different conclusion The case of <ORG> stands on a different footing because it had taken certain undertakings from the dealers and the customers with regard to the payment of the difference in price which will be determined after the judgment of this <ORG> and the one fixed in the order As regards <ORG> it has been submitted by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for that company that upto the beginning of it was manufacturing a two door saloon It suffered losses from onwards and no dividend was paid even to the preference shareholders Before the <ORG> it had been contended on behalf of the Government that the capacity of the company on a five day working week should be taken at cars and trucks and if this capacity was converted to a six day working week the company capacity could be rounded off at the level of cars and trucks There was some scope for an increase which could be estimated at and after allowing a capital addition of lacs towards tooling it was reasonable to assume that the company could easily reach the level of production of cars and commercial vehicles per annum There is an obvious error in the working out of the figures by the <ORG> It has been brought to our notice by Mr <NAME> that since then <ORG> have given their approval to renew the collaboration agreement on the basis of Royalty at pound per car i Rs This is correct and the amount on account of royalty must be included in the ex works cost for July As regards <ORG> it was stated on its behalf before the <ORG> that the present installed capacity was for cars and commercial vehicles per year In respect of cars however it was stated that due to rapid indigenisation undertaken by the company its original installed capacity had become imbalanced and at present it could not manufacture more than cars per annum From the information given to these experts the manufacturing capacity came to cars per year The <ORG> felt it was safer to rely on the manufacturer own statement made from time to time It is submitted by Mr <NAME> that although the <ORG> took into consideration the information and data supplied by the <ORG> contained in what is called the Brown Folder but the <ORG> failed to ask the <ORG> to produce the report made by those experts We see no reason or justification for rejecting the opinion of the experts namely <NAME> and <NAME> and the technical team especially when no member of that team was examined as a witness for finding out those facts and data which the <ORG> has sought to use for rejecting the technical team report There is no difficulty therefore in arriving at the figure of production of cars namely cars but the departure which the <ORG> made in the matter of production of trucks has been seriously disputed on behalf of the <ORG> There are a few minor matters which Mr <NAME> has argued relating to <ORG> According to Mr <NAME> this finding of the <ORG> is based on no evidence and has been arrived at in disregard of material evidence placed by the company before the <ORG> It is pointed out that <NAME> had stated in his deposition that the figure of tons might include locally purchased imported steel and this had to be checked up The <ORG> felt that the workshops of the dealers of <ORG> cars namely one in South <ORG> one in Bombay <ORG> and another in Delhi <ORG> had well equipped workshops with requisite type of plant and machinery but there was nothing to indicate that they were suffering any loss We are however unable to take these figures into account because from the data supplied to the <ORG> and the evidence that was produced before it there is nothing to indicate that the dealers are suffering any loss and are not making a reasonable margin of profit In other words the actual cost and not the historical cost should have been taken into account Depreciation on account of plant and machinery has been allowed on correct basis but for the purpose of allocation the capacities indicated above will be taken into account As regards the individual points raised on behalf of <ORG> <ORG> and the dealers our decision is as follows i The amount payable on account of royalty per car in the case of <ORG> pursuant to the collaboration agreement the renewal of which has been approved by <ORG> will be included in the ex works cost for July The government shall decide about the matter promptly by the first of January and first of July respectively and allow the increases if found to be genuine and correct provided the total amount of such increases exceeds Rs As regards the outgoings from the return which will be con fined to the minimum bonus payable under the Bonus Act interest on borrowings and income tax if there is a significant increase in these items the car manufacturers can submit their case with all the relevant data as well as proof to the government for claiming a corresponding increase in the return The government will also be entitled to take into account any decreases which take place either in the items which make up the ex works cost or the aforesaid outgoings from the return and the prices can be refixed accordingly The goverment will take the cost as in July as the base and will take into account all increases and decreases since July upto the date of the judgment in the ex works cost and the three outgoings from the return mentioned above As regards the other two manufacturing companies I need not dilate upon the question of admissions because there was sufficient other material which has been referred to in the main judgment in support of our conclusion regarding production capacity The <ORG> took into account various factors like manufacturing capacity quality norms of rejection bonus warranty interest and return and expressed its view with regard to each of them The term cost is ambiguous since it has several different meanings It is also manifest that the capacity which has to be taken into account is the achievable capacity of a plant run in a reasonably efficient manner It was also maintained on behalf of the petitioner company that it was not possible to increase the capacity for the manufacture of Standard <ORG> as <ORG> was a limiting factor The <ORG> also expressed the view that in the factory of the petitioner company there was scope for increasing productivity to the extent of It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner that the Com mission should have accepted the report of its Technical Team and not excluded it from consideration In this respect I find that according to the report of <ORG> it felt handicapped because it found at the time of its visit that the production in the petitioner company had virtually come to a standstill on account of the complete closure of the factory and the discharge of the factory employees <NAME> It would follow from the above that neither any physical verification could be made by <ORG> nor could it make a systematic study and it had to content itself with the material supplied by the petitioner company In the circumstances there was nothing wrong in the approach of the Commission which included a chartered accountant and an automobile engineer in relying upon its own assessment rather than that of <ORG> The other assessment of the manufacturing capacity of the petitioner company upon which reliance has been placed on its behalf is that made by <ORG> The above Committee presided over by <NAME> Ex Chief Secretary of <ORG> was appointed by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Industries Development and Regulation Act The material part of the order regarding the appointment of that Committee reads as under And whereas it has come to the notice of <ORG> that the volume of production of the articles manufactured in the said industrial undertaking had been gradually going down and the production has now come to a standstill consequent upon the closure of the said industrial undertaking by the management And whereas <ORG> is of opinion that it is expedient to take urgent measures to remedy the situation arising out of the closure of the said industrial undertaking and to ensure that production in the said scheduled industry does not suffer to the detriment of the public interest Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Industries Development and Regulation Act <ORG> hereby appoints for the purpose of making a full and complete investigation into the circumstances of the case a body of persons It would thus appear that though <ORG> was asked to inquire into the gradual fall in production in the petitioner factory and its ultimate closure and to suggest remedial measures in that connection the said <ORG> was not called upon to determine the achievable capacity of the factory of the petitioner company There is nothing to indicate that any attempt was made before the <ORG> to show that the achievable capacity of the petitioner company was more than what was stated on behalf of the petitioner There are a number of communications and applications addressed by the petitioner company which also go to show that the estimate formed by the <ORG> regarding the production capacity of the petitioner company did not lean on the side of being excessive It is well known that admissions constitute a strong piece of evidence against the party making the admissions and it is for that party to show that the admissions are mistaken or are not true
