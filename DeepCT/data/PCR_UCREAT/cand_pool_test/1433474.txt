In the declarations filed by them under Tariff Item they claimed exemption for the years After usual investigation show cause notices as set out above were issued alleging that the appellants had not filed classification list price list and list of products manufactured by them nor determined nor paid the <ORG> duty on the goods cleared cleared the goods without cover of valid documents licence and failed to make statutory records and documents and had thus committed breach of Rule read with Rule read with Rule A read with Rule and of the <ORG> Rules The appellants filed replies dated and to the show cause notices The appellants therefore submitted that there was no legal and statutory obligation upon the appellants to follow any <ORG> procedure and make any declaration It was also submitted that prior to introduction of Notification No dated the appellants were holding <ORG> licence but on account of exemption from payment of <ORG> duty and <ORG> licence control under the two Notifications No and No the appellants surrendered their licence and the same were cancelled by the <ORG> Department It was also urged that the claim was time barred as there were <ORG> decisions in favour of the appellants stand and in such a case demand could not be for more than months He also imposed a penalty of Rs Aggrieved with these orders the appellants have filed appeals before the <ORG> which have been heard together He however in fairness drew attention of the Bench to Delhi High Court decision in <ORG> case supra where contrary view is taken Besides <ORG> decision he also relied on the following four decisions <NAME> learned Departmental Representative representing the respondents controverting <NAME> arguments submitted that fully unconditionally exempted goods do not cease to be excisable goods and the value of their clearance would have to be included for the purpose of determining aggregate value of clearance under the two notifications We have carefully considered these submissions made by both the parties Taking up first the question whether the goods in question having been fully and unconditionally exempted under Notification No dated as amended and the argument that on this being done goods ceased to be excisable goods the question need not detain us long We have already referred to divergent decisions on the point to which Sh After referring to Rule of Central Excise Rules <ORG> further held as under The submissions made on behalf of the petitioner that the moment a manufacturer is allowed exemption in respect of any goods by virtue of a notification it ceases to be excisable goods The contention advanced on behalf of the respondents that the words as being subject to a duty of excise in Section is only descriptive of the goods and not to the actual levy is the correct approach to the question For this argument he placed reliance on certain observations of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> ELT We do not accept <NAME> argument on the point In view of this decision the fact that the appellants manufacture of goods was exempt from excise control or from licensing would make no difference to the question of goods being excisable or their inclusion in the value of clearance unless as already said the notification itself make such exclusion permissible We cannot agree with <NAME> submissions of the point As or <NAME> argument about penalty that in view of divergent view of <ORG> as to unconditionally exempted goods being excisable for non excisable and such value being includible or otherwise in he value of clearance we do see considerable force in the argument The appellants became ineligible for exemption only when value of clearance of goods falling under Tariff Item unconditionally exempted under Notification No dated is included in determining the value of aggregate clearances About such includibility as already said there are divergent <ORG> decisions We therefore set aside the penalty imposed against the appellants in all the cases Except as to relief of setting aside penalties we dismiss these appeals
