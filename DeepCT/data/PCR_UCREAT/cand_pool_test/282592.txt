officiate in a senior post At the time his appointment to the service there were no vacancies in the senior posts Vacancies arose before he was appointed to officiate in the senior post and after Vacancies were also filled in by promotion under the Special Recruitment Regulations the petitioner contended that i he had a right to hold a post in the senior scale of pay from April ii under the rules seventy five per cent of the total number of senior posts was exclusively reserved for direct recruits and that in computing the twenty five per cent quota officers in Lists and III and special recruits had to be included iii of the Recruitment Rules which authorised <ORG> to make regulation for special recruitment was bad on the ground of excessive deletation iv of the Regulation of Seniority Rules made unjust discrimination between a promotee and a direct recruit in the matter of seniority by arbitrarily allotting a lower year of allotment to a promotee and therefore violated Arts i The filling of a vacancy by a non <ORG> officer under of the <ORG> Rules does not infringe any right of the <ORG> officer nor does it amount to withholding of Promotion or a Penalty within the meaning of of All India Service Discipline and Appeal Rules He was appointed to officiate in a senior post on November The posts held by officers in Lists and III were excluded from the cadre for the period during which they were held by those officers On April there was thus no available vacancy for the petitioner in the senior posts If a person other than a cadre officer is appointed to a cadre post for a period exceeding three months the fact shall be reported to <ORG> who may on receipt of the report direct <ORG> to terminate his appointment and if he is likely to fill a cadre post for a period exceeding six months <ORG> must seek the advice of <ORG> and in the light of its advice give suitable directions to <ORG> Sub rule of as amended provides that Recruitment to the Service after

opinion of <ORG> the exigencies of the service so require <ORG> may after consultation with the <ORG> Governments and the <ORG> adopt such methods of recruitment to the Service other than those specified in the said sub rules as it may by regulations made in this behalf prescribe Rule deals with recruitment by selection in special cases from amongst persons who hold in a substantive capacity

percentage specified in sub rule the following category of officers shall be excluded namely i officers of a <ORG> Civil Service appointed to the Service under the Emergency Recruitment Scheme otherwise than against the per cent quota iii officers of a <ORG> Civil Service appointed to the Service from List II prepared by <ORG> under the Indian Administrative Service Extension to <ORG>s Schemes iv officers of a <ORG> Civil Service appointed to the Service under the Indian Administrative Service Special Recruitment Regulations Rule of I A Regulation of Seniority Rules provides that every officer shall be assigned a year of allotment Rule a provides inter alia that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these rules shall be where the officer is appointed to the Service on the results of a competitive examination the year following the year in which such examination was held Rule provides that the year of allotment of an officer shall be where the officer is appointed to the Service by promotion in accordance with subrule of rule of the Recruitment Rules the year of allotment of the junior most among the officers recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those rules who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the former The proviso to lays down that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service in accordance with sub rule of rule of the Recruitment Rules who started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officer recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those Rules so started officiating shall be determined ad hoc by <ORG> in consultation with the State Government concerned He was not given any opportunity of showing cause against the action taken against him He filed a writ petition in <ORG> asking for the issue of a writ quashing the order of reversion On appeal this Court set aside the order of <ORG> and allowed the petition <NAME> said that the whole scheme of the rules indicates that a person borne on the junior scale of pay has a right to hold a post on the senior scale of pay depending upon the availability of a post and his seniority in the junior scale of pay For he has not only been reduced in rank but his promotion to the senior scale has also been withheld In this background the petitioner says that he was deprived of his right to hold a senior post during the period from April up to November We have found already that on April there was no available vacancy in the senior post to which he should be appointed The petitioner contends that he had the absolute right to be appointed to a vacancy in the senior posts on and after April the filling of the vacancies by non cadre officers on the ground that he was not suitable was an infringement of his right and amounted to withholding of promotion and a penalty within the meaning of of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules per cent of the total number of senior posts was reserved exclusively for direct recruits and in computing the per cent quota under of the Recruitment Rules officers in Lists and III and special recruits should be included This right is infringed if the junior cadre officer is promoted to fill a vacancy in the senior scale while he continues to hold a post in the junior scale of pay But he cannot claim the right to fill the vacancy if he is not suitable and no cadre officer junior to him is promoted to fill the vacancy An officer in the junior scale of pay has no right to a senior post as soon as he joins the Service He may be appointed to a senior post only when he is found suitable having regard to his length of service experience and performance in the junior scale of pay Under of the Cadre Rules a senior cadre post may be filled by a non cadre officer if there is no suitable officer available for filling the vacancy As against cadre officers junior to him he had the right to hold the post in the senior scale of pay The petitioner was not reduced in rank nor was his promotion withheld He had no right to fill a vacancy in the senior posts or to draw salary in the senior scale between April and November There is no merit in the contention that per cent of the total number of senior posts is reserved exclusively for direct recruits Under of the Recruitment Rules the number of persons recruited to senior posts under of the Recruitment Rules by promotion or by selection cannot exceed per cent of the total number of senior posts Paragraph iv of the I A Extension to States Scheme provided that the posts held by officers included in Lists and III would be excluded from the cadre for the period they were held by those officers and would revert to the cadre as and when they ceased to be required for that purpose The posts held by the officers in List III were excluded from the cadre until they retired and were not counted against the per cent quota The posts held by the officers in List pending absorption in the service were excluded from the cadre There were vacancies in the per cent quota which were filled up by promotion of respondents Nos and from <ORG> No appointments were made between November and November when the petitioner was appointed to officiate in a senior post Other respondents were appointed after November He has not given any adequate explanation as to the delay in filing the writ petition The petitioner challenges the vires of of the Recruitment Rules under which <ORG> framed the Special Recruitment Regulations From the point of view of the promotee his seniority should be counted from the date of his joining <ORG> From the point of view of the direct recruit the seniority of the promotee should be counted from the date of his appointment to <ORG> It gives the promotee the year of allotment of the junior most direct recruit officiating continuously in a senior post earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the promotee The petitioner next challenges the validity of Regulation of the Special Recruitment Seniority Regulations on the ground that it offends Arts There is no substance in this contention
