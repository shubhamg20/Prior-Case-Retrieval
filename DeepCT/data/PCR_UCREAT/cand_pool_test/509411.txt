I have satisfied myself that no injustice is caused by dismissing this appeal for non prosecution as it is on the concurrent findings of the Courts below and no substantial question of law arises for consideration Though in the memorandum of facts in support of I A II it is stated that the Counsel appearing for the appellant was seriously ill and unable to move out of the house due to acute diabetic nuerosis and because of his physical inability he could not go to the <ORG> and represent the matter The point now for consideration is whether this application under Order Rule is maintainable as this <ORG> in the absence of the Counsel appearing for the appellant proceeded to observe that no substantial question of law arises for consideration which ultimately may mean that the appeal was not found fit for admission on merits Under Sub rule of Rule where on the date fixed or on any other date to which hearing may be adjourned the appellant does not appear when the appeal is called for hearing the <ORG> may make an Order that appeal be dismissed Thus this is the stage when the appeal is posted for hearing after it is admitted to hear on the substantial questions of law arising in the appeal Rule makes reference to Sub rule of Rule which states that if on the day or any other date to which the hearing may be adjourned the appellant does not appear when the appeal is called on for hearing the <ORG> may make an order that the appeal be dismissed It says that at the time of making an order under Rule of Order for the hearing of the second appeal the <ORG> shall formulate the substantial question of law as required by Section and in doing so the <ORG> may direct that the second appeal be heard on the question so formulated and it shall not be open to the appellant to urge any other ground in the appeal without the leave of the <ORG> given in accordance with the provisions of Section Referring to this definition it was urged that the <ORG> has power to peruse the papers as a preliminary step or give a preliminary hearing to decide to issue notice to respondent or direct issue of notice to respondent Broadly speaking it is apparently clear from reading of Rule of Order or Order Rule that the appellant Counsel or appellant must be heard before the <ORG> decides whether there is substantial question of law involved or not in the appeal Judgments of the trial <ORG> and the first Appellate <ORG> before deciding whether the appeal involves substantial questions of law or not as the question of fact decided in the first Appellate <ORG> could not be reopened unless appreciation of evidence is perverse When the appeal reaches the High <ORG> it has to apply its mind while considering the appeal for admission and hearing the appellant Counsel who would assist the <ORG> in determining the questions involved in the appeal That being so it cannot be said that the order passed by this <ORG> in the absence of the appellant should be construed as an order passed on hearing the appellant and on merits When this Court finds that even at the admission stage an appeal could not be dismissed on merits the Court has broad discretion of rectifying its own order as <ORG> of the State to impart justice and to prevent failure of justice that may occasion if its order were to stand In my view therefore the order now in question cannot be deemed to have been passed on merits as the same was passed without hearing the appellant Counsel and considering the grounds made out in the memorandum of facts that the Counsel was seriously ill and was not in a position to attend the Court on the date fixed for admission as constituting sufficient cause for the Advocate not being present the order in question dated is set aside holding the same to be an order passed for default of the appellant Counsel and the Appeal is restored to file The same shall be posted for admission
