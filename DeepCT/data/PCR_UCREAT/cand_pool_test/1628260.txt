apprehend petitioner son if the defence of his escape from police custody be true There was hand cuff on the hands of the deceased when his body was found on the railway track with rope around it A Award of compensation in a proceeding under Article by this <ORG> or by the High <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort Enforcement of the constitutional right and grant of redress embraces award of compensation as part of the legal consequences of its contravention A claim in public law for compensation for contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms the protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution is an acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection of such rights and such a claim based on strict liability made by resorting to a constitutional remedy provided for the enforcement of a fundamental right is distinct from and in addition to the remedy in private law for damages for the tort resulting from the contravention of the fundamental right It is this principle which justifies award of monetary compensation for contravention of fundamental rights guaran teed by the Constitution when that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention made by the <ORG> or its servants in the purported exercise of their powers and enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by resort to the remedy in public law under the Constitution by recourse to Articles and of the Constitution The <ORG> is not helpless and the wide powers given to this <ORG> by Article which itself is a fundamental right imposes a constitutional obligation on this <ORG> to forge such new tools which may be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution which enable the award of monetary compensation In appropriate cases where that is the only mode of redress available The deceased was aged about years and had a monthly income between Rs to Rs A total amount of Rs would be appropriate as compensation to be awarded to the petitioner in the present case The respondent <ORG> of Orissa is directed to pay the sum of Rs lo the petitioner as compensation and a further sum of Rs as costs to be paid to the <ORG> Legal Aid Committee Per Dr A Anand Concurring Convicts prisoners or under trials are not denuded of their fundamental rights under Article and It is only such restrictions as are permitted by law which can be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights by such persons It is an obligation of the <ORG> to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasable rights of a citizen to life except in accordance with law while the citizen is in its custody The precious right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution of India cannot be denied to convicts under trials or other prisoners in custody except according to procedure established by law His liberty is in the very nature of things circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement and therefore his interest in the limited liberty left to him is rather precious The wrongdoer is accountable and the <ORG> is responsible if the person in custody of the police is deprived of his life except according to the procedure established by law A The public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings The purpose of public law is not only to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights Therefore which the court moulds the relief by granting compensation in proceedings under Article or of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights it does so under the public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the <ORG> which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen The payment of compensation in such cases is not to be understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an order of making monetary amends under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of public duty of not protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen The compensation is in the nature of the exemplary damages awarded against the wrong doer for the breach of its public law duty and is independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under the private law in an action based on tort through a suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or and prosecute the offender under the penal law This <ORG> and the High <ORG>s being the protectors of the civil liberties of the citizen have not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to grant relief in exercise of its jurisdiction under Articles and of the Constitution to the victim or the heir of the victim whose fundamental rights under Article of the Constitution of India are established to have been flagrantly infringed by calling upon the <ORG> to repair the damage done by its officers to the fundamental rights of the citizen notwithstanding the right of the citizen to the remedy by way of a civil suit or criminal proceedings The <ORG> of course has the right to be indemnified by and take such action as may be available to it against the wrongdoer in accordance with law through appropriate proceeding Of course relief in exercise of the power under Article or would be granted only once it is established that there has been an infringement of the fundamental rights of the citizen and no other form of appropriate redressal by the court in the facts and circumstances of the case is possible A Law is in the process of development and the process necessitates developing separate public law procedures as also public law principles It may be necessary to identify the situations to which separate proceedings and principles apply and the courts have to act firmly but with certain amount of circumspection and self restraint lest proceedings under Article or are misused as a disguised substitute for civil action in private law The Judgments of the Court were delivered by <NAME> A letter dated sent to this Court by Smt At about the next day on the petitioner came to know that the dead body of her son <NAME> was found on the railway track near a bridge at some distance from the Jaraikela railway station There were multiple injuries on the body of <NAME> when it was found and obviously his death was unnatural caused by those injuries The defence of the respondents is that <NAME> managed to escape from police custody at about a on the night between the st and nd December from the Police Outpost Jeraikela where he was detained and guarded by Police Constable <NAME> he could not be apprehended thereafter in spite of a search and the dead body of <NAME> was found on the railway track the next day with multiple injuries which indicated that he was run over by a passing train after he had escaped from police custody In view of the controversy relating to the cause of death of <NAME> a direction was given by this Court on to the District Judge <NAME> in Orissa to hold an inquiry into the matter and submit a report Accordingly evidence was led by the parties and the District Judge has submitted the Inquiry Report dated containing his finding based on that evidence that <NAME> had died on account of multiple injuries inflicted to him while he was in police custody at the Police Outpost Jeraikela The correctness of this finding and Report of the District Judge being disputed by the respondents the matter was examined afresh by us in the light of the objections raised to the Inquiry Report The burden is therefore clearly on the respondents to explain how <NAME> sustained those injuries which caused his death To avoid this obvious and logical inference of custodial death the learned Additional Solicitor General relied on the respondent defence that <NAME> had managed to escape from police custody at about a on the night between the st and nd December and it was likely that he was run over by a passing train when he sustained the fatal injuries The evidence adduced by the respondents is relied on by the learned Additional Solicitor General to support this defence and to contend that the responsibility of the respondents for the safety of <NAME> came to an end the moment <NAME> escaped from police custody <NAME> who appeared as amicus curiae for the petitioner however contended that the evidence adduced during the inquiry does not support the defence of respondents and there is no reason to reject the finding of the learned District Judge that <NAME> died in police custody as a result of injuries inflicted to him Sub Inspector of Police during investigation of an offence of theft in the village and was detained at Police Outpost Jeraikela <NAME> and <NAME> another accused were handcuffed tied together and kept in custody at the police station <NAME> mother the petitioner and grand mother went to the Police Outpost at about with food for <NAME> which he ate and thereafter these women came away while <NAME> continued to remain in police custody Police Constable <NAME> and some other persons were present at the Police Outpost that night and the dead body of <NAME> with a handcuff and multiple injuries was found lying on the railway track at Kilometer No between Jeraikela and Bhalulata railway stations on the morning of It is significant that there is no cogent independent evidence of any search made by the police to apprehend <NAME> if the defence of his escape from police custody be true Before discussing the other evidence adduced by the parties during the inquiry reference may be made to the injuries found on the dead body of <NAME> during postmortem The learned Additional Solicitor General placed strong reliance ore the written opinion of Dr <NAME> Professor Head of <ORG> <ORG> Cuttack given on on a reference made to him wherein he stated on the basis of the documents that the injuries found on the dead body of <NAME> could have been caused by rolling on the railway track in between the rail and by coming into forceful contact with projecting part of the moving train engine While adding that it did not appear to be a case of suicide he indicated that there was more likelihood of accidental fall on the railway track followed by the running engine train The opinion of Dr <NAME> is cryptic based on conjectures for which there is no basis and says nothing about the injuries being both anti mortem and post mortem We have no hesitation in reaching this conclusion and preferring the testimony of the doctor who conducted the postmortem There was hand cuff on the hands of the deceased when his body was found on the railway track with rope around it It is no necessary for us to refer to the other evidence including the oral evidence adduced during the inquiry from which the learned District Judge reached the conclusion that it is a case of custodial death and <NAME> died as a result of the injuries inflicted to him voluntarily while he was in police custody at the Police Outpost Jeraikela We have reached the same conclusion on a reappraisal of the evidence adduced at the inquiry taking into account the circumstances which also support that conclusion This was done in view of the vehemence with which the learned Additional Solicitor General urged that it is not a case of custodial death but of death of <NAME> caused by injuries sustained by him in a train accident after he had managed to escape from police custody by chewing off the rope with which he had been tied for being detained at the Police Outpost It may be mentioned straightaway that award of compensation in a proceeding under Article by this court or by <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort We shall now refer to the earlier decisions of this <ORG> as well as some other decisions before further discussion of this principle <NAME> dealing with this aspect stated as under It is true that Article cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and obligations which can be enforced effecaciously through the ordinary processes of Courts Civil and Criminal A money claim has therefore to be agitated in and adjudicated upon in a suit instituted in a court of lowest grade competent to try it But the important question for our consideration is whether in the exercise of its jurisdiction under article this Court can pass an order for the payment of money if such an order is in the nature of compensation consequential upon the deprivation of a fundamental right But we have no doubt that if the petitioner files a suit to recover damages for his illegal detention a decree for damages would have to be passed in that suit though it is not possible to predicate in the absence of evidence the precise amount which would be decreed in his favour Article which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court were limited to passing orders to release from illegal detention One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article secured is to mulct its violaters in the payment of monetary compensation Administrative sclerosis lead ing to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the state as shield If Civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well known to suffer mention it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that respect for the rights of in dividuals is the true bastion of democracy Therefore the State must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner rights It may have recourse against those officers pp emphasis supplied It does appear from the above extract that even though it was held that compensation could be awarded under Article for contravention of a fundamental right yet it was also stated that the petitioner could have been relegated to the ordinary remedy of a suit if his claim to compensation was factually controversial and Article cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary processes The later decisions of this Court proceed on the assumption that monetary compensation can be awarded for violation of constitutional rights under Article or Article of the Constitution but this aspect has not been adverted to In <NAME> the <ORG> was held liable to pay compensation payable to the mother of the deceased who died as a result of beating and assault by the police In <NAME> reference was made to the <ORG> liability for tortious acts of its servants without any reference being made to the decision of this Court in <NAME> The <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh wherein sovereign immunity was upheld in the case of vicarious liability of the <ORG> for the tort of its employees In this context it is sufficient to say that the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> upholding the State plea of sovereign immunity for tortious acts of its servants is confined to the sphere of liability in tort which is distinct from the State liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the doctrine of sovereign immunity has no application in the constitutional scheme and is no defence to the constitutional remedy under Articles and of the Constitution which enables award of compensation for contravention of fundamental rights when the only practicable mode of enforcement of the fundamental rights can be the award of compensation On the other hand <ORG> related to value of goods seized and not returned to he owner due to the fault of Government servants the claim being of damages for the tort of conversion under the ordinary process and not a claim for compensation for violation of fundamental rights It was argued on behalf of the Attorney General that does not permit of an order for monetary compensation despite the fact that this kind of redress was ordered in <NAME> Attorney General of Guyana SC The jurisdiction to make such an order is conferred on <ORG> by para a of viz jurisdiction to hear and determine any application made by any person in pursuance of sub section of this section The very wide powers to make orders issue writs and give directions are to this Thus on this principle the view was unanimous that enforcement of the constitutional right and grant of redress embraces award of compensation as part of the legal consequences of its contravention It follows that a claim in public law for compensation for contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms the protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution is an acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection of such rights and such a claim based on strict liability made by resorting to a constitutional remedy provided for the enforcement of a fundamental right is distinct from and in addition to the remedy in private law for damages for the tort resulting from the contravention of the fundamental right It is this principle which justifies award of monetary compensation for contravention of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution when that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention made by the <ORG> or its servants in the purported exercise of their powers and enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by resort to the remedy in public law under the Constitution by recourse to Articles and of the Constitution A useful discussion on this topic which brings out the distinction between the remedy in public law based on strict liability for violation of a fundamental right enabling award of compensation to which the defence of sovereign immunity is inapplicable and the private law remedy wherein vicarious liability of the <ORG> in tort may arise is to be found in <NAME> <NAME> Law of Torts nd Edition by Justice <NAME> at pages to This view finds support from the decisions of this Court in the Bhagalpur blinding cases Kharti and Others II <ORG> of Bihar and Others and <ORG>TV <ORG> of Bihar and Others wherein it was said that the court is not helpless to grant relief in a case of violation of the right to life and personal liberty and it should be prepared to forge new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating these precious fundamental rights the court is not helpless and the wide powers given to this <ORG> by Article which itself is a fundamental right imposes a constitutional obligation on this <ORG> to forge such new tools which may be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution which enable the award of monetary compensation in appropriate cases where that is the only mode of redress available We have considered this question at some length in view of the doubt raised at times about the propriety of awarding compensation in such proceedings instead of directing the claimant to resort to the ordinary process of recovery of damages by recourse to an action in tort The deceased <NAME> was aged about years and had a monthly income between Rs to Rs This is the finding based on evidence recorded by the District Judge and there is no reason to doubt its correctness In our opinion a total amount of Rs would be appropriate as compensation to be awarded to the petitioner in the present case I would however like to record a few observations of my own while concurring with his Lordship judgment It was urged on behalf of the <ORG> that the medical evidence did establish that the injuries had been caused to the deceased by lathi blows but it was asserted that the nature of injuries on the face and left temporal region could not have been caused by the lathis and therefore the death had occurred in the manner suggested by the police in a train accident and that it was not caused by the police while the deceased was in their custody This aspect of the medical evidence would go to show that after inflicting other injuries which resulted in the death of <NAME> the police with a view to cover up their crime threw the body on the rail track and the injuries on the face and left temporal region were received by the deceased after he had died This aspect further exposes not only the barbaric attitude of the police but also its crude attempt to fabricate false clues and create false evidence with a view to screen its offence The theory of escape has thus been rightly disbelieved and I agree with the view of Brother <NAME> that the death of <NAME> was caused while he was in custody of the police by police torture That is a matter which shall have to be decided by the competent court I respectfully agree with the directions given to the <ORG> by Brother <NAME> <NAME> in this behalf On basis of the above conclusion we have now to examine whether to seek the right of redressal under Article of the Constitution which is without prejudice to any other action with respect to the same matter which way be lawfully available extends merely to a declaration that there has been contravention and infringement of the guaranteed fundamental rights and rest content at that by relegating the party to seek relief through civil and criminal proceedings or can it go further and grant redress also by the only practicable form of redress by awarding monetary damages for the infraction of the right to life It is exiomatic that convicts prisoners or under trials are not denuded of their fundamental rights under Article and it is only such restrictions as are permitted by law which can be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental right by such persons It is an obligation of the <ORG> to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible rights of a citizen to life except in accordance with law while the citizen is in its custody The precious right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution of India cannot be denied to convicts under trials or other prisoners in custody except according to procedure established by law His liberty is in the very nature of things circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement and therefore his interest in the limited liberty left to him is rather precious The wrongdoer is accountable and the <ORG> is responsible if the person in custody of the police is deprived of his life except according to the procedure established by law I agree with Brother <NAME> <NAME> that the defence of sovereign immunity in such cases is not available to the <ORG> and in fairness to Mr <NAME> it may be recorded that he raised no such defence either The public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings The purpose of public law is not only to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights Therefore when the court molds the relief by granting compensation in proceedings under Article or of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights it does so under the public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the <ORG> which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen The payment of compensation in such cases is not to be understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an order of making monetary amends under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of public duty of not protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen The compensation is in the nature of exempellary damages awarded against the wrong doer for the breach of its public law duty and is independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under the private law in an action based on tort through a suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or and persecute the offender under the penal law This <ORG> and <ORG> being the protectors of the civil liberties of the citizen have not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to grant relief in exercise of its jurisdiction under Articles and of the Constitution to the victim or the heir of the victim whose fundamental rights under Article of the Constitution of India are established to have been flagrantly infringed by calling upon the <ORG> to repair the damage done by its officers The <ORG> of course has the right to be indemnified by and take such action as may be available to it against the wrongdoer in accordance with law through appropriate proceedings Of course relief in exercise of the power under Article or would be granted only once it is established that there has been an infringement of the fundamental rights of the citizen and no other form of appropriate redressal by the court in the facts and circumstances of the case is possible In doing so the courts take into account not only the interest of the applicant and the respondent but also the interests of the public as a whole with a view to ensure that public bodies or officials do not act unlawfully and do perform their public duties properly particularly where the fundamental rights of a citizen under Article is concerned Law is in the process of development and the process necessitates developing separate public law procedures as also public law principles It may be necessary to identify the situations to which separate proceedings and principles apply And the courts have to act firmly but with certain amount of circumspection and self restraint lest proceedings under Article or are misused as a disguised substitute for civil action in private law For the reasons recorded by Brother <NAME> I agree that the <ORG> of Orissa should pay a sum of Rs to the petitioner and a sum of Rs by way of costs to the Supreme <ORG> Legal Aid Committee Board I concur with the view expressed by Brother <NAME> and the directions given by him in the judgment in all respects
