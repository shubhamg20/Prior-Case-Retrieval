Respondents and who were members of the derecognised union instituted a suit in the <ORG> under I of the Code of Civil Procedure in a representative capacity alleging that the earlier settlement was a contract of service and that the new settlement would bring about a change in their service conditions that the new settlement was arrived at without following the mandatory requirements of A of the Act and have prayed for a permanent injunction to restrain the appellant from implementing the later settlement The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to try the suit as it was a suit of a civil nature for enforcement of rights of common and general law and consequently there was no question of reliefs being claimed under the Industrial Disputes Act On further appeal to this Court it was contended by the respondents that the remedy provided under the Industrial Disputes Act was a misnomer in that reference of an industrial dispute for adjudication to a tribunal would depend upon the exercise of the power by the <ORG> under of the Industrial Disputes Act The Act did not confer any right on the suitor Allowing the appeal HELD The suit for a decree for permanent injunction was not maintainable in the civil court as it had no jurisdiction to grant the relief or even a temporary relief Withdrawal of the claim based upon the said agreement from the trial court had no effect on the question of its jurisdiction to try the suit In so far as the suit was filed in a representative capacity on behalf of the members of the derecognised <ORG> by two of its members under I of the Code it was clearly a suit in relation to the exercise of right created under the Act Even accepting that in their case it had assumed the character of an implied term of contract of service the alternative claim made in paragraph of the plaint as being a condition of service otherwise can be referable to the claim of the non members only The numerous persons must have the same interest in one suit instituted under I of the Code Persons having different interests cannot be so represented But it is apparent that both the agreements could not be simultaneously given effect to The result of the order of injunction made by the trial court was that the workmen represented by the two plaintiffs were to get incentive payments in accordance with the scheme embodied in the earlier agreement ignoring the addition to the strength of the workmen On the other hand the members of the recognised union who had entered into the second agreement were to get their incentive payments in accordance with that agreement taking into account the contribution made in the matter of production by the newly added workmen Section providing an exception to this is not attracted in this case The jurisdiction of the civil court in India to grant a relief of injunction is limited to cases in which there is a right at law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> These two appeals filed by special leave of this Court have been heard together because an important question of law as to the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain the suits of the kinds filed in the two cases is common Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant company in Civil Appeal No of followed by Mr <NAME> appearing for respondents to and Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant company in Civil Appeal No of argued in support of the ouster of the jurisdiction of <ORG> Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the plaintiff respondents and vehemently combated the proposition We shall proceed to state the facts of Civil Appeal No of first discuss the point of jurisdiction as also the other points involved in that appeal and then briefly refer to the facts of the other case Beside the members of these two unions there are certain workmen who are members of neither It appears that at the time of the execution of the last agreement there were workmen in the department The two workmen who were the members of <ORG> rushed to the court and instituted their plaint on the th April in <ORG> at Bombay seeking the permission of the court to institute the suit in a representative capacity under order I Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure hereinafter called the Code representing the workmen who were members of <ORG> as also those who were neither its members nor members of <ORG> The first relief claimed in the suit was that the settlement dated the th January was not binding on the plaintiff and other concerned daily rated and monthly rated workmen of <ORG> who were not members of <ORG> <ORG> framed several issues for trial but curiously enough dropped many issues as not surviving in view of the stand taken on behalf of the plaintiffs counsel at the time of the trial of the suit It was conceded on their behalf and rightly too that the agreement dated the st December was a settlement under section of the Act But since the suit was filed on behalf of the non members also who were not members of either <ORG> and in a representative capacity the main basis of the suit being the agreement dated the st December was given up and it was stated on behalf of the plaintiffs that they did not wish to enforce that agreement But holding that the court had jurisdiction to try the suit as it was a suit of a Civil nature for enforcement of rights of common and general law and consequently there is no question of the reliefs being claimed under the Industrial Disputes Act it granted a sort of conditional decree of injuction restraining the appellant from enforcing or implementing the terms of agreement of the th January against the workmen of its <ORG> who are not members of the Association <ORG> The injunction however was not to operate in regard to any workmen who in writing accepted the terms of the impugned agreement or after the appellant took steps in accordance with law to make the agreement binding on workmen other than those who are not members of the Association <ORG> The decree for injunction was also to cease to be operative if the appellant gave any notice of change under section A of the Act on expiry of months after the expiry of days notice given under the said provisions of law The company filed an appeal in <ORG> to challenge the decision of <ORG> The learned single Judge of <ORG> who heard the appeal following his decision in <ORG> filed by the other company which is appellant in the other appeal sustained the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain the suit and did not feel persuaded to interfere with it on merits The foremost and perhaps the only point undoubtedly a vexed one which falls for our determination is whether on the facts and in the circumstances of this case <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain the suit filed by respondents and against the appellant and respondents to Various English and Indian authorities were cited on the point on either side at the <ORG> and we shall endeavour to answer the question of law on appreciation of many such authorities Before we do so we may very briefly refer to the relevant provisions of the Act The expression industrial dispute is defined in section to say that industrial dispute means any dispute or difference between employers and employers or between employers and workmen or between workmen and workmen which is connected with the employment or non employment or the terms of employment or with the conditions of labour of any person Section gives the definition of the word settlement thus settlement means a settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceeding and includes a written agreement between the employer and workmen arrived at otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceeding where such agreement has been signed by the parties thereto in such manner as may be prescribed and a copy thereof has been sent to an officer authorised in this behalf by the appropriate Government and the conciliation officer Chapter II provides for the authorities under the Act namely for constitution of <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and National <ORG> as also for appointment of <ORG> officers Different kinds of authorities having very varied and extensive powers in the matter of settlement and adjudication of industrial disputes have been constituted The labour Courts and the Tribunals to whom industrial disputes are referred by the appropriate governments under section can create new contracts lay down new industrial policy for industrial peace order reinstatement of dismissed workmen which ordinarily <ORG> could not do If there is a failure of conciliation the appropriate government is required to make a reference under section of the Act Section makes provision for terminating a settlement and provides that it shall continue to be binding until then Section provides for penalty for breach of settlement or award Section provides for recovery of money due from an employer If the dispute is not an industrial dispute within the meaning of section or within the meaning of section A of the Act it is obvious that there is no provision for adjudication of such disputes under the Act He has to choose the one or the other But we shall presently show that <ORG> will have no jurisdiction to try and adjudicate upon an industrial dispute if it concerned enforcement of certain right or liability created only under the Act In that event <ORG> will have no jurisdiction even to grant a decree of injunction to prevent the threatened injury on account of the alleged breach of contract is the contract if one which is recognized by and enforceable under the Act alone In Dos Bridges at page are the famous and oft quoted words of Lord <NAME> saying where an Act creates an obligation and enforces the performance in a specified manner we take it to a general rule that performance cannot be enforced in any other manner This passage was cited with approval by the Earl of Halsbury in Pasmore and others <ORG> and by Lord <NAME> at page in the case of <NAME> <ORG> classic enunciation of the law and classification of the cases in three classes was done by <NAME> with the precision which distinguished the utterances of that most accomplished lawyer in the case of <ORG> <NAME> vide the speech of Viscount <NAME> at page in the case of <NAME> <ORG> The classes are enumerated thus There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established by statute There is that class where there is a liability existing at common law and which is only re enacted by the statute with a special form of remedy there unless the statute contains words necessarily excluding the common law remedy the plaintiff has his election of proceeding either under the statute or at common law Then there is a second class which consists of those cases in which a statute has created a liability but has given no special remedy for it there the party may adopt an action of debt or other remedy at common law to enforce it The third class is where the statute creates a liability not existing at common law and gives also a particular remedy for enforcing it There was no such liability before it Earl of Halsbury pointed out in his speech at page The principle that where a specific remedy is given by a statute it thereby deprives the person who insists upon a remedy of any other form of remedy than that given by the statute is one which is very familiar and which runs through the law Supposing after providing for awarding of certain compensation in Chapter VA of the Act there was no provision made in it like section or section The special statute under consideration there gave a right to recover expenses in a court of Summary Jurisdiction from a person who was not otherwise liable at common law It was held that there was no right to come to <ORG> for a declaration that the applicant had a right to recover the expenses in a court of Summary Jurisdiction He could take proceedings only in the latter court I do not think the appellant can claim to recover by virtue of the statute and at the same time insist upon doing so by means other than those prescribed by the statute which alone confers the right Lord Watson said at page The right and the remedy are given uno flatu and the one cannot be dissociated from the other In other words if a statute confers a right and in the same breach provides for a remedy for enforcement of such right the remedy provided by the statute is an exclusive one If a statute intended to compel mine owners to make due provision for the safety of the man working in their mines and the persons for whose benefit all these rules are to be enforced are the persons exposed to danger there arises at common law a co relative right in those persons who may be injured by its contravention Mr <NAME> endeavoured to take his case out of the well established and succinctly enunciated principles of law by the English courts on two grounds That the remedy provided under the Act is no remedy in the eye of law Reference to <ORG> or <ORG> for adjudication of the Industrial dispute was dependant upon the exercise of the power of the <ORG> under section it did not confer any right on the suitor Even if <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for enforcement of a right created under the Act as in England Courts in India also could make an order or decree for injunction to prevent the threatened injury on breach of the right We do not find much force in either of the contentions It is no doubt true that the remedy provided under the Act under section on the facts and in the circumstances of this case involving disputes in relation to the two settlements arrived at between the management and the workmen was not the appropriate remedy If the refusal is not sustainable in law appropriate directions can be issued by <ORG> in exercise of its writ jurisdiction Mr <NAME> very emphatically relied upon the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> in support of his submission that even if a suit could not lie in a civil court for enforcement of the right still the remedy of injunction by a suit was not lost The learned Judge at page in the first instance pointed out that the case before him fell within the first of the three classes enumerated by <NAME> in the case of <NAME> supra Says the learned Judge further at page In my opinion there was nothing to prevent the old <ORG> from granting an injunction to restrain the infringement of a newly created statutory right unless the Act of Parliament creating the right provided a remedy Historically <ORG> had assumed certain special jurisdiction under its original jurisdiction to take cognizance of a special kind of right even though the common law court may not have such jurisdiction In India under section of the Code the <ORG> have subject to certain restrictions jurisdiction to try suits of civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred In the instant case taking cognizance of a suit in relation to an industrial dispute for the enforcement of any kind of right is not expressly barred The great Master of Equity in relation to the remedy in <ORG> said I do not agree to the proposition that there is no remedy in this <ORG> if there be no remedy at law and still less do I agree to the proposition that this <ORG> is bound to send a matter of this description to be tried at law It is plain therefore that in the opinion of Lord <NAME> who was pre eminently distinguished for his knowledge of the principles of this <ORG> the jurisdiction of the <ORG> is not limited to cases in which there is a right at law It will bear repetition to say that the jurisdiction of <ORG> in India is limited to cases in which there is a right at law that is to say a right to be pursued in such Court At page the noble and learned Lord has pointed out that the power of the <ORG> or <ORG> to make declarations of right without giving consequential relief was introduced by section of the <ORG> Procedure Act After some decisions of the English courts some additional words were introduced in order to enlarge the power of the <ORG> to make declarations in cases where from the nature or the circumstances of the case no substantive relief could be given by the <ORG> Suppose a case where a proceeding is initiated by issuance of a notice for imposing a tax on person under a provision of law which is ultra vires a suit for injunction would lie to prevent the threatened action Reliance was placed on behalf of the contesting respondents on the case of <ORG> and another <ORG> This case merely illustrates the distinction already made by us I think that this case comes within the rule that where there is a statutory enactment in favour of a person and there is a penalty for the breach of the statutory enactment which goes to the person aggrieved in such a case the penalty is the only remedy for the breach Reliance was also placed on behalf of the contesting respondents on the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> and others but the decision is of no help to them Viscount <NAME> at pages and has said with reference to the Act of which was under consideration before the <ORG> that the Act provides a person with another remedy and then the question posed is Is it then an alternative or an exclusive remedy Answer given is There is nothing in the Act to suggest that while a new remedy perhaps cheap and expeditious is given the old and as we like to call it the inalienable remedy of Her Majesty subjects to seek redress in her courts is taken away And it appears to me that the case would be unarguable but for the fact that in <NAME> <NAME> supra upon a consideration of the statute there under review it was held that the new statutory remedy was exclusive The well known distinction is brought about in these terms The appellant company are given no new right of quarrying by the Act of On the contrary they deny that they come within its purview and seek a declaration to that effect There is in my opinion nothing in <ORG> supra which denies them that remedy if it is otherwise appropriate The special jurisdiction of <ORG> is further emphasised in a passage quoted with approval at page of the report from the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> Mr <NAME> very strongly relied upon the Full Bench decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> Master <NAME> in support of the plaintiff respondents right to have an order of injunction in this case The passage runs thus If therefore a demand made by a <ORG> is not authorised by the Act and the person affected thereby objects to the payment on the ground that in making the demand the <ORG> was exercising a jurisdiction not vested in it by law it can by no stretch of language be said that he is objecting to his liability to be taxed under the Act We now proceed to consider the cases creating special liability mostly tax liability and providing for procedures and remedies for determination of the amount of tax and relief against the assessment of such liability The order of the Collector of <ORG> passed on the appeal under section of the Sea <ORG> Act was held to be an order within his exclusive jurisdiction excluding the jurisdiction of the Court to challenge it Similarly if an appropriate authority has acted in violation of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure that may also tend to make the proceedings illegal and void and this infirmity may affect the validity of the order passed by the authority in question It is cases of this character where the defect or the infirmity in the order goes to the root of the order and makes it in law invalid and void that these observations may perhaps be invoked in support of the plea that the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction notwithstanding a provision to the contrary contained in the relevant statute In what cases such a plea would succeed it is unnecessary for us to decide in the present appeal because we have no doubt that the contention of the appellant that on the merits the decision of the assessing authority was wrong cannot be the subject matter of a suit because A clearly bars such a claim in the civil courts It would be noticed on appreciation of the above dicta that the issue to be tried in the suit instituted in a civil court to challenge the decision of the taxing authorities is quite distinct and different from the one which is within their exclusive jurisdiction The decision of <ORG> of <ORG> supra was also referred and the final principle enunciated is to be found at page in these terms Under of the Code of Civil Procedure the <ORG> shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of civil nature excepting suits of which cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred The statute may specifically provide for ousting the jurisdiction of civil <ORG>s even if there was no such specific exclusion if it creates a liability not existing before and gives a special and particular remedy for the aggrieved party the remedy provided by it must be followed Civil Courts therefore will have hardly an occasion to deal with the type of cases falling under principle They fell in one category or the other and have expressed divergent views Those which have taken any view contrary to the one expressed by us above must be deemed to have been over ruled in that regard and those falling in line with our views are being affirmed It is not necessary to refer to some unreported decisions of <ORG> taking one view or the other Applying the principles aforementioned to the facts of the instant case it is clear that what the plaintiff respondents wanted to prevent was by and large threatened breach of their right which flowed from the agreement dated the st December entered into between <ORG> and the <ORG> Withdrawal of the claim based upon the said agreement by their learned counsel in <ORG> had no effect on the question of its jurisdiction to try the suit In so far as the suit was filed in a representative capacity on behalf of the members of the <ORG> Even accepting that in their case it had assumed the character of an implied term of contract of service the alternative claim made in paragraph of the plaint as being a condition of service otherwise can be referable to the claim of the non members only The numerous persons must have the same interest in one suit instituted under Order I Rule of the Code Persons having different interests cannot be so represented Hence a suit for a decree for permanent injunction was not maintainable in the civil court as it had no jurisdiction to grant the relief or even a temporary relief But one thing was apparent that both the agreements could not be simultaneously given effect to On the other hand the members of <ORG> who had entered into the second agreement dated the th January were to get their incentive payments in accordance with that agreement taking into account the contribution made in the matter of production by the newly added persons Grant of perpetual injunction is subject to the provision contained in Chapter But sub section provides that when any such obligation arises out of contract the courts shall be guided by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter Section occurring in that Chapter says that a contract which is in its nature determinable cannot be specifically enforced Section providing an exception to this is not attracted in this case We now proceed to briefly state the facts of Civil Appeal No During the pendency of an industrial dispute in I No of workmen of the appellant company were sought to be dismissed and an application for according approval to the dismissal was made under section of the Act Thereupon the union and two of their members instituted the suit on challenging the action of the company on several grounds and praying for an order of injunction to restrain the company from committing a breach of the agreement dated the th March including the breach as regards the payment of wages to the workmen The company asked <ORG> where the suit was instituted to decide the question of jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit as a preliminary issue The same learned Judge sitting singly who later on decided the other case upheld the jurisdiction of the civil court to try the suit The company filed this appeal by special leave On the facts of this case it is all the more clear that the civil court has no jurisdiction to try it The manner of voluntary reference of industrial disputes to arbitration is provided in section A of the Act There is no provision in the Act to compel a party to the agreement to nominate another arbitrator if its nominee has withdrawn from arbitration But in the circumstances we shall make no order as to costs in either of the appeals
