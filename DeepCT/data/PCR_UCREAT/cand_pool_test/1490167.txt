The appellants are landlords or their representatives of different premises in Bombay which have been given on rent to various tenants They had filed in <ORG> writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section Section and Section of the Bombay Rent Act inter alia on the ground that the said provisions pertaining to standard rent were ultra vires Articles and of the Constitution anc consequently void Sections and a which are being impugned in the present cases read as follows Standard rent in relation to any premises means a Where the standard rent is fixed by the <ORG> and the Controller respectively under the Bombay Rent Restriction Act or the Bombay Rents Hotel Rates and Lodging House Rates control Act such standard rent or when the standard rent is not so fixed subject to the provisions of section i the rent at which the premises were let on the first day of September ii where they were not let on the first day of September the rent at which they were last let before that day or iii where they were first let after the first day of September the rent at which they were first let or iii a notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph iii the

fifteen per cent on the investment in the land and building and all the outgoing in respect of such premises or iv on any of the cases specified in section the rent fixed by the <ORG> All the provisions of this Act in respect of the Standard rent and permitted increases in relation to any premises let or if let to a tenant shall mutatis mutandis apply in respect of any license fee or charge and permitted increases and the additional sum mentioned above Subject to the provisions of section A in any of the following cases the <ORG> may upon an application made to it for that purpose or in any suit or proceedings fix the standard rent at such amount as having regard to the provisions of this Act and circumstances of the case the <ORG> deems just Where any premises are first let after the first day of September and the rent at which they are so let is in the opinion of the <ORG> excessive or Where the <ORG> is satisfied that there is no sufficient evidence to ascertain the rent at which the premises were let in any one of the cases mentioned in paragraphs to iii of sub clause of Section or Where by reason of the premises having been let at one item as a whole or imparts and at another time in parts or as a whole or for any other reason any difficulty arises in giving effect to this Part or Where any premises have been or are let rent free or at a nominal rent or for some consideration in addition to rent or Without prejudice to the provisions of sub section A of section and paragraph iii a of sub clause of clause of Section where the Court is satisfied that the rent in respect of the premises referred to therein exceeds the limit of standard rent laid down in the said paragraph iii a or Where there I any dispute between the landlord and the tenant regarding the amount of standard rent Section provides for an increase in rent where after the commencement of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Amendment Act a landlord is required to pay any fresh rate cases charges tax land assessment ground rent of land or any other levy on lands and buildings Increase on account of heavy repairs additional amenities and repairs required to be carried out under requisition from local authorities increase in monthly rent is permitted to the extend of per year on the actual cost incurred without interest Section Increase in ground rent in respect of leasehold premises paid to the government local authority and statutory authority is allowed to be passed on to the tenant by a proportionate increase in monthly rent Section increase in amount of property taxes after is allowed to be passed on to the tenant by a proportionate increase in monthly rent Section The cost which have to be absorbed and borne by the landlord without entitlement to pass on to tenants therefore Entire cost of tenantable repairs which if the landlord does not carry out and the tenant carries out the same the tenant is permitted to deduct and recover the same from the landlord from year to year to the extent of months rent in a year together with interest at the rate of a under Section as amended in by Maharashtra Act No of In the decades of the fifties sixties and seventies the landlord member is invariably out of pocket as the ever increasing amounts of the outgoing and maintenance paid to the <ORG> are invariably more than the actual amount of rent received which had been frozen at first letting In the decade of the eighties and the nineties however the amount of the first letting being considerably higher this incidence does not occur In both classes of cases i the premises let on or before st September and premises let on or after there are no statutory provisions which entitle the landlord to move the Count for an increase in standard rent In reply it was submitted by Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for the respondents that the writ petitions which were filed by the appellants did not give sufficient details as regards the rents which they were receiving from the tenanted premises It was therefore contended that the claims made were hypothetical as there was no sufficient material to decide the truth of the assertions made by the appellants as regards negative returns from their rented properties It was further submitted by the learned counsel that the respondent <ORG> has become aware of the rising prices at least since and this had resulted in Maharashtra Act of being passed whereby the Bombay Rent Act was amended The landlord was further entitled to temporarily increase the rent at a rate not exceeding per cent of the standard rent for special or heavy repairs There is considerable judicial authority in support of the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that with the passage of time a legislation which was justified when enacted may become arbitrary and unreasonable with the change in circumstances in the State of Madhya Pradesh Vs <ORG> dealing with a question whether geographical classification due to historical reasons would be valid this Court at page observed as follows Differential treatment arising out of the application of the laws so continued in different regions of the same reorganised State did not therefore immediately attract the clause of the Constitution prohibiting discrimination the challenge was to the validity of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which granted exemption to the rulers of former India State from being sued except with the consent of the <ORG> Government Dealing with this question it was observed at page as follows If under the Constitution all citizens are equal it maybe desirable to confine the operation of to past transactions and not to perpetuate the anomaly of the distinction between the rest of the citizens and Rulers of former Indian States this Court was called upon to consider the validity of the continued application of the provisions of the Madras Hindu Religious Endowment Act in the area which had formerly been part of State of Madras and which had latter become part of the new State Of Mysore now Karnataka as a result of the State Re Organisation Act Thereby the very foundation of their constitutionality shall have been destroyed the foundation being that section of the State Reorganisation Act serves the significant Purpose of giving reasonable time to the new units to consider the special circumstances obtaining in respect of diverse units This exemption had continued for nearly a quarter of a century and it was argued that because of shortage of housing accommodation since the section had been valid from the commencement of the Act therefore it could not be struck down at any time after it came into force and <ORG> supra it was observed at page as follows what may be unobjectionable as a transitional or temporary measure at an initial stage can still become discriminatory and hence violative of Article of the Constitution of it is persisted in over a long period without any justification Dealing with the contention that the impugned provisions had been in existence for over years and had once been held to be valid by <ORG> and therefore this <ORG> should not pronounce upon its validity at this late stage it was observed at page that what was justifiable during a short period has turned out to be a case of hostile discrimination by lapse of nearly a quarter of century We are constrained to pronounce upon the validity of the impugned provision at this late stage because of grab of constitutionality which it may have possessed earlier has become worn out and its unconstitutionality is now brought to a successful challenge SCC this Court had to consider the validity of Section ii of the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act which provided that tenants of residential building being monthly rent exceeding Rs Holding that the tenants of the residential buildings required greater protection and that there was no justification in picking out the class of tenants of residential buildings paying a rent of more than Rs per month and to deny them the right conferred generally on all tenants of buildings residential or non residential and for this reason holding Section ii of the Said Act as being violative of Article at page and it was observed as follows It certainly cannot be pretended the provision is intended to benefit the weaker sections of the people only a provision which was perfectly valid at the commencement of the Act could be challenged later on the ground of unconstitutionality and struck down on that basis Mr <NAME> referred to the decision of this Court in <NAME> Vs State of Punjab and contended that the ratio of the said decision is clearly applicable to the present case It was held in that case that the act in question had been passed in and it pegged the rent prevalent for similar houses in and as such it was not unreasonable per se Even though there was an increase in the rents after the second world war and the partition of the country it was held that fixing of the rents at the level could not be regarded as unreasonable when one of the objects of the act was to restrict the increase by providing for certain provisions as to fixation of a fair rent There was no argument raised or considered as is being done in the present case while relying on the decision of <ORG> in the cases of <NAME> Motor General Traders and Synthetics and Chemicals supra that with the passage of time and with the consequent change of circumstances the continued operation of an act which was valid when enacted may become arbitrary and unreasonable The correctness or the authenticity of this material has not in any way been doubted an therefore we see no reason as to why this cannot be taken into consideration in order to determine whether the submission of Mr <NAME> merits acceptance In para it observed that having regard to the general increase in the cost of living the <ORG> is of the view that there is a case for some general increase although not to the extent claimed by the property owners as the period of twenty years has elapsed since the last increase was allowed <ORG> which submitted its report in the year recommended the increase in the rents in the following terms the commission feels that there is immediate need for reasonable increase in standard rent Applying the same principle to existing tenancies where rents have remained frozen for at least years what needs to be done is to update those rents by neutralising per cent of the inflation which has taken place from the time of initial determination of those rent upto the present time it was submitted that as a result of these amendments the landlords will be able to charge more rents and it cannot now be said that the Rent Control Act is not valid It is true that some amendments were made in which clearly indicate that <ORG> was conscious of the fact that there was a need to increase the standard rent Provisions contained in the present Sections and A were found earlier prior to the amendment in in Sections A AA AAA and To put simply in a tabulated from the following is the comparative position of rent between and and the amount retained by the landlord Per Month Rent per month inclusive of Municipal Taxes Rs Amount of Municipal Taxes to be paid by Owner Rs Amount of repair cess to be paid by Owner Rs of rateable value Nil Amount retained by owner after payment of Municipal taxes repair cess Rs No correction has been made for The inflation fall in purchasing value of the rupee which was about times between and the value of Rs as on and does not relate to the premises which are let out after the Act had come in force He is therefore suffering a loss of Rs With the passage of time the percentage of rent which would be paid by that hypothetical tenant would have gone down from of his total salary to only and this wold be the case of most of the tenants as we can take judicial notice of the fact that from till now incomes have increased considerably whereas the rent has increased only from Rs One of the protections which has been provided to the tenants in the rent legislation throughout the country is the concept of standard rent It is true that whenever a special provision like the rent control act is made for a section of the <ORG> it may be at the cost of another section but the making of such a provision or enactment may be necessary in the larger interest of the society as a whole but the benefit which is given initially if continued results in increasing injustice to one section of the society and an unwarranted largess or windfall to another without appropriate corresponding relief then the continuation of such a law which necessarily or most likely leads to increase in lawlessness and undermines the authority of the law can no longer be regarded as being reasonable The <ORG> itself as already noticed hereinabove has taken notice of the fact that puggrie system has become prevalent in Mumbai because of the rent restriction act When there is shortage of accommodation it is desirable nay necessary that some protection should be given to the tenants in order to ensure that they are no exploited Taking all the facts and circumstances into consideration we have no doubt that the existing provisions of the Bombay Rent Act relating to the determination and fixation of the standard rent can no longer be considered to be reasonable The said provisions would have been struck down as having now become unreasonable and arbitrary but we think it is not necessary to strike down the same in view of the fact that the present extended period of the Bombay Rent Act comes to an end on st march The new bill is under consideration and we leave it to the legislature to frame a just and fair law keeping in view the interests of all concerned and in particular the resolution of <ORG> of and the National Model law which has been circulated by <ORG> in We are not expressing any opinion on the provisions of the said Model law but as the same has been drafted and circulated amongst all the States after due deliberation and thought there will perhaps have to be very good end compelling reasons in departing from the said Model Law Mr <NAME> assured us that this Model law will be taken into consideration in the framing of the proposed new Rent Control Act We however refrain from striking down the said provision as the existing Act elapses on and we hope that new Rent Control Act will be enacted with effect from st April keeping in view the observations made in this judgment in so far as fixation of standard rent is concerned It is however made clear that any further extension of the existing provisions without bringing them in line with the views expressed in this judgment would be invalid as being arbitrary and violative of Article of the Constitution and therefore of no consequence The respondents will pay the Costs
