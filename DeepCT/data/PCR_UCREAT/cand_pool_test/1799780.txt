This petition under Articles and of the Constitution of India by <ORG> a Company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and having its registered office at No Shoorji Vallabhdas Marg Bombay has been filed against <ORG> the Collector of <ORG> Hyderabad and Assistant Collector of <ORG> <ORG> Visakhapatnam for the issue of a writ of certiorari or any other appropriate writ direction or order to the respondents herein calling for the records and proceedings of the case and after looking into the question of legality and or propriety thereof to quash and set aside orders dated Exhibit to the petition Exhibit I to the petition Exhibit to the petition and Exhibit to the petition for issue of a writ of mandamus or a writ in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ direction or orders against the respondents their officers subordinates servants and agents directing them i to withdraw and or cancel the impugned orders dated th June in so far as it rejects Claim IB and Claim Exhibit hereto rd September Exhibit hereto nd March Exhibit hereto and st October Exhibit hereto and further directing them ii to refund to the petitioners Rs The impugned orders relate to the claims made by the petitioner for refund of excise duty earlier paid by the petitioner allegedly by mistake or misapprehension or on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant law on what the petitioner describes as Burner Fuel Oil the duty whereon was charged treating it to be a finished product called Furnace Oil The total amount claimed by the petitioner was Rs In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties it will be advantageous to go into the history of the payment of the levy in question as well as the process of manufacture of the commodity in question Thereupon the petitioner filed an appeal on th September to the Collector against the rejection of claims and and on th October against the rejection of claim A These appeals were rejected by the Collector <ORG> Hydrabad by his order dated nd March Annexure to the petition A further hearing was given to the petitioner on th October Therefore Burner Fuel Oil is not excisable goods and there is no manufacture of goods within the meaning of the said Act There is no removal of Burner Fuel Oil within the meaning of Rule of the said Rules The order dated rd September passed by Assistant Collector Visakhapatnam is without jurisdiction because he had no power of review or revision of the order passed by his predecessor There is no question of any estoppel against statute There is no inherent power of review The respondents by way of return to the rule nisi have filed a counter affidavit sworn by <NAME> Under Secretary to <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> New Delhi and during the course of the hearing of this case an application supported by an affidavit of <NAME> was taken on record with the consent of the learned counsel for the petitioner It is also contended that at no time was any specific claim of the petitioner allowed and all the three claims were rejected after due inquiry and proper hearing The counter affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents also set out that the refinery or the manufacturing unit of the petitioner is the specified place of manufacture under Rule of the Excise Rules and that Tanks and of are outside the manufacturing unit which are not within the control of the Excise Authorities Mr <NAME> who opened the case for the petitioner formulated the propositions which according to him arose for consideration in this case The points for determination therefore are Whether the consumption of the oil in question is by way of an uninterrupted integrated continuous processor manufacture and whether there is any removal of it from the place of manufacture under Rules and Keeping in mind the definitions of the terms excisable goods manufacture and factory in Section of the Excise Act it has first to be noted that Section of the Act is the charging section under which excisable goods which are produced or manufactured become liable as attracting excise duty at the rates set out in the First Schedule to the Act The basic point for decision in this case therefore is whether this product which is claimed by the petitioner to be Burner Fuel Oil and which according to the respondents was Furnace Oil is a product manufactured in the factory of the petitioner as a manufactured product so as to become excisable goods attracting the levy of excise duty and if so whether payment of duty was required in respect of this product by virtue of the same being issued out of the place or premises specified under Rule or on being removed from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under Rule in terms of Rule of the Excise Rules Therefore what has to be seen is whether the commodity in the present case attracts the levy of excise duty and even if it does whether there was removal within the meaning of the Excise Act and the Excise Rules for collecting excise duty or what may be called assessment of duty which becomes payable by the manufacturer The legislative intent for levy and collection of excise duty on a reading of the Excise Act and the Excise Rules appears to be that no duty is payable on intermediate products if the intermediate products by themselves are not the end products being manufactured by a particular factory provided however the intermediate products and the end products are obtained by one continuous uninterrupted integrated process as opposed to distinct or independent processes We find force in Mr <NAME> contention that the concept of making assessment only at the stage of removal supports this legislative intent Rule is a direction to the excise authorities that the payment of excise duty shall not be demanded until excisable goods are about to be issued out of place or premises specified under Rule or are about to be removed from a tore room or other place or storage approved by the Collector under Rule If there is no removal there would be no question pf payment For example evaporation would not be removal for that takes place by natural causes in the process of manufacture or even afterwards We have therefore to see whether in the present case the product in question is a only an intermediate product obtained in the process of manufacturing of any other finished petroleum product whether this product is treated as an end product or only an intermediate product by processing of which any other product is to be obtained and whether this product can be regarded as having been removed at any stage for any of the purposes mentioned in Rule of the Excise Rules As long as the oil in question is in this manner in the pipeline of the petitioner refinery it continues to be the intermediate product being utilised in one single process for the manufacture of another product and would be the product to fit in with the type of product about which Mr <NAME> has addressed us There is no dispute between the parties about this aspect In that case the contention of Mr <NAME> who appeared for the petitioner was that since the petitioner company had employed a continuous and integrated process for the manufacture of Nylon yarn and since the Polymer Chips that are obtained at an intermediate stage are used or consumed in the further manufacture of the said Nylon yarn without the said Chips being taken out of the equipment the Polymer Chips did not attract levy of excise duty as the same were utilised in a continuous and integrated process for the manufacture of Nylon yarn and also there was no removal within the meaning of Rule read with Rule of the Excise Rules After noticing the various provisions of the Act and the Rules and the process of manufacture in that particular case the earned Judge repelled the contention of the Counsel for the Respondents that the Polymer Chips attracted duty and held that inasmuch as the Polymer Chips that were obtained by the petitioner company did not go out of the manufacturing equipment until the final product of Nylon yarn was obtained the said Polymer Chips formed part of an uninterrupted integrated process of manufacturing Nylon yarn and there was no removal or issuing out of the Polymer Chips within the meaning of Rule read with Rule of the Excise Rules The decision is not helpful in the circumstances of the present case for there can be no dispute with the proposition that an intermediately product used for obtaining an end product in a single uninterrupted process would not attract duty Reference was then made to the decision of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Civil Writ No of <ORG> Kota The Collector of <ORG> Delhi Central Revenue Buildings Mathura Road Delhi decided on th August It was also urged that in the process of manufacture of Nylon yarn adopted by the petitioner company there was no removal of the Polymer Chips and so in any case duty cannot be levied on the same in view of the provisions of Rule read with Rule <NAME> held that Polymer Chips produced by the petitioner company were not covered by Item No A iii of the First Schedule to the Excise Act and on this ground allowed the petition We may now advert to the question of removal which is pertinent in view of Rule of the Excise Rules for collection of Excise Duty Rule which we have read earlier in terms lays down that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced or any specified premises appurtenant thereto whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable has been paid It obviously makes no reference to the plant or equipment The integrated continuous process content plated by Rule read with Rules in Chapter A comes to an end when no further processing is to be done of that particular product and thereafter If such product is utilised for consumption or what in excise parlance is known as home consumption or exported or used for manufacture of any other commodity in or outside the place of manufacture the excise levy is attracted We cannot persuade ourselves to agree with the contention raised on behalf Of the petitioner that the consumption of this oil for heating purposes is part of the process of manufacture and no removal takes places from the plant Accordingly the meaning to be given to the word production as commercial production has also no relevance It has not been shown to us whether bagasse attracts excise levy but even if it did it will make no difference to the proposition of law for if in a particular plant use of bagasse forms an integrated process it would attract levy The contention is that the statute gives no power of review to any officer and so the order of rd September was without jurisdiction inasmuch as this order could not review the earlier order dated th June It was held in construing the scheme of the East Punjab Holdings Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation Act that inasmuch as no court or authority has power of setting aside an order which has been properly made unless it is given by statute an order once made by an authority cannot be reviewed unless there is a specific provision giving the power of review If the order of rd September amounts to a review of the order dated th June as far as it relates to claim A then no doubt it must be set aside but in our view the order of th June makes it clear that Claims and were specifically rejected and against that the petitioner could file an appeal as it did It is the oil covered by claims and about which there was some dispute of further processing and this dispute not being there in respect of oil coming direct from <ORG> to tanks and the same was separated from the consolidated claims earlier made by the petitioner No question of review therefore arises and the order of rd September cannot be regarded as one passed reviewing the order dated th June Mr <NAME> who appeared for the Collector of Excise raised some technical objections to any relief being granted to the petitioner It was therefore urged that inasmuch as the petitioner case is that it paid the amount through inadvertence error or misconstruction and the application for refund has been made more than three months from the date of payment the duty is not refundable and there is no power to condone the delay in making the application similar to Section of the Limitation Act This plea has not been specifically taken in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Collector but in paragraph of the counter affidavit there is a mention of laches and delay It is contended that law as such need not be pleaded and the specific provisions of the statue could always be relied upon if pleaded only generally There being no right to claim a refund there is no legal duty cast upon the respondents which can be enforced by mandamus Inasmuch as the permit was validly terminated the appellant had no right which he could enforce when he moved the court Admittedly the petitioner was paying duty on the oil in question as furnace oil right till and it was only after the relaxation was made in and claims were invited by the letter dated rd August addressed to the petitioner that the question of claiming the refund arose It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that there is no manifest error in the impugned orders which shock the conscience of the court so as to call for interference under writ jurisdiction
