It is contended that as an appeal lies from the order made by the District Judge the appellant petition under Section was not maintainable and that therefore it was properly rejected It is urged on behalf of respondent that as he is not an assignee of the decree but one who attached it under Section the above rulings are not applicable It is further contended that the objection that the District Judge order is appealable was not urged before the learned Judge or before us when we made our former order We dismiss this appeal but under the circumstances without costs
