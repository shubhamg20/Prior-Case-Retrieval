In A was declared an evacuee and the appellant was given notice by the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property to show cause why the land should not be declared evacuee property The Custodian did not accept the plea and observed that if the appellant was aggrieved by the decision he could obtain a declaration of his rights from a competent court The subordinate Judge held that the court had jurisdiction because of A disagreed with the Subordinate Judge and reversed his decision The appellant then came to this Court by special leave Any person aggrieved by an order of such an authority made under has the right to appeal under and if necessary to go in revision under The Act thus provides a complete machinery for a person interested in any property to put forward his claims before the competent authorities Nor could it be said on the facts found that the appellant had become the owner of the property before for admittedly the property was worth more than Rs But the present suit had been filed to establish the right of the appellant as owner of the property and in such a suit the appellant could not take the benefit of A The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The only question raised in this appeal on a certificate granted by <ORG> is whether the suit brought by the appellant is barred under of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act No of hereinafter referred to as the Act In that connection the appellant received notice from the Deputy Custodian in December under of the Act asking him to show cause why the land should not be declared evacuee property Thereafter the appellant was given a notice requiring him to surrender possession of the land to the <NAME>dar The appellant then made representation before the Deputy Custodian that he had purchased the property from <NAME> in and was the owner thereof from before the Evacuee Property Law came into force The Custodian did not accept this recommendation on the ground that there was no registered sale deed duly executed by <NAME> in favour of the appellant and no transfer of property could therefore be said to have taken place in and ordered that the declaration of the property as evacuee property should stand and further said that if the appellant was aggrieved by this decision he could obtain a declaration of his rights from a competent court The suit was resisted by the Custodian and the main contention raised on his behalf was that the suit was barred under of the Act of and that the civil court had jurisdiction inasmuch as the sale had taken place before <ORG> reversed the decision of the Subordinate Judge and held that the appellant had been given notice under of the Act in December and did not appear before the Deputy Custodian with the result that the property was declared as evacuee property <ORG> further held that after this declaration the appellant remedy was to proceed by way of appeal or revision under the Act and that a suit was barred in view of thereof The appellant then obtained a certificate from <ORG> to appeal to this Court and that is how the matter has come up before us We are of opinion that there is no force in this appeal It is unnecessary to consider the cases cited at the bar on behalf of the appellant for whatever may be the position of law where the title of the evacuee himself is in dispute as to which we express no opinion there can be no doubt that where the property admittedly belonged to the evacuee and the person filing the suit claims to be a transferee from the evacuee the suit would certainly be barred in view of of the Act Section inter alia lays down that save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act no civil or revenue court shall have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any property or any right to or interest in any property is or is not evacuee property It is admitted that the appellant had received notice from the Deputy Custodian under of the Act but had neglected to appear before him and it was in those circumstances that the Deputy Custodian declared the property to be evacuee property Any person aggrieved by an order of such an authority made under has the right to appeal under and if necessary to go in revision under The Act thus provides a complete machinery for a person interested in any property to put forward his claims before the authorities competent to deal with the question and to go in appeal and in revision if the person interested feels aggrieved Where therefore the property or any right to or interest in any property undoubtedly belonged to the evacuee and any transferee from the evacuee claims the property or any right to or interest therein he has to avail of the remedies provided under the Act Nor can it be said on the facts found in the present case that the appellant had become the owner of the property before for admittedly the property was worth more than Rs But the present suit has been filed to establish the right of the appellant as owner of the property and in such a suit the appellant cannot take the benefit of A of the Transfer of Property Act We therefore hold in agreement with <ORG> that the suit is clearly barred under a of the Act
