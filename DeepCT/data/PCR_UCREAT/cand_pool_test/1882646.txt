exercises the powers conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a congizable offence a Police officer within the meaning of Section of the Indian Evidence Act Now Section of the Indian Evidence Act provides No confession made to a Police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence I may also refer to Section which provides No Magistrate or Police officer shall be com pelted to say whence he got any information as to the commissions of any offence and no Revenue officer shall be compelled to say whence he got any information as to the commission of any offence against the public revenue Was then the Excise officer in the present case a Police officer within the meaning of Section Now it is quite clear that under the Bombay Abkari Act as amended by subsequent Acts certain important powers possessed by the ordinary police under the Criminal are given to particular Abkari officers Section provides Every Abkari officer not below such rank as Government may prescribe shall within the area for which he is appointed have power to investigate all offences punishable under this Act Every such officer shall in the conduct of such investigation exercise the powers conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence There are also certain special powers of arrest under Section A and Section provides for what is to be done as regards a person arrested under Section A Section provides The provisions of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply to all arrests made without warrant by Abkari officers They include the important power of examining persons supposed to be acquainted with the facts see Section powers of arrest so far as the Criminal is concerned are contained in other sections Substantially therefore to all intents and purposes we get here a person exercising all the material powers of a <ORG> officer although he is not officially called by that name but by the name of an <ORG> officer Now what was the object of Section of the Evidence Act It was I take it to prevent the abuse of their powers by the police in this country in extorting confessions from persons in their custody and I take it that one of the most important periods during which the accused persons were intended to be protected by the <ORG> was when the case was being investigated by the Police officers and when the accused were perhaps solely in police custody and not allowed to see any other person Therefore so far as the spirit of the Act is concerned we have the same possibilities of evil when an Excise officer investigates a case as we should have in the case of an investigation by Police officers in charge of a police station under the Criminal He was also a Magistrate and it was accordingly contended that the confession having been made to him as a Magistrate it was admissible under Section and that Section overrode Section Dealing with this argument the Chief Justice at says with respect to Section Its humane object is to prevent confessions obtained from accused persons through any undue influence being received as evidence against them I consider that the term police officer should be read not in any strict technical sense but according to its more comprehensive and popular meaning Accordingly it was held that the confession in question was made to a <ORG> officer and was therefore inadmissible in which it was held that the term police officer in these sections should be read not in any strict technical sense but according to its more comprehensive and popular meaning and we are of opinion that the evidence of the confession was inadmissible Accordingly <ORG> was dealing with a case where the officer at most had a limited power of arrest It is urged by the pleader for the accused in his able argument that this decision of <ORG> was obiter because the Court held that in any event the alleged confessions were not confessions within the meaning of Section or Section as they were really in the nature of exculpatory statements see page I do not think it is possible that the Excise Officers in this case could be said to be Police Officers and that the statements made by the first and the second accused were not admissible by reason of the fact that they were made to Police officers We therefore dismiss the appeal Under these circumstances it seems to me that the Calcutta case is clearly distinguishable and that in following that case without referring to the important distinction which at present exists between the powers possessed by the Calcutta and <ORG> officers respectively the tamed Judges in the Bombay case fell into an error The result is that there is no authority precisely in point in this case and we have really to determine a new point After giving then my best attention to the arguments which have been addressed to us in my judgment we should hold that as <ORG> has deliberately conferred upon these <ORG> officers substantially all the powers of a <ORG> officer they have thereby in effect made them <ORG> officers within the meaning of Section and that accordingly any confession made to such an officer in the course of his investigation under the <ORG> Act or the Criminal Procedure Code is inadmissible in evidence It seems to me therefore not to be an unduly wide construction of Section to say that a Police officer there includes an officer of <ORG> with such wide police powers as those we find here The Evidence Act was passed in and this particular provision in Section was passed in and therefore before the present amended sections of the Bombay Abkari Act came in force On a careful consideration then of the whole case I would answer the question submitted to us in the affirmative and hold that the confession in question was inadmissible in evidence Having regard to the reason of the rule laid down in Section of the Indian Evidence Act and having regard to the decisions which have been already referred to it is clear to my mind that the term <ORG> officer used in the section is not to be understood in any technical sense but includes an officer who is vested with the powers of the police by law It is not necessary for me to refer to all the sections under which he has got certain limited powers of arrest and search Act XII of under the old Section he had practically no powers of investigation and that after an accused person was arrested it was part of his duty to send him to an officer in charge of a police station That section as it stood before was altered by the <ORG> and it has been provided in Sub section of Section that Every such officer i the officer referred to in Sub section shall in the conduct of such investigation exercise the powers conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence It seems to me a perfectly fair interpretation of Section to say that the <ORG> officer within the meaning of that section is an officer who exercises the powers of police conferred upon him by law whether he is called a <ORG> officer or he is called by any other name and exercises other functions also under other provisions of law He is a <ORG> officer within the meaning of Section if in the investigation of offences under a particular Act he exercises the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence conferred upon him by that Act Section of the Indian Evidence Act embodies an important rule which is to be given effect to as a matter of substance and not as a mere matter of form It is not merely the name given to an officer that should determine whether he is a <ORG> officer but the substantial fact whether he exercises the powers of a <ORG> officer conferred upon him by law should determine it The broad ground for not admitting confessions made to a <ORG> officer is to avoid the danger of admitting false confessions That ground would apply as much to an <ORG> officer exercising the powers conferred upon him by Section of the Abkari Act as amended as to a <ORG> officer However that may be the case shows that the learned Judges were prepared to hold that <ORG> officers exercising the powers under Section of the Opium Act as amended by the Bombay Act would not be Police officers The view taken in the leading case Therefore when the learned Advocate General contends that Section of the Evidence Act does not cover a <ORG> officer or any other officer on whom by statute certain powers of the police are conferred and that to say it does cover such an officer is to read the section as if it said including officers who can reasonably be regarded as Police officers then the answer is that we are merely acting on a construction adopted by the <ORG>s long ago and tacitly accepted by the <ORG> I think an important fact to be borne in mind is that prior to the amendment of the Abkari Act by Bombay Act XII of an Excise officer after arresting a person had forthwith to send him to the nearest police station and the investigation was then conducted by Police officers whereas now an Excise officer if empowered under Section can exercise police powers of investigation which cover a certain amount of detention of the accused while the investigation is going on so that he has similar opportunities of extorting a confession from an accused I think the question should be answered in the affirmative It will be noted that prior to the Bombay Amending Act XII of any confession made to a <ORG> officer in charge of a police station in the course of his investigation of any offence was disallowed <ORG> could not have intended by delegating the investigation of offences under the Abkari Act to an Abkari Inspector to deprive a person accused of an offence under the Abkari Act of the protection he enjoyed under Section of the Evidence Act before Bombay Act XII of was passed I arrive at my conclusion on the particular circumstances of this case
