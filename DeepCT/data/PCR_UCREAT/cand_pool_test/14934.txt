This request of the petitioner was negatived by the department as also by the <ORG> in the view that it does not fall within the ambit of the proviso as it stood at the relevant time In this case it is urged by Sri <NAME> that the instant case attracts the applicability of the proviso and consequently his client is entitled to the exemption contemplated by the proviso It is convenient at this stage to extract the terms of the relevant proviso which is as under Provided that in the case of a sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise the amount of the consideration relating to such sale shall be excluded from his turnover when such produce is sold in the form in which it was produced without subjecting it to any physical or chemical or other process to prepare it for consumption save mere cleaning and grading or sorting It is only when the produce loses its original character then the further question arises whether the physical process is only that of cleaning grading or sorting In the absence of any alteration in its original form or character the fact that the process which the produce undergoes does not amount to cleaning grading or sorting would not make any difference The parties will bear their own costs throughout
