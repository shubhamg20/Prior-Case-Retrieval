The said respondents filed a writ petition questioning the validity of Development Control Regulation No DCR framed by the State of Maharashtra in terms of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act for short the MRTP Act WRIT PROCEEDINGS The writ petition questioning the validity of DCR by the First and Second Respondents was filed allegedly to protect the interests of the residents of Mumbai and to improve the quality of life in the town of Mumbai which is said to have drastically been deteriorated during the last fifteen years as also for preventing further serious damage to the town planning and ecology so as to avoid an irretrievable breakdown of the city The said Chamber Summons was allowed by an order dated directing We are fully satisfied that the amendments sought are necessary and essential in the above Petition especially when the above petition is a PIL petition which is yet to be admitted The Respondents will have full opportunity to deal with these amendments by filing an additional affidavit in reply vii Doctrine of prospective overruling has no application in the instant case All sales of Mill lands carried out by <ORG> are clearly contrary to the <ORG> orders dated th May and th September and contrary to the sanctioned BIFR schemes iv <ORG> should take all such measures as are necessary to protect and encourage the industry and not contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith Submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the Appellants and supporting respondents are as under Re DCR A DCR as amended in shall apply not only to a sick mill but also to a closed mill being unviable which had opted for revival modernization shifting It came into force with effect from th January Section permits modification of a Development Plan by <ORG> or in cases of urgency by <ORG> in exercise of its power under Sub section AA of Section which reads as under AA a Notwithstanding anything contained in sub sections A and where <ORG> is satisfied that in the public interest it is necessary to carry out urgently a modification of any part of or any proposal made in a final Development Plan of such a nature that it will not change the character of such Development Plan <ORG> may on its own publish a notice in the Official Gazette and in such other manner as may be determined by it inviting objections and suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed modification not later than one month from the date of such notice and shall also serve notice on all persons affected by the proposed modifications and <ORG> Section confers power to grant such permission whereas Section makes it mandatory for the planning authority to have due regard to the provisions of the draft of final plan or a sanctioned plan Section of the MRTP Act empowers <ORG> or <ORG> to make regulations consistent with the provisions thereof or the rules made thereunder inter alia to carry out the purposes thereof Sub section of Section empowers <ORG> to make special development control regulations consistent therewith and the rules made thereunder to carry out the purpose of executing a Special Township Project and such regulations may be a part of Development Control Regulations or Development Plan or Regional Plan as the case may be carpet area if and when a cotton textile mill is shifted or the mill owner establishes a diversified industry he shall offer on priority in the relocated mill or the diversified industry as the case may be employment to the worker or at least one member of the family of the worker in the employ of the mill on the st January who possesses the requisite qualification or skills for the job for the purpose of Clause above the cotton textile mill owner shall undertake and complete training of candidates for employment before the recruitment of personnel and starting of the relocated mill or diversified industry takes place REASONS FOR AMENDMENT We may at this juncture take notice of the stand taken by the <ORG> before <ORG> While meeting the contentions raised by the Writ Petitioners it was stated I say that a reference to <ORG> has been made in my earlier affidavit dated nd March The deponent of the said affidavit further denied and disputed the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that the Government intended to side with the private developers at the cost of the city as a whole and had not made any amendment in furtherance of the Charles Correa Committee Report The said stand of the <ORG> however underwent some change when the same deponent in his third affidavit dated th August in purported clarification of the earlier stand of the <ORG> stated I am making this further affidavit in order to explain the position with regard to the change made with regard to Regulation and the clarification issued on March It was the view of the Department that in order to make revival feasible and possible the area available after demolition of existing structure should be excluded from computation of the land to be shared It took into consideration other factors namely transport urban form open spaces and employment generation In Paragraph it made some suggestions for giving encouragement to revival of mills stating Hence the provisions of rule should be made more attractive and in order to promote revival the mills owners should be permitted to use the development rights of the open lands to be handed over to municipal corporation in the lands of their share as per column of the aforesaid Table even if such lands are situate in Mumbai island and for this purpose the prevailing provision of rule should be amended as per section From what has been noticed hereinbefore it is evident that as per the suggestion of <ORG> the words or newly were omitted as according to it it may give rise to a lot of confusion The court must be satisfied that there is some element of public interest involved in entertaining such a petition The court also cautioned that before entertaining a writ petition and passing an interim order overwhelming public interest should be taken into consideration therefor It may be true that the Appellant did not file any application questioning similar allotments but it is well settled if an illegality is brought to the notice of the court it can in certain situations exercise its power of judicial review suo motu This Court times without number however has laid down the law as regard limited scope of public interest litigation But we cannot also shut our eyes to the fact that this Court has entertained a large number of public interest litigations for protection of environmental and or ecology PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION Before us the learned counsel appearing for the parties have relied on several principles of interpretation of statute The golden rule of interpretation is that unless literal meaning given to a document leads to anomaly or absurdity the principles of literal interpretation should be adhered to We have also been asked by the learned counsel for the parties to interpret the impugned legislation in the light of constitutional scheme and in particular Articles and of the Constitution of India the provisions of the MRTP Act the doctrine of sustainable development and various other principles In <NAME> Statutory Interpretation purposive construction has been described in the following manner A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives effect to the legislative purpose by a following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose in this Code called a purposive and literal construction or applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in accordance with the legislative purpose in the Code called a purposive and strained construction SCR it was stated Before examining the contentions on the points of law raised in this case it is necessary to appreciate what the Act sought to achieve and why it was brought on the statute book this Court stated If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act In The Interpretation and Application of Statutes <NAME> at discussed the subject while dealing with the importance of context of the statute in the following terms The essence of the language is to reflect express and perhaps even affect the conceptual matrix of established ideas and values that identifies the culture to which it belongs Having noticed the principles of purposive construction we may take note of certain other principles which are necessary to be considered for proper interpretation of DCR It is well settled principle of law that in the absence of any context indicating a contrary intention the same meaning would be attached to the word used in the latter as is given to them in the earlier statute It is trite that the words or expression used in a statute before and after amendment should be given the same meaning When the legislature uses the same words in a similar connection it is to be presumed that in the absence of any context indicating a contrary intention the same meaning should attach to the words In <NAME> <NAME> AC Lord <NAME> as regards conscious omission from the statute stated the law thus I see no reason to suppose that all these omissions were accidental and as little reason to suppose that the enactments with regard to personal disabilities were intentionally left out whilst the express mention made of common informers was omitted through accident or inadvertence We would refer to the said principle in some details later INTERPRETATION OF ACT AND REGULATIONS DCR has been attempted to be interpreted in more than one manner by the learned counsel appearing for the parties The State has been conferred with a special power to frame development control regulations in terms of Section of the MRTP Act The planning authority is not only required to obtain statutory sanction and approval wherever applicable but the State has also been conferred with a special power to make a development plan subject of course to the condition that the same shall not change the character of such development plan The <ORG> when it exercises its power under Section of the MRTP Act is required to act within the four corners of the Act SCOPE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW VIS VIS LEGISLATIVE POLICY A policy decision as is well known should not be lightly interfered with but it is difficult to accept the submissions made on behalf of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants that the courts cannot exercise their power of judicial review at all By reason of any legislation whether enacted by the legislature or by way of subordinate legislation the <ORG> gives effect to its legislative policy The scope and extent of judicial review of legislation it is trite would vary from case to case The sources of framing regulations and bye laws are different and distinct but the same in our opinion would not mean that the court will have no jurisdiction to interfere with any policy decision legislative or otherwise Furthermore there are innumerable cases where this Court has even issued directions despite the fact that the field is covered by some statute or subordinate legislation By way of example we may point out that by interpreting Article this <ORG> has created new rights including right to environmental protection For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that in cases where constitutionality and or interpretation of any legislation be it made by the <ORG> or an executive authority by way of delegated legislation is in question it would be idle to contend that a court of superior jurisdiction cannot exercise the power of judicial review We would have to bear some of the aforementioned principles in mind while adverting to the rival contentions raised at the bar in regard to interpretation of DCR as well as constitutionality thereof It refers to a case of redevelopment Hardly any development took place We may now attempt to understand the effect of FSI having regard to a concrete example We do not accept the contention of Mr <NAME> that clause applies to open land as also lands after demolition of existing structure in case of a redevelopment scheme and only because the words and lands after demolition of existing structures had been deleted the same may not be of much significance inasmuch as clause of the new regulations will have to be construed in the light of clause a It will bear repetition to state that whereas clause a refers to change of user in relation to the existing built up area clause provides for open lands The manner in which the development and or redevelopment should take place has been clubbed in sub regulation of DCR read with sub regulation thereof We have also to take note of the fact that the newly built up area as existing in the old clause a of sub Regulation of DCR has been omitted the effect whereof would be noticed a little later However for the purpose of giving effect to the said provisions the rule of purposive construction is required to be taken recourse to There is no change in Note i or Note ii Things however may be different in a case where the mill owner demolishes a portion of the existing structure and construct new areas so as to be called newly built up area on that part of the land remaining the other part of the structure that it will come within the purview of clause a inasmuch as approval for development would be necessary for the newly built up area for change of user There is no dispute as regard grant of better facility to the mill owners through <ORG> The fact that the <ORG> intended to consider the matter relating to amendment having regard to the fact that there had hardly been any takers for the Scheme as it failed to provide sufficient incentives cannot be ignored It was therefore not in substitution of the resolution of nor was it framed by way of recasting thereof There were multiple options and one mill or the other may fall in more than one category The purpose for introducing the said amendment therefore was for a different purpose and could not have been used for the purpose of construction of DCR We do not find any merit in the said contention as keeping in view of our finding aforementioned the built up area was required to be deducted therefrom We do not furthermore agree with the approach of <ORG> in interpreting the aforementioned provisions having regard to certain other factors namely deluge in Bombay in the year as also the requirements of the entire population of Bombay from environmental aspect At this juncture we may consider the cases of the closed mills It is a rule of the common law which may be referred to as the commonsense construction rule that when considering in relation to the facts of the instant case which of the opposing constructions of the enactment would give effect to the legislative intention the court should presume that the legislator intended common sense to be used in construing the enactment It is presumed that <ORG> intend that the court when considering in relation to the facts of the instant case which of the opposing constructions of an enactment corresponds to its legal meaning should find against a construction which produces an absurd result since this is unlikely to have been intended by <ORG> Where each of the constructions contended for involves some anomaly then in so far as the court uses anomaly as a test it has to balance the effect of each construction and determine which anomaly is greater It may be however that the anomaly is clearly intended when effect must be given to the intention Before effecting a closure under the Industrial Disputes Act notice has to be given to the <ORG> and in certain cases its prior permission is also required to be obtained In such a case even in terms of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act having regard to the purport and object for which the same had been enacted the authorities thereunder as also for the <ORG> a duty is cast to restore back the industrial peace It was enacted in the public interest so as to make special provisions with a view to securing the timely detection of sick and potentially sick companies owning industrial undertakings the speedy determination by <ORG> of the preventive ameliorative remedial and other measures which need to be taken with respect to such companies the expeditious enforcement of the measures so determined and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Section of <ORG> defines industrial company to mean a company which owns one or more industrial undertakings Section of <ORG> provides for reference to a <ORG> where an industrial company has become a sick industrial company for determination of the measures which should be adopted with respect thereto Section provides for the power of <ORG> to make suitable orders on the completion of inquiry Various provisions have been laid down in Chapter III of <ORG> enabling the <ORG> to issue several directions Section of <ORG> provides for a non obstante clause stating that the provisions thereof shall prevail notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the Memorandum or Articles of Association of an industrial company or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law except enactments specified therein The question as regards the interpretation of the sick industries contained in sub regulation of DCR must be considered from that perspective However sub regulation of DCR may not be available to an applicant intending to modernize its mill where aggregation is not resorted to and no demolition of the existing built up area is involved as also open lands balance FSI are utilized for additional constructions as per DCR but in appropriate cases evidently it has to share It would apply to a case which might have otherwise been covered by sub regulations and If sub regulation of DCR is read in the manner suggested by the learned counsel for the Respondents other parts of DCR would have been unnecessary So far as <ORG> mills are concerned development had taken place as a package of measure recommended by <ORG> As the said provisions contain a safeguard namely prior approval of the Commissioner all the mill owners irrespective of the fact that they fall in different categories in terms of the regulations would thus be entitled to take benefit of clause subject to strict compliance of other provisions It proceeded on the basis that if the said provision is read down the same would render the provision constitutional But invariably the <ORG> would satisfy itself as to whether relevant factors as laid down in the legislative act had been taken into consideration The question however raised in these appeals is as to whether requirements to obtain such expert opinion so as to enable the court to look at the quality of the input both with reference to its source as also the scope thereof is mandatory in nature In case of an executive action the court can look into and consider several factors namely i Whether the discretion conferred upon the statutory authority had been property exercised ii Whether exercise of such discretion is in consonance with the provisions of the Act iii Whether while taking such action the executive government had taken into consideration the purport and object of the Act iv Whether the same subserved other relevant factors which would affect the public in large Whether the principles of sustainable development which have become part of our constitutional law have been taken into consideration and vi Whether in arriving at such a decision both substantive due process and procedural due process had been complied with We however are unable to uphold the contention of Mr <NAME> as at present advised that before making DCR in the year it was obligatory on the part of the <ORG> to accept in toto the recommendations made by the Expert Committees who had undertaken certain exercises the equities should have been adjusted and the provisions of the pollution laws including the provisions of sub section of Section of the MRTP Act should have been considered They have been taken into consideration by the <ORG> may albeit be only in part the Government exercising its delegated legislative power should make a real and earnest attempt to apply the criteria laid down by itself The court normally would lead in favour of environmental protection in view of the creative interpretation made by this <ORG> in finding a right of environmental including right to clear water air etc It must be borne in mind while interpreting DCR that there exists a stark distinction between the interpretation of planning and zoning statutes enforcing ecology vis vis industrial effluents and hazardous industries and those relating to concerted efforts at rehabilitating the industry it is stated that zoning laws should be construed strictly in favour of the property owners and that they should not be extended by implication to include restrictions not clearly prescribed We must take notice of the fact that the Regulation failed to achieve the desired objective forcing the <ORG> to take a conscious policy decision which according to it would satisfy everybody need However the submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants to the effect that the said clarification is binding and conclusive upon all concerned cannot be accepted It may have a persuasive value We may however place on record that similar interpretation must be held to have been made by <ORG> as it granted sanction in respect of several plans in the line of interpretation made by the <ORG> Similarly the letter dated issued by the Chief Executive Officer of <ORG> to <ORG> or the <ORG> Government also does not talk about the incorrectness or otherwise of the clarification issued by the <ORG> but as regards the effect of DCR of <ORG> before us categorically stated that it would abide by the decision of the <ORG> of Maharashtra despite the letter dated which was made the only basis for filing the affidavit before <ORG> vi DCR itself contemplates absence of sharing obligation so long as there was no increase in the built up area of the existing structure CONTEMPORANEOUS EXPOSITO EXECUTIVE CONSTRUCTION It was contended by the petitioners before us that <ORG> ought to have applied the doctrine of contemporanea exposito while interpreting DCR of and the Clarification of We have indicated hereinbefore that we do not agree with the said contention but as the learned counsel appearing for the appellants have relied upon some decisions of this Court the same may be noticed at this juncture The Court itself held that the principles adopted in interpretation of treaties are not the same as those in interpretation of a statutory legislation on the ground that the principle which needs to be kept in mind in the interpretation of the provisions of an international treaty including one for double taxation relief is that treaties are negotiated and entered into at a political level and have several considerations as their basis whereas a statute has to be interpreted keeping in mind the well known principles or canons of interpretation of statutes wherein it was held that the court interpreting the statute would give much weight to the interpretation We need to make it clear that regardless of the interpretation that we have placed on the said phrase if there are circulars which have been issued by <ORG> which place a different interpretation upon the said phrase that interpretation will be binding upon the <ORG> Interpretation of the Constitution is the sole prerogative of the constitutional courts and the stand taken by the executive in a particular case cannot determine the true interpretation of the Constitution From what we have noticed hereinbefore it is abundantly clear that the principle of contemporaneous expositio cannot be said to have universal application ARE REGULATIONS AND CLARFICIATION ULTRA VIRES SECTION OF THE MRTP ACT We may with a view to examine the said question more closely take note of the following facts which more or less are undisputed Section AA of the MRTP Act itself suggests that the changes would be of such nature that would not change the character of such development plan which would be otherwise permissible in terms of Section It would give rise to a further question namely as to whether by reason thereof a radical transformation has taken place as regards its basic features including its identity which a fortiori would mean as to whether the modified development plan stands unrecognized from the original one Here the court was considering the question as to whether discretion vested in the executive head had correctly been exercised or not We are not concerned with such a question in the instant case The question as regard the process of modification of a plan came up for consideration in Legg Ilea All ER wherein it was stated the process involved in modification is thus one of alteration and it must be considered how radical the alteration is In that case <ORG> while allowing a proposal for modification submitted by <ORG> added some words which were challenged on the ground that the same was beyond the powers of <ORG> under Section We may place on record that the total area affected by the change on an average would be approximately of the total area of the wards and the mill lands occupy only of the entire land area of Bombay When the question as regard validity or otherwise of the Regulations came up for consideration before <ORG> <NAME> as the learned Judge then was speaking for the Division Bench in <ORG> WP No of wherein the writ petitioners also were parties observed that the word modification being somewhat indefinite in its ambit must be distinguished from a radical illustration <ORG> defines sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs ii Where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage lack of scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation The Court ruled that SCC para once the activity carried on is hazardous or inherently dangerous the person carrying on such activity is liable to make good the loss caused to any other person by his activity irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care while carrying on his activity If there is a law made by <ORG> or <ORG> the courts can serve as an instrument of determining legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the Constitution A land use plan should be prepared not only having regard to the provisions contained in the Act and the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder but also the provisions of other statutes enacted therefor and in particular those for protection and preservation of ecology and environment Article guarantees a right to a decent environment and thus what should be the parameters therefor would essentially be a legislative policy He further relied upon a decision of <ORG> in South Bucks District Council <ORG> <NAME> and others All ER wherein it was held Over the past years there has been ever increasing recognition of the need to control the use and development of land so as to prevent inappropriate development and protect the environment Herein an attempt has been made to interpret DCR in such a manner so that it not only enures to the benefit of the whole community but also give effect to the purport and object thereof An expert body albeit within the fourcorners of the regulatory provisions would be entitled to consider the entire question from the environmental aspect of the matter which would undoubtedly take into consideration all relevant factors including the question as to whether the same is likely to have adverse effects on ecology or not Whereas the court would take a very strict view as regard setting up of an industry which is of a harazardous nature but such a strict construction may not be resorted to in the case of town planning This however has no relevance in the present case The problem will have to be addressed from the point of view that as a part of the scheme framed by the <ORG> in making DCR the money would be invested not only for the purpose of revivial and or rehabilitation of the sick or closed mills the same would also give a boost to modernization and or shifting of mills and or parts thereof from residential area to outside the town of Bombay If some mills opt for modernization the ecological impact would be lesser than the mills which are existing for a very long time It was contended by some of the Appellants that the said notification will have no application in the matters they represent contentions have also been raised that despite the said notification having come into force the building plans are being sanctioned and constructions to a large extent are being carried out without obtaining clearance from <ORG> It is however one thing to say as to what actual area would be available for public greens but it is another thing to say that by reason thereof a change in the character of plan itself has taken place as a result whereof the green areas would be reduced The contentions raised by the Appellants may or may not be correct It must also be placed on record that civic load in respect of residential construction so far as land occupied by the mills owners was more than the present ratio of FSI at FSI given for construction of buildings to MHADA itself would be i almost It is contended on behalf of the Appellants that out of the total area of sq The mills occupied lands measuring about acres The said Act received the assent of the President of India on st December It came into force from st day of April <ORG> again enacted the Textile Undertakings Nationalisation Act for short the Act for acquisition and transfer of textile undertakings specified in the First Schedule appended thereto with a view to augmenting the production and distribution of different varieties of cloth and yarn so as to subserve the interests of the general public for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Specific assurances were given to the bidders by <ORG> that deficiencies in open space shall be made good by making available equivalent open space from its other mills in the vicinity in the event the writ petition was allowed It was furthermore clarified that assuming that the court decides otherwise then <ORG> has other mills to offer as far as the share of <ORG> and <ORG> is concerned and <ORG> will take care of the interest of the purchasers Only sale of land from <ORG> had taken place earlier It is stated that a proposal for modification of the sanctioned scheme has been made to <ORG> about a year ago It is submitted by the Petitioners that this application for sanction of the <ORG> to such modifications was made in view of the direction of <ORG> dated th September Let the scheme as sanctioned by <ORG> be implemented a <ORG> SM <ORG> SM <ORG> SM <ORG> MN and <ORG> are clearly contrary to the sanctioned BIFR Scheme and both the orders of <ORG> dated th May and th September The said observations were made while entertaining an application filed on behalf of the workmen and not for any other purpose The observations were not made for the purpose of determination of any of the issues involved in the matter Any observation made in a judgment it is trite should not be read in isolation and out of context It has nothing to do with the town planning or development scheme or maintenance of ecological balance <ORG> was not concerned with the interpretation of DCR and thus only because this <ORG> in its aforementioned orders dated and had referred thereto the same would not mean that thereby any direction was issued either directly or indirectly that the sale of the lands pertaining to cotton textile mills must strictly be conducted in accordance with the said scheme This <ORG> as would appear from the submissions made by the counsel for the parties therein merely intended to give effect to the consensus arrived at the bar that an undertaking by the <ORG> to the effect that the order of this High <ORG> would be complied with by way of adjustment of lands from other mills would subserve the interest of justice For the purpose of giving effect to the scheme framed by the <ORG> indisputably <ORG> was constituted to discharge the functions of overseeing the sale of surplus assets of the said mills Yet again it is evident that for the purpose of valuation only they had referred to DCR which also goes to show that they had only in mind the Regulations and not the Regulations Our attention has also been drawn to the fact that there is nothing to show that the <ORG> scheme provided that the lands were to be surrendered to <ORG> and <ORG> from each of the mills and not out of the land of some other mill The order of this Court dated had thus been given effect to Even there does not exist any material to show that at any point of time they had approached <ORG> in judicial review Despite the fact that ordinarily a sale can be set aside only in terms of Rules and of Order XXI of Code of Civil Procedure it was opined that the court is bound to confirm the sale and direct grant of a certificate vesting the title in the purchaser as from the date of sale when no application in term of Rule was made or when such application was made and disallowed We are not oblivious of the fact that the decisions referred to hereinbefore have no direct application in the instant case as the sale of <ORG> mill lands were not effected in execution of decrees passed by a competent court of law but we have referred thereto only to highlight that having regard to the principles analogous to the ratio laid down in the aforementioned decisions the court should make an endeaour to safeguard the interest of the bona fide purchasers unless and until there exists any statutory interdict <NAME> AND LACHES Each one of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants had advanced lengthy submissions in regard to the irretrievable injuries caused to their respective clients by reason of delay and laches on the part of the writ petitioners in filing the writ petition The writ petitioners filed a writ petition before <ORG> questioning the validity of DCR which was dismissed Requisite statutory sanctions had been obtained in most of the cases Schemes were submitted by them in terms of the extant regulations Even on the writ petitioners filed an affidavit and in paragraph thereof it was categorically averred that the <ORG> Scheme had no bearing on the validity of the rule On th May this Court set aside the interim order passed by <ORG> whereafter an advertisement was issued by <ORG> The purchasers indisputably borrowed a huge amount from banks financial institutions and they are required to pay interest on the said borrowed sums This <ORG> in a large number of decisions has categorically laid down that where by reason of delay and or laches on the part of the writ petitioners the parties altered their positions and or third parties interests have been created public interest litigations may be summarily dismissed It was further stated There is no doubt that delay is a very important factor while exercising extraordinary jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution We have no doubt in our mind that the writ petitioners are guilty of serious delay and laches on their part It was not a case where during the interregnum the parties altered their position and third party interest was created It is in that situation this <ORG> observed that if a rule made by a rule making authority is found to be outside the scope of its power it is void and it is not at all relevant that its validity has not been questioned for a long period of time if a rule is void it remains void whether it has been acquiesced in or not It had calamitous consequence to the entrepreneurs who are required to pay lakhs and lakhs of rupees by way of interest to the banks and other financial institutions per day As we have considered the matter on merits evidently we are not dismissing the writ petition on the ground of delay and laches alone but we have taken the same as one of the factors in determining the questions raised before us It further argues that if the judgment of <ORG> is implemented it would cause irretrievable injury and extreme prejudice to the workers Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> on the other hand not only laid emphasis on the so called defaults of the mill owners but had gone to the extent of urging that the workers dues have not been paid substantively The workers dues being to the extent of crores the same are in excess of the legal dues of the workers and only a paltry sum had been paid to them whereas the dues of the banks had been cleared We may however place on record that according to Mr <NAME> the statement of Mr <NAME> that nothing had been paid to the workers is baseless and irresponsible vi Sale of NTC mills was not contrary to the BIFR Scheme as also the orders passed by this Court vii Although delay and laches play an important role as we have considered the merit of the matter the writ petition filed by the Respondent Nos and is not being dismissed on that ground alone viii It is not necessary for us to go into the question as to whether worker dues have been paid and also as to whether the committee had been applying the fund in terms of DCR or not
