Whether there were materials to justify the assessment of Rs as income of the assessee from undisclosed source in respect of the assessment year So far as the first question is concerned no argument was addressed to us by the learned counsel for the assessee We have examined the order of the income tax authorities and <ORG> for ourselves and apart from the concession made by the assessees counsel we also cannot find any ground to invalidate the proceedings under section Accordingly we answer the first question in the affirmative The assessee was examined by <ORG> on August in which he admitted that the money belonged to him and that he had advanced the same as a loan to Mr <NAME> but that he did not maintain any account books or record to show how and wherefrom the said sum of Rs There were no entries relating to the advance of Rs In due course the Income tax Officer on January issued a notice to the assessee under section and by another notice under section dated June required the assessee to explain the nature and the source of the said amount The assessee furnished a reply to the said notice on August alleging that the source of the amount in question was the privy purse of his grandmother and his mother and also the income of his estate was kept intact and on the death of his mother in the assessee came into possession of the same which according to him amounted to Rs The assessee also relied on past income amounting to Rs The Appellate Assistant Commissioner also relied upon the fact that it was improbable that the two ladies had kept such a large amount of money intact and further on the circumstance that there were numerous female issues of the grandmother of the assessee and the assessees mother had also daughters and another son and these female issues were married to commoners and as such it was not possible to believe that all the money of the two ladies was allowed to devolve on the assessee alone He further observed that during the war fortunes were made by people in business and in speculation and Isphani being a particular friend of the assessee and being in business on a large scale it is possible that the assessee may have earned the amount of Rs and held that for this reason also it could not be believed that he had in his hands a large sum of money as a balance out of the alleged amount of Rs The <ORG> also observed that the assessee had admittedly accounts in a large number of banks and it was unbelievable that a person having accounts in several banks and thus knowing the value and the worth of money would keep a huge sum of money like Rs They also held that the entry in the accounts being only six days before the close of the accounting year relevant to the assessment year and having regard to the status and the position of the assessee and the large funds at his disposal for earning income and his potential capacity to earn income it was rightly included in the income of that year and was assessable in that year In the result they dismissed the appeal There were numerous solid facts which have been pointed out above viz that there was no entry about the advance of Rs It was also surprising that neither the ladies nor the assessee after he had received the amount should have deposited it in banks when admittedly he had accounts in a large number of banks Lastly there was the fact that the assessee asked for instalments for payment of a comparatively small amount of Rs If his case were to be believed he had nearly lakhs of rupees in his hands out of the savings themselves not taking into account over lakhs of rupees which he alleged to be his own savings Having regard to all the facts and circumstances of this case it appears to us that the case falls within the rule laid down in the last of the cases mentioned above
