PETITIONER MORGAN STANLEY MUTUAL FUND Vs RESPONDENT KARTICK DAS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> VENKATACHALLIAH CJ ANAND A CITATION SCC JT SCALE ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Leave granted Upon receipt of such approval for the scheme the appellant and the Investment Manager took necessary steps to begin marketing the scheme by issue of advertisements There are several irregularities in the same The following order was passed on by <ORG> Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Petitioner files the complaint today Accordingly we direct <ORG> and OP and its men agents collecting banks not to proceed any further with the issue of crores Morgan Stanley Growth Fund Units due to be opened on till proper clarification is made in its prospectus and with the leave of this learned Forum No member of the public has a right or entitlement to a share of the company making an issue of capital for the first time Thus <ORG> has no jurisdiction whatsoever to deal with this case The principles relating to grant of injunction including the balance of convenience have not been borne in mind Even assuming that the <ORG> is conferred with the power to grant injunction it has not examined whether there were overwhelming reasons for urgency and why the grievance could not have been made earlier There is also suppression of material facts on the part of the respondent In matters of this kind there must be an undertaking as to the damages on the part of the party seeking the injunction In this case since the appellant has suffered very much in that not even the copy of the injunction was served on the appellant which copy came to be obtained only through the bankers it is a fit case in which the appellant should be compensated with exemplary costs Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the respondent urges that there are well known principles for the grant of ex parte injunction Should the court be satisfied that there is a prima facie case on balance of convenience it can always grant There were important points raised in the writ petition There is contravention of Sections and of the Companies Act We have already extracted the impugned order In order to decide these questions it will be necessary to set out the factual matrix It came into force on as stated in Section of the <ORG> Act The <ORG> examines the scheme and suggests modifications if any and allows the scheme to be advertised and published It is after this the appellant took the necessary steps and began marketing the scheme by issuing advertisements in the press holding presentations with brokers etc There is also a challenge to the method of allotment However <ORG> reserves the right to accept or reject any subscriptions including subscriptions in excess of the targeted amount Accordingly <ORG> reserves the right to accept or reject any subscription including accepting subscription in excess of the targeted amount ii that there is a minimum period for which the issue will be kept open namely days iii that those who apply for the units before the closure of the issue would have the same priority and would be allotted units to the extent applied for iv that there is a provision for a closure notice which provision has been discussed with and examined by <ORG> In this factual background we will take up the questions set out for determination The definition of consumer is contained under Section of the Act which reads as under consumer means any person who i buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised or under any system of deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of such person but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose or ii hires any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services other than the person who hires the services for consideration paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised or under any system of deferred payment when such services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person As per the definition consumer is tile one who purchases goods for private use or Consumption He needs protection from the manufacturer producer supplier wholesaler and retailer Till the allotment of shares takes place the shares do not exist But the title to get on the register consists in the possession of a certificate together with a transfer signed by the registered holder He had the certificates and AIR PC IA Bom LR blank transfers signed by the registered holders It would be an upset of all <ORG> transactions if it were suggested that a broker who sold shares by general description did not implement his bargain by supplying the buyer with the certificate and blank transfers signed by the registered holders of the shares described He could sell no more He sold what in England would have been choses in action and he delivered choses in action Hence equitable considerations not applicable to goods do not apply to shares in India In other words before allotment of shares whether the applicant for such shares could be called a consumer while defining shares this Court observed A share is not a sum of money it represents an interest measured by a sum of money and made up of diverse rights contained in the contract evidenced by the articles of association of the Company What is that he could complain of under the Act This takes us to the definition of complaint under Section which reads as follows The expression unfair trade practice as per rules shall have the same meaning as defined under Section A of Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act Does <ORG> have jurisdiction in matters of this kind In view of our answers to Questions and it follows that <ORG> has no jurisdiction whatsoever the court will also consider the time at which the plaintiff first had notice of the act complained so that the making of improper order against a party in his absence is prevented the court will consider whether the plaintiff had acquiesced for sometime and in such circumstances it will not grant ex parte injunction the court would expect a party applying for ex parte injunction to show utmost good faith in making the application paras No injunction could be granted under Order Rules and of the Code unless the plaintiffs establish that they had a prima facie case meaning thereby that there was a bona fide contention between the parties or a serious question to be tried The question that must necessarily arise is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case there is a prima facie case and if so as between whom In view of the legal principles applicable it is difficult for us to say on tile material on record that the plaintiffs have a prima facie case Even if there was a serious question to be tiled <ORG> had to consider the balance of convenience We have no doubt that there is no reason to prevent the appellant from recalling the amount of Rs This Court had occasion to emphasise the need to give reasons before passing ex parte orders of injunction paras the court shall record the reasons why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case In this background the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality This requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to a suit who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed The party which invokes the Jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restrain against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the court or the authority concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them In respect of some of such provisions it has been held that they are required to be complied with but non compliance therewith will not vitiate the order so passed But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule of Order Such ex parte orders have far reaching effect as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all As such whenever a court considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of injunction without notice to other side it must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration while passing an order of injunction all relevant factors including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed As to why the respondent chose to come at the eleventh hour and where was the need to pass an urgent order of injunction are matters which are not discernible Besides tested in the light of the case law set out above the impugned order which is bereft of reason and laconic cannot stand a moment scrutiny Though in this case we have come to the conclusion that <ORG> will have no power to grant injunction yet in general cases it becomes necessary to evolve certain venue restrictions Like an individual or a firm a company can for the purposes of the Rules of the Supreme Court carry on business in more places than one Courts outside the place where the registered office is located if approached must have regard to the following Could injunction be granted even without notice to the respondent which will cause immense hardship and administrative inconvenience Therefore the court must ensure that the plaintiff comes to court well in time so that notice may be served on the defendant and he may have his say before any interim order is passed The said section reads as under If after the proceeding conducted under Section <ORG> is satisfied that the goods complained against suffer from any of the defects specified in the complaint or that any of the allegations contained in the complaint about the services are proved it shall issue an order to the opposite party directing him to take one or more of the following things namely a to remove the defect pointed out by the appropriate laboratory from the goods in question to replace the goods with new goods of similar description which shall be free from any defect to return to the complainant the price or as the case may be the charges paid by the complainant to pay such amount as may be awarded by it as compensation to the consumer for any loss or injury suffered by the consumer due to the negligence of the opposite party Every order made by <ORG> under sub section shall be signed by all the members constituting it and if there is any difference of opinion the order of the majority of the members constituting it shall be the order of <ORG> A careful reading of the above discloses that there is no power under the Act to grant any interim relief of sic or even an ad interim relief If the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to grant relief is confined to the four clauses mentioned under Section it passes our comprehension as to how an interim injunction could ever be granted disregarding even the balance of convenience Therefore we hold that the grounds urged by the respondent seeking to support the impugned order are untenable There is an increasing tendency on the part of litigants to indulge in speculative and vexatious litigation and adventurism which the for a seem readily to oblige
