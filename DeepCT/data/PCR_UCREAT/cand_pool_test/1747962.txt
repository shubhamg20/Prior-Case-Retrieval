At every step of the reasoning in support of either view taken on it there is considerable divergence of judicial authority There is much to be said for either view and ultimately our decision must depend upon what view appeals to us The question is Is Section Civil controlled by Section of the Indian Limitation Act or does it prescribe an absolute prohibition of an entertainment of a fresh execution application beyond twelve years from the date of the decree subject only to the exceptions contained in that same section Section runs as follows Where an application to execute a decree not being a decree granting an injunction has been made no order for the execution of the same decree shall be made upon any fresh application presented after the expiration of years from a the date of the decree sought to be executed or where the decree or any subsequent order directs any payment of money or the delivery of any property to be made at a certain date or at recurring periods the date of the default in making the payment or delivery in respect of which the applicant seeks to execute the decree Nothing in this section shall be deemed a to preclude the <ORG> from ordering the execution of a decree upon an application presented after the expiration of the said term of twelve years where the judgment debtor has by fraud or force prevented the execution of the decree at some time within years immediately before the date of the application or to limit or otherwise affect the operation of Article of the First Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act Section of the Indian Limitation Act in EO far as it is material is in the following terms In computing the period of limitation prescribed for any suit or application for the execution of a decree the institution or execution of which has been stayed by injunction or order the time of the continuance of the injunction or order the day on which it was issued or made and the day on which it was withdrawn shall be excluded The Legislative history of this provision is as follows In the Act of there was no provision corresponding to this In the next Act of the corresponding provision was Section which ran thus In computing the period of limitation prescribed for any suit the institution of which has been stayed by injunction or order the time of the continuance of the injunction or order the day on which it was issued or made and the day on which it was withdrawn shall be excluded Another statutory provision to which it is necessary to refer is Section of the Limitation Act as it now stands after the amendment in which runs thus Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Section Sections to and Section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law The corresponding provision before the amendment was as follows Nothing in this Act shall affect or alter any period of limitation specifically prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India The Limitation Act of Section was more or less in similar terms namely Where by any special or local law or hereafter in force in British India a period of limitation is specially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed According to him Section has nothing to do with the periods of limitation prescribed in the schedule to the Limitation Act He dismissed Section of the Limitation Act as not affecting the matter one way or the other because it related to special or local laws which contain special provisions of their own for the limitation of certain proceedings taken to obtain reliefs provided therein and did not include the Civil Procedure Code in its scope The period in Section Civil was not a period of limitation in the strict sense for an application for execution of a decree of the kind mentioned in Section will in general not be in time if filed within years of Article which speaks of the execution of a decree or order of <ORG> not provided for in Article or by Section Civil and the first column in Article which runs thus Application for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in this schedule or by Section Civil the learned Judge expressed his opinion that it was in the looser sense the phrase period of limitation was there used He was well aware that there was no conclusive reason in support of this view because he said On this question one has to find the sense in which it is used as best as he can came to the same conclusion as the learned Judges in <NAME> <NAME> Mad but apparently on the ground that Section of the Limitation Act applies only to the periods prescribed in the schedule to that Act and does not apply to the periods mentioned in Section Civil This was the ground on which <NAME> based his decision though <NAME> was of a contrary view No other decision of this Court was brought to our notice which deals directly with Section of the Limitation Act in its application to Section of the Code The learned Judges held that the benefit of this provision would enure to a decree holder even in the computation of the period of time limited by Section <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Bench discussed at length the question What is and what is not a period of limitation He said If the law fixes a period of time after which a suit or other proceeding is not to be entertained by the <ORG> the period so limited is etymologically a period of limitation There is one statement in <NAME> judgment which appears to me to be not quite correct In Allahabad the question was very elaborately discussed by a Full Bench in Drigpal Singh Pancham Singh ILR All FB The decision of the Full Bench was that the provisions of Section of the Limitation Act applied to and affected Section The learned Judges held that the word prescribed has been used in Section of the Limitation Act in a general sense as meaning prescribed by any enactment for the time being in force and that Section does prescribe a period of limitation The first schedule of the Limitation Act is not the only statutory provision which prescribes a period of limitation does not appear that there is any justification judicial authority apart for restricting the operation of the section to the periods of limitation prescribed by the Act or by the First Schedule Having regard to the language used by the <ORG> in Articles to and to the heading of Section namely Limit of time for execution it appeared to be clear to him that Section of the Code does prescribe a period of limitation His definition of a period of limitation is as follows It appears to me that if the result of a statutory provision is in substance to fix a period within which a person must take appropriate and necessary action If he desires to assert his rights in a Court of law that provision prescribes a period of limitation The learned Judge gives additional reasons of holding that the word prescribed in Section of the Limitation Act is used in a general sense as meaning prescribed by any law whatsoever In addition to these reasons the learned Judge points out that to hold that Section is not subject to the rules laid down by Section of the Limitation Act would lead to starting results Referring to the view of <NAME> that the period prescribed by Section was not strictly a period of limitation he said I must confess that I cannot see that there is much difference between an enactment which forbids execution upon a decree more than years old and one prescribing a maximum period of limitation of years In addition to the reasons given by the learned Judges in Drigpal Singh <NAME> ILR All they gave another reason based on Section of the Limitation Act In their view any enactment which prescribed a period of limitation for any suit appeal or application was a special law with reference to the Limitation Act which embodied the general law regarding limitation The Civil Procedure Code was a general law in matters of civil procedure but in so far as it prescribed a period of limitation it was a special law regarding limitation There is no discussion and the other learned Judge merely agreed with him The Limitation Act did not provide the periods for several applications for which subsequent Limitation Act provided by the Articles in the schedule Section corresponds to the present Section Section to Section and Section to Section Section provided a period of years for enforcement of the judgment decree or order of a <ORG> established by Royal Charter and for reviver and enlargement of time by payment or acknowledgment Section dealt with other judgments decrees and orders and ran thus No process of execution shall issue from any <ORG> not established by Royal Charter to enforce any judgment decree or order of such <ORG> unless some proceeding shall have been taken to enforce such judgment decree or order or to keep the same in force within three years next preceding the application for such execution The Limitation Act did not provide any periods of limitation for several applications under the Civil Procedure Code Nor did it provide for appeals and review To give a few illustrations Section provided for a period of thirty days for an application to set aside an ex parte decree Under Section a period of one year was prescribed for a suit to establish a right negatived in claim proceedings Under Section the period of limitation for an application to set aside an execution sale on the ground of any material irregularity in publishing or conducting the sale was days from the date of sale It followed that if there was a general provision In the Limitation Act it would govern also provisions as to limitation contained in the Civil Procedure Code The question which arose for decision was whether this provision was subject to be modified by Sections and of the Limitation Act There is no provision in the Code of corresponding to the present Section There was no provision corresponding to Section of the present Limitation Act either It not only provided for the limitation of suits it also provided for appeals and certain applications to <ORG> which had been provided in the Civil Procedure Code of It was in this Act for the first time we find a provision corresponding to the present Section It is in the Code of this year that a provision corresponding to the present Section of the Code makes its first appearance in Section That section in so far as it is material ran as follows Where an application to execute a decree for the payment of money or delivery of other property has been made under this section and granted no subsequent application to execute the same decree shall be granted unless the <ORG> is satisfied that on the last preceding application due diligence was used to procure complete satisfaction of the decree and the order of the <ORG> granting any such subsequent application shall be conclusive evidence that due diligence was used to procure such satisfaction And no such subsequent application shall be granted after the expiration of twelve years from any of the following dates namely a the date of the decree sought to be enforced or of the decree if any on appeal affirming the same or where the decree or any subsequent order directs the payment of money or the delivery of property by instalments the date of the default in paying or delivering the instalment in respect of which the applicant seeks to enforce the decree fixing a period of limitation that there were consequential changes in the second schedule of the Limitation Act The corresponding provisions in these two enactments do not contain many radical changes though there are some changes For instance while the old Section of the Code of and of applied only to decrees for payment of money or delivery of other property the present Section is made applicable to all decrees of any kind whatever except decrees granting injunction In the Limitation Act Section has been expresssly made applicable to an application for the execution or a decree it appears to me from the course of legislation to which I have adverted above that the provisions of the Limitation Act must be read with those provisions of the Civil procedure Code which are intimately connected therewith There is no doubt room or comment in the fact that while other provisions prescribing periods of limitation for applications appeals and suite found in the Civil Procedure Code of are subsequently transferred to the Limitation Act the provision corresponding to Section of the Code namely Section of the Code of continued to remain in the Code and It was contended before us that Section of the Limitation Act as it now stands after the amendment by Act of might help us to come to the conclusion that Section controls Section of the Code The special law contemplated is the law which gives rise to special causes of action and which itself provides for the method of enforcement of rights conferred by that Act or for repress of injuries suffered by the application of the provisions of that Act It is a general law relating to procedure I am definitely of opinion that Section has no bearing on the question referred to us Whether the word prescribed in Section would apply to periods of limitation provided by other statutes or not it is clearly indicated by Article that the period fixed by Section is in pari materia with the periods of limitation provided in the schedule to the Limitation Act The period of years mentioned in Section of the Code is a period of limitation <NAME> was inclined to hold that in the strict sense a rule of limitation implies that if an action is brought or an application is made within the time prescribed it will not be barred Applying this test he considered the rule laid down in Section of the Code would not be a rule of limitation in the strict sense because even if an application for execution is made within the period fixed by that section the application may be nevertheless barred unless it is within three years from any of the dates mentioned in the third column of Article Even so I do not see any anomaly If by an act of <ORG> over which the decree holder has not control he is prevented from recovering the fruits his decree during the full period of twelve years It appears to me to be highly unreasonable that by the mere lapse of twelve years from the date of the decree his rights should become extinct rights which he was prevented from enforcing for a part at least of the period of twelve years Will an acknowledgment in writing before the expiry of the period prescribed by Section of the Code furnish a fresh period of twelve years from the date of the acknowledgment If the expression prescribed in that section means prescribed not only in the schedule but also prescribed by Section of the Code then it may be contended that an acknowledgment will have that effect
