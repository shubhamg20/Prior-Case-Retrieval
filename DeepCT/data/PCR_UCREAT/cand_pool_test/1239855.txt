It is not necessary to narrate all the allegations made in the affidavit the counter affidavit the supplementary affidavit and the rejoinder affidavit filed in this case per square yard whereas compensation had been awarded to the petitioners at the rate of Rs per square yard only and further that no evidence had been produced on behalf of the respondent No which could have thrown any light on the value of the petitioners land which was sought to be acquired The only two questions that require consideration in this case are firstly whether after having given his award but before it was filed under Section of the Act it was open to the Land Acquisition Officer to review or revise the earlier award and substitute it by a completely fresh one and secondly whether he could do so on the instructions of the Land Reforms Commissioner or at the request of the Secretary Learned counsel for the parties have stated that no other question is involved in the case Under the provisions of Section the Collector has been given the power to require any person to make or deliver to him at any time and place a statement containing so far as may be practicable the names of every other person possessing any interest in the land or any part thereof as co proprietor sub proprietor mortgagee tenant or otherwise and of the nature of such interest and of the rents and profits if any received or receivable on account thereof for three years next preceding the date of the statement After the Collector has issued notices under Section and also if asked for received the statements and the names as contemplated by Section he has to make an enquiry under Section of the Act Award of Collector when to be final Such award shall be filed in the Collector office and shall except as hereinafter provided be final and conclusive evidence as between the Col lector and the persons interested whether they have respectively appeared before the Collector or not of the true area and value of the land and the apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested The Collector shall give immediate notice of his award to such of the persons interested as are not present personally or by their representatives when the award is made Even if they were judicial by now it has been held in several decided cases that they are not there would be no bar to the Land Acquisition Officer tearing out or destroying an award which he had written out and signed Such a view was taken by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> Asstt AIR SC was called upon to decide as to whether an opinion written out on behalf of a Bench of this Court and signed by one of the Judges constituting the Bench could be validly pronounced after he had died by the other learned Judge who constituted the Bench In the present case it cannot be said that the Land Acquisition Officer had not given the touch of finality to his award made earlier because not only he wrote it out and signed it but he also issued a notice calling upon the respondent No to deposit a sum of Rs To my mind in these circumstances he has no power left to change the award There is a difference between the writing out and signing of an award and making an award On the facts of the present case I am satisfied that the earlier award had been made under Section It is true that in connection with Section of the Act there is some conflict of opinion as to when an award would be deemed to have been made The expression Collector means the Collector of a district and includes a Deputy Commissioner and any officer specifically appointed by the appropriate Government to perform the functions of a Collector under this Act Learned counsel has placed reliance upon the definition of the word Collector occuring in the General Clauses Act The next point that requires consideration is whether the second award given by the Land Acquisition Officer was at his own instance or under the pressure or advice of the Land Reforms Commissioner without any conviction of his own and the only thing he had to say in regard to the various grounds mentioned in the letters dated st November and th June was that they appeared to him to be not at all satisfactory had been dealing with the same he could have by all means given in the assessment order which he made his reasons for doing so and these reasons would have been open to scrutiny in further proceedings taken by the appellants either by way of appeal or otherwise It has been contended by Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondent No that the subsequent award of the Land Acquisition Officer would show that he had applied his own mind to the facts of the case and even though a suggestion had been received from the Land Reforms Commissioner the Land Acquisition I have already mentioned above that not only he wrote out and signed his first award and further sent notices to the respondent No and the Land Reforms Commissioner but also replied back to the Land Reforms Commissioner that his award was a correct one and he had no reason to change it It is only later on when pressure was brought upon him that he changed his mind Considering the circumstances of this case I have no hesitation in rejecting the suggestion that the subsequent award was made by the Land Acquisition Officer exercising his own judgment without having been dictated to by the Land Reforms Commissioner There is no provision in the Act under which he could have issued directions to the Land Acquisition Officer to change his award
