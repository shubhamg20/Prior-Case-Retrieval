The Subordinate Judge came to the conclusion after a careful consideration of both the oral and documentary evidence and after noting the demeanour of the witnesses examined before him for either party that the appellant case was true and that the consideration was not that stated in the bond but it was that the respondent should not assist <NAME> in the litigation which was then going on between the latter and the appellant Before we deal with the questions thus raised before us in second appeal we must observe that where a <ORG> of first instance has upon the evidence of witnesses examined before it come to a conclusion of fact the <ORG> of appeal ought not to disturb that finding unless it is satisfied that the lower <ORG> had either omitted to consider material evidence or some cardinal fact or had given undue weight to some evidence or fact which is of little or no importance If Exhibit was passed for the purpose of showing that the consideration stated in the bond in suit was not real but that the consideration was different Section has no application and it is admissible in evidence That no doubt is a finding of fact and under ordinary circumstances we s<NAME>uld have accepted it as a finding binding upon us in second appeal but the finding of the learned Judge that Exhibit is a suspicious document appears to have been influenced by his view as to its admissibility There was the undisputed fact apparent upon the record that whereas the defendant had affirmed on oath that the plaintiff had executed Exhibit the plaintiff did not go into the witness box and contradict the defendant sworn testimony that he produced no accounts alt<NAME>ugh he had on a previous occasion admitted that he had accounts and that there was no cross examination of the defendant witnesses so far as they swore that the plaintiff had executed Exhibit That is for the <ORG> which has to appreciate the evidence Further it is admitted that <NAME> is plaintiff gumasta and that he managed the present suit for the plaintiff He swore that the plaintiff had executed Exhibit and there was no attempt made for the plaintiff to cross examine his evidence on that point We think then that there are three substantial errors of law in the judgment of the learned Joint Judge which vitiate his finding of fact We must therefore send the case back to him for a re hearing of the appeal upon the following points which arise for determination Did the plaintiff execute the document Exhibit If the first point is found in the affirmative has the plaintiff performed his part of that agreement
