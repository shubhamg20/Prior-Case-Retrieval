Vs RESPONDENT <NAME> NAG DATE OF JUDGMENT BENC<ORG> <NAME> BENC<ORG> <NAME> WANC<ORG>OO MITTER CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC ACT Code of Civil Procedure Act of ss <ORG> mistakenly passing preliminary decree for sale in suit for foreclosure Subsequently correcting mistake and passing final decree for foreclosure Power to correct such error Subsequently the mortgagor sold his interest to <ORG> The respondent thereupon filed an application under for restoration of possession to him <ORG>is appeal was entertained and the <ORG>igh <ORG> set aside the trial court decree on the ground that there was lack of conformity between the preliminary decree which was for sale and the final decree which was for foreclosure The matter was remanded to the trial court and leave was given to the respondent to participate in the matter A ii There is an inherent power in the court which passes the judgment to correct a clerical mistake or an error arising from an accidental slip or omission and to vary its judgment so as to give effect to its meaning and intention On the facts of the present case there could be little doubt that the court had no occasion to pass a preliminary decree for sale and that it was through an accidental slip or inadvertence that in the penultimate part of its judgment the court used the phraseology proper in a mortgage decree for sale This being the position the trial court had the power under and of the Code of Civil procedure to correct its own error which had crept in the judgment and the preliminary decree and to pass a proper final decree for foreclosure as intended by it iv The principle of lis pendens applies even to involuntary alienations like court sales The plaint also contained a prayer that on failure to pay the decreetal amount within the time fixed by the court the right of the defendants to redeem the mortgage may be annulled and a decree may be passed giving possession of the mortgaged property <ORG> directed notices to be issued on the defendants that is the said two mortgagors and the said <NAME> and they having raised no objection the court by an order dated January ordered substitution and then passed a final decree The said decree after reciting that the said decretal amount was not paid within the time appointed by the defendants or any other person entitled to redeem the said mortgage provided as follows And it is hereby ordered and declared that the defendant and all persons claiming through or under him are absolutely debarred and foreclosed of and from all rights of redemption of and in the property in the aforesaid preliminary decree mentioned and that the defendant shall deliver to the plaintiff quiet and peaceful possession of the said mortgaged property On August the respondent filed a second application under section of the Code for setting aside the said final decree It is this disconformity between the preliminary decree and the final decree which is being challenged by the appellant It is manifest that <ORG> judgment meant that the respondent had sufficient interest to maintain the said appeal and participate in the proceedings before <ORG> on the said remand for considering the question whether the said preliminary decree should be altered or not and if not whether the respondent had still the right to redeem the said mortgage though the time for payment fixed under the said preliminary decree had expired that is six months from December long before the respondent became a purchaser of part of the said equity of redemption on February There is no dispute that the valuation test for a certificate is satisfied in the present case <ORG> was bound to allow him to participate in those proceedings as <ORG> judgment specifically directed it to deal with the case in accordance with the directions contained in the said judgment maintain that the question of redemption was still open and he had the right to redeem the mortgaged property Counsel for the respondent however contended that the certi ficate granted by <ORG> was not competent and was liable to be vacated as the judgment passed by <ORG> was not a judgment decree or final order inasmuch as what <ORG> had done was only to remand the case to <ORG> and <ORG> had yet to decide the question whether a final decree for foreclosure should be passed or whether the final decree should be one for sale enabling the respondent to redeem the said mortgage <ORG> has given its judgment and in pursuance thereof passed a decree setting aside the said final decree If <ORG> had held that the respondent in the circumstances of the case had no right to maintain his appeal the final decree would have become a concluded decree and his right of redemption if any would have been totally extinguished The respondent filed his appeal against the said final decree and two questions arise in that appeal whether being a purchaser pendente lite he had locus standi to file an appeal and challenge the final decree and whether <ORG> had jurisdiction to pass the final decree which was not in conformity with the preliminary decree There can be no question that the two questions raised in the appeal before <ORG> were disposed of finally inasmuch as the said final decree was set aside as not being valid and binding on the respondent and the question of redemption by him which was extinguished by that final decree was reopened entitling the respondent to contend that he had the right to redeem and to hold the said property the preliminary decree was for sale and whether the respondent had the right to contend that he was entitled to redeem the said mortgage in view of the fact that he was the execution purchaser of part of the equity of redemption pendente lite Now it is well settled that there is an inherent power in the court which passed the judgment to correct a clerical mistake or an error arising from an accidental slip or omission and to vary its judgment so as to give effect to its meaning and intention An order even when passed and entered may be amended by the court so as to carry out its intention and express the meaning of the court when the order was made This court held that the use of the words mesne profits in the context was obviously the result of inadvertence in view of the fact that the decree of <ORG> had specifically used the words net profits and therefore the decretal order drawn up in <ORG> through mistake could be corrected under sections and of the Code even after <ORG> had granted certificate and appeals were admitted in this court before the date of the Ch The Rule does not also affect the court inherent power under section There can therefore be little doubt that the court had no occasion to pass a preliminary decree for sale and that it was through an accidental slip or inadvertence that in the penultimate part of its judgment the court used the phraseology proper in a mortgage decree for sale That order states that the Subordinate Judge who tried the suit through oversight passed a preliminary decree for sale overlooking the fact that it was a suit for foreclosure and possession that it was also apparent that this mistake of <ORG> went unnoticed in <ORG> which confirmed the decree of <ORG> and therefore this court when it passed the final decree being apprised of the apparent mistake in the form of the preliminary decree corrected the initial mistake and did justice by passing a final decree for foreclosure and for possession which was the only scope of this suit Mr <NAME> however raised two contentions that a judgment or decree cannot be varied when it correctly represents what the court decided though it may be wrongly nor can the operative or substantive part of the judgment be varied and a different one substituted and that a judgment or decree cannot be varied where there has been intervention of rights of third parties based on the existence of the decree and ignorance of the mistake therein Therefore there is no question of a wrong judgment having been passed by the Judge or the preliminary decree correctly representing that which was wrongly decided by the Judge The second contention is based on the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Harris where he stated that there may possibly be cases in which an application to correct an error of this description would be too late That being the position it is difficult to see how the case of <NAME> <NAME> can apply to the present case In this view <ORG> had the power to correct the accidental slip which had crept in its judgment and correct that error by passing the final decree in accordance with its true intention In our view both the contentions raised by the respondent in this behalf must be rejected What then is the position of the respondent once it is held that the final decree for foreclosure was validly passed by <ORG> Could he challenge that decree in an appeal against it in <ORG> on the basis that he was entitled to redeem the said mortgage Section of the Transfer of Property Act provides that besides the mortgagor any person other than the mortgagee who has any interest in or charge upon the property mortgaged or in or upon the right to redeem the same may redeem or institute a suit for redemption of such mortgaged property other party thereto under any decree or order which may be made therein except under the authority of the court and on such terms as it may impose Under the Explanation to that section the pendency of such a suit commences from the date of its institution and continues until it is disposed of by a final decree or order and complete satisfaction or discharge of such a decree or order has been obtained The purchaser pendente lite under this doctrine is bound by the result of the litigation on the principle that since the result must bind the party to it so must it bind the person deriving his right title and interest from or through him it is true that section strictly speaking does not apply to involuntary alienations such as court sales but it is well established that the principle of lis pendens applies to such alienations It follows that the respondent having purchased from the said <NAME> while the appeal by the said <NAME> against the said preliminary decree was pending in <ORG> the doctrine of lis pendens must apply to his purchase and as aforesaid he was bound by the result of that suit In the view we have taken that the final foreclosure decree was competently passed by <ORG> his right to equity of redemption was extinguished by that decree and he had therefore no longer any right to redeem the said mortgage In the result we allow the appeal set aside the judgment and decree passed by <ORG> and restore the judgment and decree passed by <ORG> The respondent will pay the appellants costs all throughout
