The new Rules provided that the post of principal Grade Ii would be filled up by direct recruitment to the extent of per cent and by promotion to the extent of per cent The respondent challenged this order in a Writ Petition filled before <ORG> which was transferred to <ORG> Jabalpur and the <ORG> by its judgment dated allowed the petition with the finding that the requirement of possessing the educational qualification of a Degree or Diploma in Engineering for the post of Principal was applicable only to direct recruitment and not to promotions and as such the respondent who admittedly did neither possess a Degree nor a Diploma in Engineering was still entitled to be promoted as Principal Class II Appointments either by direct requirement or by promotion on the post of Principal Class I or class II as pointed out earlier are made in accordance with the provisions of the Rules promulgated in Rule which deals with appointment to the Service provides as under Recruitment to the service after the commencement of these unless shall be by the following methods namely a By direct recruitment through selection By promotion of the members of the Service as specified in Column of the Schedule IV By transfer of the persons substantively appointed on the specified posts in the specified service Notwithstanding anything contained in sub rule if in the opinion of the <ORG> the exigencies of the service so requires the <ORG> may after obtaining the approval of the <ORG> in <ORG> adopt such method or methods of recruitment to the service other than those specified in the said sub rule as it may by order issued in this behalf prescribe Rule provides for appointment by promotion percent and percent of the vacancies available for promotion in such posts in which the percentage of promotion is or more as specified in the Schedule II shall be reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively who are eligible for promotion in accordance with the provisions of rule The procedure for promotion to the reserved vacancies shall be in accordance with the instruction issued by the <ORG> in <ORG> from time to time subject to the provisions of sub rule the <ORG> shall consider the cases of all those persons who on the first day of January of that year had completed service of such number of years whether in officiating or substantive capacity on the post from which promotion is to be made as specified in column of Schedule IV and are within the zone of consideration in accordance with the provisions of sub rule Provided that the services of the released officers of <ORG> and <ORG> after their appointment in the service shall be counted from the date from which they have been deemed to have been appointed in the service in accordance with the General Administration Deptt The field of selection shall ordinarily be limited to seven times of the number of officers to be included in the select list in respect of posts to be filled on the basis of merit cum seniority and five times the number of officers to be included in the select list in respect of posts to be filled on the basis of seniority cum merit Provided that if required number of suitable officers are not available in the field so determined the field may be enlarged to the extent considered necessary by the committee by mentioning the reasons in writing Rule provides for the preparation of a list of officers found suitable for promotion Since Rule which sets out the conditions of eligibility for promotion specifically refers to Schedule IV for purposes of indicating the number of years of service which should have been completed by the officer concerned in order to be eligible for promotion the relevant provisions of Schedule IV are reproduced below SCHEDULE IV See Rule Name of the Name of the Minimum Name of the Name of the Department Service or experience service or Members of post from for post to the which eligibility which Departmental promotion Promotion promotion is to be is to be Committee made made Man Power The Madhya Planning Pradesh Depart Industrial ment Training Gazetted Service Who have completed years of service would be eligible for promotion to the post of principal Class II Thus the Rules specifically provide for promotion of both the groups namely those who hold the Degree or Diploma in Engineering and those who do not possess this qualification It is not disputed that the respondent was promoted to the post of Principal Class II for a short period of six months or till the availability of candidates duly selected by the commission whichever was earlier There is an offer and acceptance in every case It is true that Art imposes constitutional restorations upon the power of removal granted to the President and the Governor under Art SCR also approved the principles laid down in <NAME> case supra that the legal relationship between the <ORG> and its servants is something entirely different Unless therefore there is a provision in the statutory rules for alteration of status in a particular situation it is not open to any <ORG> employee to claim a status different than that which was conferred upon him at the initial or any subsequent stage of service Applying these principles to the instant case since the respondent admittedly was appointed in an ad hoc capacity he would continue to hold the post in question in that capacity In order to make regular appointment by promotion on that post the eligible candidates were considered and the respondent not possessing the required educational qualification was not found fit or suitable for the post of principal and was consequently directed to the appointed on regular basis as Vice principal as he was found suitable only for that post principally for the reason that he did not possess a Degree or Diploma in Engineering It is next contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that although the respondent does not possess a Degree or Diploma in Engineering he has been working on the post of principal for a long time and since he has acquired sufficient experience on the post he need not in the circumstances be disturbed by reverting him as Vice Principal In dispensing justice to the litigating parties the courts not only go into the merits of the respective cases they also try to balance the equities so as to do complete justice between them We are fully conscious that the respondent had worked on the post in question for quite a long time but it was only in ad hoc capacity The <ORG>s as also the <ORG> have no power to override the mandatory provisions of the Rules on sympathetic consideration that a person though not possessing the essential educational qualifications If the <ORG> in exercise of its executive power has created certain posts it is for it to prescribe the mode of appointment or the qualifications which have to be possessed by the candidates before they are appointed on those posts The respondent having worked in an ad hoc capacity on the post of principal might have gained some administrative experience but the same cannot be treated as equivalent to his knowledge in the field of Engineering Power to relax the Rule vests exclusively in the Governor as provided by Rule For the reasons stated above the appeals are allowed the judgment and order dated passed by <ORG> is set aside and the claim petition of the respondent is dismissed but without any order as to costs
