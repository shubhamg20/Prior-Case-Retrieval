Although seven appeals have been filed in this Court the arguments were addressed by the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No of in the matter of <ORG> <ORG> The appellants filed objections under Section A of the Act opposing the acquisition of their lands on several grounds The objections raised by the appellants were considered by the Land Acquisition Collector <NAME> who by his report dated recommended that the lands of these appellants be exempted from acquisition As a result of the decision taken by <ORG> the lands of only three industrial units namely <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> were exempted from acquisition and the lands of all the present appellants were included in the declaration under Section for acquisition The present appellants challenged the acquisition of their lands by individual writ petitions before <ORG> It was pointed out that on the appellant had purchased land in Village Kundli Tehsil and District Sonepat for establishing a large and medium sector industrial unit for manufacturing of polyster buttons While this matter was under process on a notification under Section of the Act was issued for acquisition of land which included the land of the appellant proposed to be developed for the purpose of setting up an industrial unit The appellant also raised its objections under Section A of the Act All the appellants had raised objections under Section A mainly on the following two grounds a That each of them had been persuaded to gift Kanals Marlas of land to <ORG> Kundli for increasing the width of the passage with an understanding that they will be granted permission to change the user of land Finally it was reported keeping all these things in view the <ORG> may take a suitable action In all other cases including the case of <ORG> Anand Buttons Ltd there were no tangible steps taken for erection of factory building much less had industrial production commenced <ORG> took the view that there was justifiable difference between the cases of <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> Industrial Roller Co <ORG> <ORG> on the one hand and those of the present appellants on the other It also came to the conclusion that the action of the Director of <ORG> Haryana calling upon for comments from <ORG> and the action of <ORG> in considering their comments before taking a final decision for issuance of the notification under Section of the Act was neither vitiated nor illegal This reasoning of <ORG> cannot be faulted for the simple reason that the authority who has to carry out the planned development of the industrial estate is in the best position to judge as to which land can be exempted from the acquisition without jeopardizing the development scheme was not a principled one and that there was no uniform yardstick applied for exemption of the said units from acquisition Even if we assume that the three units who were exempted did not qualify under the standard adopted by <ORG> for exemption at the highest it would make the exemption granted to them vulnerable Even assuming that the exemption granted to the said three units was erroneous and illegal Article does not mandate that the appellants should be granted similar illegal and unjustified relief A party cannot claim that since something wrong has been done in another case direction should be given for doing another wrong It would not be setting a wrong right but would be perpetuating another wrong In such matters there is no discrimination involved The concept of equal treatment on the logic of Article of the Constitution of India in short the Constitution cannot be pressed into service in such cases It does not countenance repetition of a wrong action to bring both wrongs on a par Even if hypothetically it is accepted that a wrong has been committed in some other cases by introducing a concept of negative equality the respondents cannot strengthen their case They have to establish strength of their case on some other basis and not by claiming negative equality As to whether in a given set of circumstances certain land should be exempted from acquisition only for the reason that some construction had been carried out is a matter of policy and not of law If after considering all the circumstances <ORG> has taken the view that exemption of the lands of the appellants would render askew the development scheme of the industrial estate it is not possible for <ORG> or this Court to interfere with the satisfaction of the concerned authorities We see no ground on which the appellants could have maintained that their lands should be exempted from acquisition Even if three of the parties had been wrongly exempted from acquisition that gives no right to the appellants to seek similar relief We find no merit in the appeals which are hereby dismissed
