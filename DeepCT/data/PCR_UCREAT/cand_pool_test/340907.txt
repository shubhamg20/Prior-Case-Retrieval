The suit is resisted by the defendants on the ground that her husband the late proprietor of Dharguli Estate made a gift of these properties to her on th June The estate was again attached under the provisions of the Encumbered Estates Act and the present suit was instituted by the plaintiff on th February The learned Subordinate Judge has had no difficulty in giving effect to this argument but he has held that although the grant was void the defendant was in possession under the void grant for over twelve years and therefore acquired a title by adverse possession Mr <NAME> invites us to consider the effect of Section A Encumbered Estates Act and he contends first that the alienation in question became void only on the death of <NAME> which took place on st February secondly that under Section A not only is the title under the void document void but also the title that has been acquired by lapse of time thirdly he contends that there was in fact no adverse possession but that the possession of the defendant was throughout permissive and lastly he contends that limitation is saved under Section Limitation Act as a result of the petition which was filed to the Commissioner on th March In my opinion there is no merit in any of these arguments In that case the plaintiffs sued to recover possession of certain fields alleging that they purchased the entire bhag from the owner thereof It was found as a fact that the plaintiffs had purchased only a portion of the bhag and it was admitted that the title as based upon the purchase was bad But the plaintiffs relied on the fact that they had been in adverse possession of what was sold to them for over years and they contended that they had acquired a complete title under the provisions of Section Limitation Act It appears however that the Collector under the provisions of Section Bhagdari Act summarily removed the plaintiffs and the whole argument before <ORG> was whether the Collector could exercise the right under Section Bhagdari Act after the plaintiffs had acquired a complete title by lapse of time Having considered the section upon which the defendants relied his Lordship proceeded to say as follows It seems to us from the words of the section that the Collector whenever he shall find any person in possession may pass such order as he has passed in this case and the Statute of Limitation does not prevent his so doing Now there is no similar provision in the Chota Nagpur Encumbered Estates Act and it therefore seems to me that the case upon which Mr <NAME> relies is not applicable to the facts of this case In my opinion it is impossible to argue that a title acquired by lapse of time should under the Chota Nagpur Encumbered Estates Act be regarded as void since as I have already said there is nothing in the Act to suggest that it expressly or by necessary implication abrogates the law of limitation It was then contended that there is in this case no adverse possession since the grantor and the grantee were colluding with each other and since the possession of the grantee must in the circumstances of the case be regarded as permissive It is doubtful whether we have any case of adverse possession to try because it would appear that the case falls within Article Limitation Act which provides for a suit for possession of immovable properties when the plaintiff while in possession of the properties has been dispossessed or has discontinued the possession That your honour may be pleased to pass such other order or orders as may validate the grants and give effect to the intentions of the parties according to law He now applies after seven years for the Commissioner sanction to his alienation so as to make it valid It was contended by Mr <NAME> that whatever may have been the position before there was no pretence on the part of the defendant after th March or at any rate after the order of the Commissioner on th April to hold the property under a claim or colour of title and that therefore her possession after th April must be regarded as a permissive possession I must dismiss this appeal with costs
