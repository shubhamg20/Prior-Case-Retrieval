It is the case of the plaintiff that the trade mark word CEAT is a part of the plaintiff company trading style and is also an invented word and the plaintiff has been selling huge quantities of tyres tubes and other material under the trade mark CEAT and the plaintiff commands good reputation and goodwill in the said name and the sale of such goods runs into crores of rupees in a year and the goods are also exported to various countries under the said trade mark CEAT It was also pleaded that a huge amount has been incurred and is being incurred for carrying out advertisements in respect of the said trade mark CEAT and thus by reason of long and continuous and exclusive use the trade mark CEAT is exclusively associated and identified with the plaintiff company and its goods It was alleged that the defendants by using the trade mark CEAT for its fan belt and belt has caused confusion and is likely to cause confusion amongst the customers that the goods being manufactured and sold by the defendants It was pleaded that the defendants have fraudulently and dishonestly used the said trade mark in respect of fan belt and belt being manufactured and marketed by the defendants with a view to get enriched illegally upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff The defendants have contested that the suit pleading that the plaintiff has no cause of action as the plaintiff is not manufacturing and selling the belt and fan belt and the said goods are totally different in nature and description from the goods being manufactured and sold by the plaintiff It was pleaded that the defendants have been using the said trade mark CEAT for ita belts and fan belts since and that there is no likelihood of any confusion being caused by selling the goods by the defendants by using the trade mark CEAT in any manner to show that the goods belong to the plaintiff It is obvious that if there is no link between two trades or in other words the two trades are not closely correlated and the goods are not analogous a conclusion may be reached in a particular case that the chances of deception are too remote to be taken notice of so it is vehemently argued that the goods being manufactured and sold by the defendants are atleast analogous goods to the goods of the plaintiff and as the goods of the plaintiff and the fan belts and belts are being sold at the same type of shops there is every likelihood for ordinary customers to treat the goods after defendants as those of the plaintiff Counsel for the defendants has on the other hand argued that the bb Its and fan be Ks being manufactured by the defendants cannot be tides analogous or allied goods in respect of the registered trade mark of thier plaintiff nmd there is no likelihood of any customer being misled by the be for india manufacturing and selling the said goods under the trade mark Plaintiff Counsel has placed reliance on a number of judgments but it is not necessary to refer to all of them because each case depends on peculiar facts but the principles which have to be kept in view for deciding an application for grant of injunction in such like cases are very well recognised and they came to be considered by this <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Arbitration Law Reporter The learned Judge has referred to almost all the judgments on the subject in order to decide this case It was found by the <ORG> that the two types of goods were being sold from the same shops and there was every likelihood of confusion being caused amongst the customers in considering the goods of the defendant as goods of the plaintiff Reference was made to a judgment of this Court in Counsel for the plaintiff has drawn my attention to the commentary in the book under the Trade Mark Act by <NAME> at page wherein it is mentioned that this suit ultimately was decreed although interim injunction was refused The judgment was given in view of the facts which came out during the course of trial it cannot be said that any general proposition of law has been laid down which could be of any assistance in deciding the present matter As already discussed by me above it would depend on facts of each case in order to see whether there is possibility of confusion occurring or not by use of same trade mark in respect of goods of different nature and whether the said goods could be deemed to be cognate or al<ORG>d goods or not In the said case the question which arose for decision was whether the registration of trade mark SONY for nail polish is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the minds of customers of cognate goods bearing the same mark The defendant was permitted to have its trade mark registered under the name <ORG> in respect of biscuit and toffees The <ORG> gave the finding that where the defendants dealt in biscuits and toffees which were not produced by the plaintiffs and where the wrappers were printed with the wards <ORG> action for passing off cannot be supported by the plaintiff who sold condensed milk under the trademark <ORG> in tins or cans having different size type and shape The opposition was put in by proprietors of said mark saying that the said trade mark was being used by the opposite party in respect of Racketed tea Again the case is having facts of its own kind In the said case the question which arose for decision was whether the smoking tobacco being manufactured under the one trade mark and chewing tobacco being manufactured under the same trade mark is likely to deceive the public or not The <ORG> held that the vital element in such a case is probability of deception and this may depend on number of matters as well as the question of similarity of the marks or of the get up It was also held in this case that a judge cannot properly decide except upon evidence as to the classes or kinds of goods which are protected by the appellants mark or to be more precise on the question whether purchasers of chewing tobacco from the respondent in the packets and tins above described are likely to be missed into thinking that that article is manufactured or put upon the market by the appellants So on merits the <ORG> has come to the conclusion that there was no evidence to show that any such confusion could take place although both the parties were using the same trade mark in respect of their goods The absolute Identical of the two competing marks or their close resemblance is only one of the tests for determining the question of likelihood of deception or confusion Ex hypothesi this latter test applies only when the goods are different and these tests are independent tests <ORG> observed that there is no reason why the test of trade connection between different goods should not apply The Court assumed that liquid glucose is used in the manufacture of biscuits with glucose and held that there is a trade connection between the glucose and biscuits and a likelihood of confusion or deception arising there from would appear from the fact stated by the appellant that it received from a tradesman an inquiry for biscuits manufactured by it under its mark Glucovita In the said case <ORG> held that there was no likelihood of confusion or deception because the respondent goods were confined to contraceptives for use by women which could only be used with medical assistance while the appellant contraceptives were essentially for men <ORG> of this Court held that there is a real tangible danger of confusion if the trade mark of the appellant is continued to remain on the Register as it was found that many electrical goods shops not only sell radios but also domestic electrical appliances the trade mark CALTEX was being used by one party in respect of petrol and various oil products It was held by a Division Bench of the said Court that person seeing the mark attached to watches which was a new class of goods would presume or was most likely to assume that they originated from the proprietor of the mark naturally the opponents In para <ORG> observed that in this case goods were totally different and there is no trade connection between them and there is no connection in the course of trade nor any common trade channels and there are factors against holding that there would be any danger of deception or confusion but the trade factors cannot be ignored which tend to show that there is likelihood of creating deception and confusion So even though for the sake of arguments it is to be assumed that the goods manufactured by the defendants have no trade connection with the good marketed by the plaintiffs still the common customer who is purchasing the goods is likely to be deceived with the new products of the defendants in all probabilities considering the same as manufactured by the plaintiff because they are being marketed under the same trade mark In view of the above disussion I conclude that the plaintiff has a sirong prima fade case and the balance of convenience also lies in favor of therefore <ORG> <ORG> and and nr
