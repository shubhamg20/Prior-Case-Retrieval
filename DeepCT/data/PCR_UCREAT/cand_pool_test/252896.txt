On the death of his father in the plaintiff became the owner of the building Section iii of the Principal Act provided that it was not applicable to non residential buildings the rental value of which according to the assessment of <ORG> exceeded Rs Thereupon the plaintiff filed an application under IX of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside its order dismissing the suit as having abated The defendants filed additional written statements in <ORG> raising the plea that the suit had actually abated by virtue of of the Amending Act He passed a decree for possession and damages for use and occupation Allowing the appeal HELD Section of the Amending Act was applicable to the suit as it was a proceeding instituted in <ORG> on the ground that the building was exempt from the provisions of the Principal Act by virtue of iii thereof although no express allegation was made in the plaint to that effect It was not for the court to ask whether there was any justification for the legislature to make a contrary provision in respect of the suits of the present nature There was every justification for enacting in order to give protection to the tenants against whom suits for eviction had been filed for buildings which were brought within the scope of the Principal ACT by deleting cl iii of of the Principal Act The position would not have been different even if a decree for eviction had been passed against him before June and the decree had not been executed or satisfied in full on that date The view of <ORG> that the suit property was not a building within the meaning of on the ground that there was no lease in force and hence it was not let and that on that date the plaintiff had no intention to lease it and therefore it was not to be let was erroneous The opening clause of of the Principal Act suggests that any expression defined in that section should be given a meaning assigned to it therein unless the context otherwise requires When the suit filed on March stood terminated with the coming into force of the amending Act on June there was no plaint in a live suit which could be amended by the addition of new parties and the inclusion of a new prayer Therefore the addition of parties which took place after the death of the original defendant and the amendment of the plaint in requesting the court to pass a decree against defendants to who were not parties to the suit prior to June on a cause of action which accrued subsequent to January were without jurisdiction The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The question involved in this case is whether a suit for ejectment filed in respect of any non residential building or part thereof pending before any court on the date on which the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act Act No XVIII of hereinafter referred to as the principal Act was amended by the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Amendment Act Act No XI of hereinafter referred to as the Amending Act could have been proceeded with after that date He leased it out in favour of the defendant <NAME> under a lease deed dated July for the purpose of Running a restaurant known as <ORG> in it for a period of three years with effect from July on a monthly rent of Rs On the death of the landlord <NAME> in under a partition amongst his heirs the plaintiff became the owner of the building The protection which the defendant was enjoying under the Act of came to an end on the passing of the principal Act by virtue of section thereof which repealed the Act of and section iii thereof which provided that nothing contained in the principal Act was applicable to any non residential building the rental value of which on the date of the commencement of the principal Act as entered in the property tax assessment book of the municipal council district board panchayat or panchayat union council or <ORG> exceeded Rs The plaintiff issued a notice to the defendant terminating the tenancy with effect from the expiry of February and as the building was not governed by the principal Act at that point of time he instituted a suit in Civil Suit No of on the file of <ORG> Madras on March for eviction and for damages at the rate of Rs The defendant filed his written statement on May before the City <ORG> Every proceeding in respect of any non residential building or part thereof pending before any court or other authority or officer on the date of the publication of this Act in <ORG> and instituted on the ground that such building or part was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act by virtue of clause iii of section of the principal Act shall abate in so far as the proceeding relates to such building or part All rights and privileges which may have accrued before such date to any landlord in respect of any non residential building or part thereof by virtue of clause iii of section of the principal Act shall cease and determine and shall not be enforceable Provided that nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to invalidate any suit or proceeding in which the decree or order passed has been executed or satisfied in full before the date mentioned in this section Under section of the said Act certain buildings are exempted from the provisions of the said Act It has been brought to the notice of the <ORG> that the landlords of such non residential buildings taking advantage of the exemption referred to above demand exorbitant rents from the tenants of such buildings who mostly belong to the business community and threaten to evict the tenants when the latter do not concede to the demands for such rents At the same time the <ORG> consider that there is no need to take away the exemption available at present to any residential building or part thereof fetching a monthly rent exceeding Rs The Bill seeks to achieve the above object The result of the amendment was that the buildings which had been exempted from the operation of the principal Act under clause iii of section came within the scope of the principal Act and the relationship between landlords and tenants of such buildings was to be regulated thereafter in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act Apparently in order to give protection to tenants of such buildings against whom proceedings for eviction had been instituted in civil courts section of the Amending Act provided that such proceedings should be treated as having abated The proviso to section of the Amending Act however provided that nothing contained in that section should be deemed to invalidate any suit or proceeding in which the decree or order passed had been executed or satisfied in full before the date mentioned in that section the said date being June The plaintiff filed two applications before <ORG> in March one under order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside the order dated December dismissing the suit as having abated and another under section of the Limitation Act for condoning delay in filing the application under order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure On August the defendant filed an additional written statement before <ORG> raising the plea that the suit had actually abated by virtue of section of the Amending Act In the meanwhile on an application made under section of the Code of Civil Procedure by the plaintiff the suit was withdrawn to the file of <ORG> and it was renumbered as No of appointing executors and administrators in respect of his assets and issuing directions regarding the manner in which his assets should be disposed of by <ORG> and the Appeal Suit No of filed by the plaintiff against the order of <ORG> dated December were disposed of by a Division Bench of <ORG> by a common order on June the relevant part or which read as follows It is seen from the foregoing dates that at the time of the dismissal of the suit the lower court had no jurisdiction to deal with suit and in that view the counsel appearing on both sides represent that the order dismissing the suit as having abated may be set aside and the suit may be tried on the original side of this Court We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the order of dismissal of the suit on the ground that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to deal with the same on the date of dismissal and direct the suit to be posted on the original side for being dealt with After the amendment of the plaint fresh written statements were filed by defendants Nos to raising several pleas including the pleas which had already been raised in the written statements filed by defendant No before <ORG> The learned Judge proceeded to dispose of the suit as if it was a fresh suit instituted after the death of the original defendant No on January even though there was no specific issue on the question whether it cd be treated such This appears to be so in view of the following observations made by the trial Judge in the course of his judgment Under the above circumstances if the plaintiff files a suit today against the defendants he is entitled to get an executable decree for possession without the necessity of going to <ORG> inasmuch as defendants to had never become tenants under the Act <ORG> is held to have abated under the peculiar circumstances of this case I see no reason why I should not treat the suit before me to be a fresh one Even if <ORG> had no pecuniary jurisdiction to deal with the matter and record abatement the defendants could have pressed in A No of for an order by this <ORG> that the suit had abated The plaintiff in his appeal questioned the decree of the trial court only to the extent it granted a period of three years to the defendants to deliver possession of the premises Both the appeals came up for hearing before <ORG> of <ORG> Whether the suit instituted by the plaintiff abated in view of section of the Tamil Nadu Act XI of The appeal filed by the plaintiff was also dismissed as a period of years out of the period of three years time granted by the trial court had expired by the time the judgment in appeal was delivered Aggrieved by the decree passed by <ORG> defendants to and have filed the above appeal by special leave in this <ORG> The undisputed facts in this case are <NAME> held the suit property as a lessee before the institution of the suit that the lease had been terminated by the issue of a notice in accordance with section of the Transfer of Property Act that a suit for eviction of <NAME> was filed on March before <ORG> Madras which was competent to try it on the date of its institution I that by virtue of alteration of the pecuniary jurisdiction of <ORG> and consequential provisions made in that connection the suit stood transferred to the file of the original side of <ORG> with effect from May and that the suit was therefore deemed to be pending in law on the file of <ORG> on June on which date the Amending Act was published in the official <ORG> even though in fact the file was Lying on that date with <ORG> The other proceedings which have been referred to above in some detail are not relevant for the purpose of deciding the question whether the suit abated on the publication of the Amending Act in the official <ORG> Consequently any non residential building the rental value of which on the date of the commencement of the principal Act as entered in the property tax assessment book of the municipal council <ORG> panchayat or panchayat union council or <ORG> as the case may be exceeded four hundred rupees per mensem was also brought within the scope of the principal Act and the relationship between the landlord and tenant of such building came to be regulated by it with effect from June Section of the Amending Act consists of three parts Under the first part it directed that every proceeding in respect of any nonresidential building or part thereof pending before any court or other authority or officer on the date of the publication of the Amending Act in <ORG> and instituted on the ground that such building or part was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act by virtue of clause iii of section of the principal Act abated in so far as the proceedings related to such building or part The proviso to section which is the third part of that section provided that nothing contained in section should be deemed to invalidate any suit or proceeding in which the decree or order passed had been executed or satisfied in full before the date mentioned in that section On behalf of the plaintiff three contentions were urged in the appeal before <ORG> in support of his case that section of the Amending Act was inapplicable to the present case They were i that section of the Amending Act had no reference to a suit at all ii that even if it had any reference to a suit it did not apply to a suit of the present nature and iii that even if it applied to a suit of the present nature still on the pleadings of the plaintiff It is not for the Court to ask whether there was any justification for the <ORG> to make a contrary provision in respect of the suits of the present nature In that situation <ORG> had no option but to apply the provision in question to the case on hand without going into the question whether there was any justification for enacting it Of the view that in the circumstances in which the Amending Act came to be enacted there was every justification for enacting section in order to give protection to tenants against whom suits for eviction had been filed from buildings which were brought within the scope of the principal Act by deleting clause iii of section of the principal Act i that there should be a proceeding in respect of a non residential building or part thereof ii that proceeding should be pending before any court or other authority or officer on the date of the publication of the Amending Act in <ORG> and iii that proceeding should have been instituted on the ground that such building or part thereof was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act by virtue of clause iii of section of the principal Act existed <ORG> upheld the above contention observing that in order to attract section of the Amending Act there should be an allegation in the plaint that the building in question was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act by virtue of clause iii of section of the principal Act It is not very clear how a proceeding could have been instituted on the ground that such building or part was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act by virtue of clause iii of or what is the precise scope of the rights and privileges which may accrue to the landlord and which are to cease and determine In the case of <ORG> supra the effect of section of the Amending Act is set out as follows The obvious result of section iii of the Act as it stood before the amendment was that if the rental value of a non residential building as entered in the property tax book of the <ORG> exceeded Rs It applies firstly to cases in which a proceeding has been instituted on the ground that a non residential building was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act and is pending and secondly to cases where rights and privileges which may have accrued before such date to any landlord in respect of non residential building by virtue of clause iii of section of the principal Act exist In the kind of case falling in the first category the amendment says that the pending proceedings shall abate The above observations were made by this Court in a case where a proceeding had been initiated before the City Rent Controller in December by a landlord for eviction of his tenant from a non residential building situated in the city of Madras which had been leased at Rs In exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under section of The principal Act <ORG> reversed the judgment and order of <ORG> holding that the rights of the landlord and tenant were governed on the date of the application for eviction by section ii a of the principal Act which contained a prohibition against sub letting which involved parting with possession On appeal to this Court the decision of <ORG> was affirmed holding that the effect of the amendment was that the landlord acquired a new right to evict a tenant under section ii a This <ORG> did not however go into the question as to what types of cases would fall within the scope of section of the Amending Act We have already referred to the object with which the Amending Act was passed and that was to give relief against unreasonable evictions and demands for unconscionable rates of rents to tenants of buildings which had been originally exempted from the operation of the principal Act The suit in the above form could be filed for the relief referred to above only because of the exemption granted by clause iii of section of the principal Act because in the absence of such exemption no effective decree for ejectment could be passed by <ORG> in view of section of the principal Act which provided that no tenant could be evicted from a building except in accordance with the provisions of section and section to thereof Of the view that section of the Amending Act was applicable to the suit in question as it was a proceeding instituted in <ORG> on the ground that the building in question was exempt from the provisions of the principal Act by virtue of clause iii of section thereof although no express allegation was made in the plaint to that effect In order to get over the inevitable consequences flowing from section of the Amending Act and the effect of an earlier decision of <ORG> of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> a novel and ingenious contention was urged on behalf of the plaintiff the said contention being that after the termination of the lease with effect from February by the issue of a notice under section of the Transfer of Property Act the original defendant became a trespasser and the premises in question ceased to be a building as defined in section of the principal Act On the above basis it was contended that the original defendant could not claim the benefit of any of the provisions of the principal Act and section of the Amending Act It was argued that since a contention of this nature had not been considered in the case of <NAME> supra it had no binding effect on <ORG> which heard this case The decree provided for a direction for eviction against the quondam tenant subject to cer tain terms thereafter mentioned to wit the landlord being entitled to take possession of the portion of the premises in occupation of one <ORG> and <ORG> immediately by executing the decree in so far as The said portion was concerned and the quondam tenant delivering possession of the rest of the portion in his occupation on or before st January and the quondam tenant paying mesne profits at Rs The decree also provided that if there was default in payment of the sum of Rs or the other sum per month the landlord would be entitled to execute the decree immediately From the facts of <NAME> case supra it is clear that <ORG> of <ORG> had held that a tenant whose tenancy had been terminated with effect from October and against whom a decree for eviction had been passed prior to the date on which section of the Amending Act came into force was entitled to be treated as a tenant by virtue of the said provision since he had continued to remain in possession of the property even after the termination of the tenancy The only ground on which <ORG> which heard the present case did not follow the ruling in <NAME> case supra is that the effect of the termination of tenancy prior to the date on which <ORG> of came into force had not been considered in that case On going through the decision in <NAME> case supra we are of the view that the appropriate procedure which <ORG> should have followed in this case was to refer it to a full Bench instead of bypassing the said decision in the manner in which it has been done in this case We have noticed with some regret that when the earlier decision of two judges of the same <ORG> in <NAME> case was cited before the learned Judges who heard the present appeal they took on themselves to say that the previous decision was wrong instead of following the usual procedure in case of difference of opinion with an earlier decision of referring the question to a larger Bench Be that as it may we are of the view that having regard to our finding that the suit stood abated on June by virtue of the provisions of section of the Amending Act the original defendant <NAME> became a statutory tenant of the premises in question and he could not be evicted from the premises except in accordance with the procedure specified in the principal Act The position would not have been different even if a decree for eviction had been passed against him before June and the decree had not been executed or satisfied in full on that date The several decisions on which reliance was placed by <ORG> for determining the character of possession of the original defendant <NAME> after the expiry of the notice given under section of the Transfer of Property Act were not relevant for the purpose of this case because in none of them there was any occasion to consider the effect of a provision similar to section of the Amending Act We have already referred to the claim of their plaintiff in his plaint that he needed the building for his own use and the contention of late <NAME> in his written statement dated that the plaintiff was merely anxious to extort higher rent and for that purpose had from time to time approached him that although he was prepared to pay a reasonable rent he was not willing to pay anything exorbitant and that it is because of that the plaintiff had instituted the present suit on a pretence of requiring it for his own business Therefore we have to proceed on the basis that it was not the case of the defend its that the plaintiff wanted to let the premises in question The opening clause of section of the principal Act itself suggests that any expression defined in that section should be given the meaning assigned to it therein unless the content otherwise requires The two fold reasoning of <ORG> for holding that the building in question was not a building is that on June i there was no lease in force and hence it was not let and ii that on that date the plaintiff had no intention to lease it and therefore it was not to be let This view receives support from the definition of the expression tenant in section of the principal Act which includes a person continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour It thus becomes clear that the Suit came to an end in the eye of law on June and the original defendant became entitled to the protection of the principal Act He could thereafter be evicted from the building only after an order was made by the Controller under any of the provisions of the principal Act which conferred jurisdiction on him to do so As mentioned earlier no formal order was passed by <ORG> on its original side stating that the suit had abated on June till the death of the original defendant which took place The next significant step that was taken before <ORG> was the application made by the appellant in the year requesting the <ORG> to permit him to amend the plaint by the inclusion of a prayer for possession against defendants Nos to on the basis that they were not tenants as defined in section of the principal Act Defendants Nos to thereafter filed their written statements and the issues framed in the suit were recast in the light of the pleadings Even if the proceeding was treated as a fresh suit against defendants Nos to it could be treated as such only from a date subsequent to January on which date the original defendant did since the contention of the plaintiff which found favour with the learned single judge and <ORG> of <ORG> was that defendants Nos to who were legal representatives of the original defendant could not succeed to the tenancy right of the original defendant In the instant case since the plaintiff based his claim on the above contention in the year when he made the application for amendment of the plaint the date of the institution of the fresh suit could not be earlier than the date on which the application for amendment was made even if it was permissible to do so By his judgment the learned single Judge passed a decree for possession against defendants Nos to and for damages to be determined under order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure without specifying the date from which damages would be payable We are of the view that the addition of new parties which took place after the death of <NAME> and the amendment of the plaint in the year and the passing of the decree by the trial Judge against defendants Nos to who were not parties to the suit prior to June on a cause of action which accrued subsequent to January were all without jurisdiction Pan that since the parties had gone to trial with open eyes knowing fully that the plaintiff was relying upon a cause of action which accrued in his favour after the death of the original defendant and on the basis of the amendment of the plaint in the year the decree passed by the trial court and affirmed by <ORG> of <ORG> should not be interfered with in the interests of justice and equity It was possible for this <ORG> to do so in that case because there was no legal impediment as we have in the present case It is thus seen that there was no proceeding in the eye of law rending after June the cause of action on the basis of which relief was claimed was totally different and the persons against whom the relief was sought were also different In view of our finding on issue No we hold that the decree passed by the trial court and the appellate court are unsustainable We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the decrees passed by the trial court and by <ORG> of <ORG> and dispose of the suit as having abated on June
