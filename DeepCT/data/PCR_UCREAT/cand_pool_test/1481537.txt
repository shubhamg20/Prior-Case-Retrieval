In these appeals a short but an important question of law arises for our consideration as to the interpretation of Section of the Land Acquisition Act the Act and the procedure to be followed by the appropriate <ORG> while dispensing with the inquiry contemplated under Section A of the Act These question arose for consideration before <ORG> of <ORG> which on facts came to conclusion that the Lt Governor of Delhi who was the authority to pass orders under Section of the Act did not apply his mind as to the existence of need for the dispensation of A inquiry Governor was not informed that there was an earlier attempt to acquire land measuring bighas for the same public purpose and said acquisition had lapsed by afflux of time which also contributed to non application of mind It is in the above background a notification dated under Section of the Act came to be published Being aggrieved by this notification the owners of the land and persons interested filed Civil Writ Petitions before <ORG> primarily contending that there was no such urgency which require the invocation of Section and of the Act by deleting A inquiry During the course of hearing before <ORG> the records of proceedings were summoned and the court examined whether there was any material to indicate the application of mind by the Lt <ORG> after copiously referring to the notings in the file and considering the various judgments cited before it came to the conclusion that there was no application of mind by the Lt <ORG> on the material placed before it also noticed the fact that in regard to bighas of land out of the bighas now sought to be acquired in the same Khasra <ORG> by a notification dated did try to acquire the said land for the same public purpose which acquisition came to be questioned before <ORG> in a writ petition and when the matter was pending before the Division Bench even though there was no interim order since no further steps were taken by the acquiring authorities the said acquisition lapsed Consequently the declaration made under Section of the Act came to be quashed It directed that the acquiring authority should give an opportunity to the persons interested to file their objections and the same should be heard by the concerned authority and further acquisition proceedings should be proceeded with and concluded within the time and manner stipulated in the impugned judgment Though it is strictly not necessary for us to go into the subsequent events that had taken place after the impugned judgment of <ORG> it may be of some relevance to note that after the judgment of <ORG> the authorities held the A inquiry and after considering the report of the Collector a fresh Section declaration has already been issued but the same is pending fresh challenge before <ORG> at present Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the principal public purpose for which the land was sought to be acquired is of great public importance to the people of Delhi He further submitted that Section of the Act is a special provision which empowers the acquiring authorities when so directed by the appropriate <ORG> to proceed to take possession of the land as contemplated in the said Section He contended that the urgency contemplated under sub sections and of Section by itself are sufficient for invoking Section to exclude the inquiry and in the instant case the appellants themselves having given up their challenge as to the existence of the urgency under Section they can not contend that there was no urgency to invoke Section of the Act therefore the Lt Governor rightly entertained the said urgency under Section invoking Section and to exclude A inquiry Mr <NAME> submitted from the material on record it is clear that right from the time of initiation of acquisition proceedings there was application of mind in regard to the exclusion of inquiry under Section A at every stage Having regard to the enormous growth of population in the country the governmental schemes of development of residential areas such as those of <ORG> constituted by the State <ORG>s for cities now demand emergent action eliminating summary enquiry under Section A of the Land Acquisition Act On the basis of the above observations of this Court learned counsel submitted in a given case the delay by itself could exhilarate the urgency as in this case when an attempt to acquire the land for a genuine public purpose was for some reason or the other has remained unfulfilled from the year the High Court ought to have held the delay already occurred itself was sufficient evidence of the factum of urgency to exclude Section A wherein this Court held thus The question of urgency of an acquisition under Section and of the Act is a matter of subjective satisfaction of the Government and ordinarily it is not open to the court to make a scrutiny of the propriety of that satisfaction on an objective appraisal of facts Learned counsel also relied on another judgment of this Court in <NAME> vs State of Ors Therefore there was no need to pass any reasoned order to reach the conclusion that there is urgency so as to dispense with the enquiry under Section A in exercise of power under Section Taking support from the above judgment as stated above Mr <NAME> submitted <ORG> exceeded its jurisdiction by re appraising the factual basis on which the appropriate Government came to the conclusion that there was urgency requiring the exclusion of Section A inquiry which is impermissible in law Before adverting to the arguments of learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents we would like to refer to one of the grounds raised by way of preliminary objections by the respondents which is in regard to the maintainability of these appeals on the ground that pursuant to the directions issued by <ORG> the acquiring authorities have conducted a A inquiry and a fresh declaration under Section has already been made therefore these appeals are not maintainable But in fairness we must note that the learned counsel appearing for the respondents has not pressed this objection any further than raising the same in the pleadings Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents rebutted the arguments of learned counsel for the appellants He submitted that under the Scheme of the Act each and every section from Sections to has an independent role to play though there is an element of interaction between them It is his argument that the entire acquisition proceedings under the Act are based on the principle of eminent domain and the only protection given to a person whose land is sought to be acquired is an opportunity under Section A of the Act to convince the acquiring authority that the public purpose for which the land is sought to be acquired is in fact is not a public purpose and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public purpose Therefore according to the learned counsel excluding this inquiry can only be an exception where the urgency cannot brook any delay He also submitted this inquiry provides an opportunity to the owner of the land to convince the authorities concerned that the land in question is not suitable for the purpose for which it is sought to be acquired or the same is sought to be acquired for collateral purpose In other words the learned counsel contends that assuming that there is urgency for taking possession of the land as contemplated under sub sections and by excluding the operation of Section and the time mentioned in Section of the Act the same would not by itself give rise to the required urgency to avoid an inquiry under Section A Learned counsel also copiously referred to the various notings in the file and pointed out that this aspect of the urgency which is necessary for excluding an inquiry under Section A of the Act was not taken note of He also pointed out that in almost all the notings on the file which were considered by <ORG> there was actually no reference to Section at all much less any reference to the need for excluding the inquiry under Section A of the Act It is also pointed out by the learned counsel from the records that even on the final noting of the Lt Governor dated pursuant to which a preliminary notification was issued there is no reference to the exclusion of the inquiry under Section A of the Act Governor did not apply his mind to the need for dispensing with the inquiry under Section A of the Act Keeping in mind the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties we will now examine certain relevant provisions of the Act to understand the scheme of the Act This section itself provides for a procedure for publication of the notice and puts an embargo on the future dealings by the owners of the said property As noted above the reports submitted after this inquiry may not be binding on the appropriate Government but the same is necessary to be considered by appropriate Government at the same time the report can not be left out of consideration Section contemplates an inquiry and award being made by the Collector and Section contemplates when an award is made under Section the collector is entitled to take possession of the land which thereupon vests absolutely with the Government In cases of urgency whenever the Appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any land needed for a public purpose Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river side or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station or the appropriate Government considers it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation water supply drainage road communication or electricity the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the government free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty eight hours notice of his intention so to do or such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience In every case under either of preceding sub sections the Collector shall at the time of taking possession offer to the persons interested compensation for the standing crops and trees if any on such land and for any other damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and not excepted in section and in case such offer is not accepted the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding compensation for the land under the provisions herein contained A In the case if any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section A careful perusal of the above Section shows that sub section of Sec Therefore it is seen that if the appropriate Government decides that there is an urgency to invoke Section in the normal course Section notice will have to be published Section declaration will have to be made and after completing the procedure contemplated under Sections and notice will have to be given and on expiration of days from the date of such notice the authorities can take possession of the land even before passing of an award Therefore in cases where Government is satisfied that there is an unforeseen emergency it will have to in the normal course issue a Section notification hold A inquiry make Section declaration and issue Section notice and possession can be taken immediately thereafter without waiting for the period of days prescribed under Section of the Act Section as noticed above provides that in cases where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there exists an urgency or unforeseen emergency as required under sub sections or of Section it may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if such direction is given then A inquiry can be dispensed with and a declaration may be made under Section on publication of notification possession can be made A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a condition precedent for invoking Section that by itself is not sufficient to direct the dispensation of A inquiry It requires an opinion to be formed by the concerned government that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for dispensing with A inquiry which indicates that the <ORG> intended that the appropriate government to apply its mind before dispensing with A inquiry But then that is not language of the Section which in our opinion requires the appropriate <ORG> to further consider the need for dispensing with A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency This understanding of ours as to the requirement of an application of mind by the appropriate <ORG> while dispensing with A inquiry does not mean that in and every case when there is an urgency contemplated under Section and unforeseen emergency contemplated under Section exists that by itself would not contain the need for dispensing with A inquiry It is possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate <ORG> under Section or the unforeseen emergency under Section itself may be of such degree that it could require the appropriate <ORG> on that very basis to dispense with the inquiry under Section A but then there is a need for application of mind by the appropriate <ORG> that such an urgency for dispensation of the A inquiry is inherent in the two types of urgencies contemplated under Section and of the Act An argument was sought to be advanced on behalf of the appellants that once the appropriate <ORG> comes to the conclusion that there is an urgency or unforeseen emergency under Section and the dispensation of enquiry under Section A becomes automatic and the same can be done by a composite order meaning thereby that there no need for the appropriate <ORG> to separately apply its mind for any further emergency for dispensation with an inquiry under Section A We are unable to agree with the above argument because sub section of Section itself indicates that the government may direct that provisions of Section A shall not apply which makes it clear that not in every case where the appropriate <ORG> has come to the conclusion that there is urgency and under sub section or unforeseen emergency under sub section of Section the <ORG> will ipso facto have to direct the dispensation of inquiry SCR wherein considering the language of Section of the Act which was then referable to waste or arable land and the Amendment to the said section held thus It will be seen that gives power to the <ORG> to direct the Collector though no award has been made under to take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purpose and such land thereupon vests absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Then comes which provides that in case of any land to which the provisions of sub are applicable the <ORG> may direct that the provisions of A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the notification under It will be seen that it is not necessary even where the <ORG> makes a direction under that it should also make a direction under If the <ORG> makes a direction only under the procedure under A would still have to be followed before a notification under is issued though after that procedure has been followed and a notification under is issued the Collector gets the power to take possession of the land after the notice under without waiting for the award and on such taking possession the land shall vest absolutely in <ORG> free from all encumbrances It is only when the <ORG> also makes a declaration under that it becomes unnecessary to take action under A and make a report thereunder It may be that generally where an order is made under an order under is also passed but in law it is not necessary that this should be so It will also be seen that under the Land Acquisition Act an order under or can only be passed with respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with respect to land which is not waste or arable and on which buildings stand At this stage it is relevant to notice that the limited right given to an owner person interested under Section A of the Act to object to the acquisition proceedings is not an empty formality and is a substantive right which can be taken away for good and valid reason and within the limitations prescribed under Section of the Act The legislature has made complete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections It is only in cases of urgency that special powers have been conferred on the appropriate Government to dispense with the provisions of Section A It is clear from the above observation of this Court that right of representation and hearing contemplated under Section A of the Act is a very valuable right of a person whose property is sought to be acquired and he should have appropriate and reasonable opportunity of persuading the authorities concerned that the acquisition of the property belonging to that person should not be made We will now refer to the facts of the present case We make it clear that this consideration of facts by us is not for the purpose of finding out whether the stated public purpose is in reality a public purpose or not nor is it for the purpose of finding out whether there was an urgency as contemplated under Section of the Act but limited to the question of whether there was any material available before the Lt There is no material on record to show that either the said festival has been discontinued for want of land or the owners of the land where the festival has its concluding ceremony are preventing the utilisation of that land for the said purpose We have also noticed hereinabove that an earlier attempt to acquire bighas of the land for the very same purpose was allowed to be lapsed by the authorities concerned by afflux of time which is also a relevant factor to be taken note of by the Lt These facts coupled with the findings of <ORG> that in almost all the notings in the file there is no reference to the need for invoking Section indicates that the Lt
