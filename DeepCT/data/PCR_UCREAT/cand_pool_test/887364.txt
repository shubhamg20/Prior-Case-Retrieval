Since an identical question of law arises for determination in each of these applications preferred by the <ORG> under the Madras Agricultural Income tax Act of to which we shall refer in the rest of this judgment as the Act we shall dispose of the applications by a single judgment In each of these cases the assessee claimed that the sum he paid his employee in some cases that employee was designated the manager and in others as superintendent as bonus in the relevant year of account was a permissible deduction under Section of the Act The main contention of the learned Advocate General who appeared for the petitioner <ORG> was that Section of the Act was the only statutory provision under which the assessee was entitled to deduction of payments of bonus and as admittedly the claim of the assessee in each of these cases did not fall within the scope of Section of the Act the claim of the assessee should be negatived The relevant Sub sections of Section of Act of are Section The agriculiural income of a person shall be computed after making the following deductions namely any expenditure incurred in the previous year not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the land any sum paid to a worker as defined in the Plantations Labour Act Central Act LXIX of as bonus for services rendered where such sum would not have been payable to him as profits or dividend if it had not been paid as bonus Provided that the bonus is of a reasonable amount with reference to i the wages and conditions of service of such worker ii the income from the land in the year in question and iii die general practice in the land Provided that no deduction shall be made under this section if it has already been made in the assessment under the Indian Income tax Act a Central Act XI of or is allowable in assessing a person to tax under that Act Section of Act LXIX of provides the statutory definition of worker Worker means a person employed in a plantation for hire or reward whether directly or through any agency to do any work skilled unskilled manual or clerical but does not include a a medical officer at the plantation any person whose monthly wages exceed Rs Those employed in work on any other class of agricultural or horticultural land will also be obviously outside the scope of workers as that expression has to be understood in the context of Section of the Act of To bring the claim for deduction within the scope of Section I of the Act what the assessee has to establish is i That the payment was made in the relevant year of account ii that the payment was to an employee who is a worker as defined by Central Act LXIX of iii that the payment was made as a bonus iv that the payment as bonus was for services rendered by the employee the recipient of the bonus and the amount so paid as bonus would not have been payable to that employee as profits or dividend It should be obvious that but for the specific provision in Section of the Act even payment of bonus to a worker within the scope of Section which satisfied the test of Section that it was expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the land would have been a permissible deduction under Section of the Act But we are unable to accept as correct his further submission that the statutory requirement that the payment should be to a worker is just one more of the tests to be satisfied and that it is not a factor to be taken into account any more than the test of reasonableness in deciding what is the essential subject matter the pith and substance of the legislative provision in Section of the Act As we read Section I in the context of the Act the subject matter of that statutory provision is in the words of the Sub section itself sums paid to a worker as bonus for services rendered or at least sums paid to a worker as bonus worker of course being understood in the terms of Act LXIX of Section of the Income tax Act provides Profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely any sum paid to an employee as bonus or commission for services rendered where such sum would not have been payable to him as profits or dividend if it had not been paid as bonus or commission Provided that the amount of bonus or commission is of a reasonable amount with reference to a the pay of the employee and the conditions of his service the profiis of the business profession or vocation in the year in question and the general practice in similar businesses professions or vocations xv any expenditure not being an allowance of the nature described in any of the Clauses i to xiu inclusive and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business profession or vocation There was no specific statutory provision in the Act to deal with payments by way of bonus to other class of employees and in the absence of any specific statutory provision the general provision Section of the Act should apply to decide whether such payments constitute admissible deductions The acceptance of the contentions of the learned Advocate General that no bonus payment other than the payment to the limited class of employees designated workers would be a permissible item of deduction would involve reading Section of the Act as if it ran Any sum paid to an employee as bonus for services rendered provided that no deduction shall be made if the payment was to an employee other than a worker as defined by Act LXIX of We can see no justification for so reading Section of the Act or interpret it to lead to that result Such payments to employees other than statutory workers constitute an item of expenditure and if that satisfies the test of Section of the Act it must be allowed as a deduction We agree with the <ORG> that in each of these cases the assessee was entitled to deduct these items of expenditure under Section of the Act in computing his assessable agricultural income
