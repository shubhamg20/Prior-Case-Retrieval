Appeal by special leave granted by <ORG> by its order dated the th March from the Judgment and Order dated the th day of June of <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> The firm was carrying on business at Calcutta as bullion merchants dealing mainly in silver and kept its books of account on the mercantile basis The application by the firm under section of the Act asking for a reference to <ORG> of six questions as questions of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> was also rejected The firm being admittedly resident and ordinarily resident within the meaning of sections A and in what was then known as British India its total income would include also income accruing or arising to it without British India under section ii It comes into existence when the valuation is made and since it arises out of the valuation it arises in respect of the whole stock in trade at the site of the firm whose stock in trade is being valued irrespective of where parts of the stock in trade may be While we agree with the conclusion that no part of the profits of the firm in the accounting year can be said to have accrued or arisen at Bikaner the reasoning by which the learned Judges arrived at that conclusion seems to us with all respect to proceed on a misconception As such profits can be correctly ascertained according to the method adopted by an assessee only after bringing into the trading account his closing stock wherever it may exist the whole of the profits must be taken to accrue or arise at the place of carrying on the business We agree with <ORG> that the question referred should be answered in the affirmative though on different grounds The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
