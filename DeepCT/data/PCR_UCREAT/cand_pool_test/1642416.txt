In July the landlord filed an eviction petition against the appellant on the ground of bona fide require ment In March the first respondent filed a petition before <ORG> that the wife of the appellant having been allotted a residential quarter came within the mischief of clause of Section of the Act and was therefore liable for eviction It was further contended that the allotted accommodation could not be treated as alternative accommodation for the appellant and his family The husband would not therefore have any statutory or legal right against the <ORG> to use and enjoy the allotted prem ises to the wife of the tenant because of her job There is no law according to which husband and wife could be deemed to be one person If a wife or husband acquires a property and the other spouse if he she is the tenant has a legal right by virtue of such acquisition and stay there then only can such acquisition or allotment of premises would disentitle or attract the provisions of cl of section of the Act otherwise the whole purpose would be defeated From the fact that the wife of the tenant was allot ted a temporary <ORG> accommodation it cannot be said that there was admission by virtue of which the tenant could lose his tenancy that the wife has acquired a house which is available to the husband over which the husband has a domain which could be a substitute to the tenanted premises Where one spouse is entitled to occupy a dwelling house by virtue of any estate or interest or con tract or by virtue of any enactment giving him or her the right to remain in occupation and the other spouse is not so entitled then the spouse not so entitled has the certain rights known as rights of occupation that is to say if in occupation a right not to be evicted or excluded from the dwelling house or any part of it by the other spouse except with the leave of the court given by an order if not in occupation a right with the leave of the court so given to enter into and occupy the dwelling house But with the change of situation and complex problems arising it is high time to give the wife or the spouse a right of occupation in a truly matrimonial home in case of marriage breaking up or in case of strained relationship between the husband and the wife The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> What is the true meaning of the expression tenant has before or after the commencement of the Act built acquired vacant possession of or been allotted a residence in terms of clause of Section of the Delhi Rent Control Act hereinafter called the Act is the question raised in this appeal in the backdrop of interesting set of facts There were differences of opinion It was stated that the tenant had strained relationship with his wife and on ac count of the same only she had acquired a separate accommo dation and started staying there and got her ration card prepared at the same address but since the appellant had grown up children and remained on touring job therefore in order to provide the required protection and care the wife of the appellant came to the house in question temporarily But the learned Additional Rent Controller directed that no evidence need be necessary as the matter could be decided on admitted facts In view of the provisions of law as the tenant had acquired vacant possession for residence became disentitled to retain the premises in question he therefore passed an order of eviction Being aggrieved thereby the appellant approached <ORG> in second appeal Being further aggrieved the appellant has come up to this Court as mentioned hereinbefore The respondent thereafter has now no case to be put back in possession of the flat in dispute The said decision rested on the facts of that case In those circumstances it was held that there was acquisi tion of vacant possession of a residence and as such section of the Act would be attracted If he goes to stay in the house of his wife legally speak ing he has no right as such to stay and can be turned out from the house at any time by its legal owner namely the wife There was no law according to which the husband and the wife could be deemed to be one person The learned Judge dealt with this and observed that in construing the above provision it has to be borne in mind that the scheme of the Act had to be appreciated There is no law according to which husband and wife could be deemed to be one person Therefore the correct position must be that if a wife or a husband acquires a property and the other spouse if he she is the tenant has a legal right by virtue of such acquisition and stay there then only can such acquisition or allotment of premises would disentitle or attract the provisions of cl of section otherwise the whole purpose would be defeated Dr <NAME> drew our attention to the various as pects of the case where no proper opportunity was given to the tenant to show that in fact the husband would not and did not have any right at all to come to the premises allotted to the wife which was taken because of the strained relation of the husband and wife regarding the career of the wife In such a house the hus band will not come he will certainly have no legal right or access for either staying or coming in the premises acquired by the wife Mr <NAME> tried to submit that there was no evidence before the trial court as well <ORG> of the alleged strained relationship between the parties What is necessary is that unless there is a positive evidence and here there is none of acquisition of property prima facie in the name of the tenant or allotment of flat to the tenant it cannot be said to have been ac quired by or allotted to some members of the tenant family other than the wife If there is such an acquisition by or on behalf of the tenant then the tenant and members of the tenant family would have dominion over the acquired residence In the case of this nature the appellate court had ample power in our opinion to have taken additional evidence Our attention was drawn to a decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Jabalpur Law Jour nal In our opinion from the fact that the wife of the tenant was allotted a tempo rary <ORG> accommodation it cannot be said that there was admission by virtue of which the tenant could lose his tenancy that the wife has acquired a house which is avail able to the husband over which the husband has a domain which could be a substitute to the tenanted premises In that view of the matter we are of the opinion that there was no admission at all We are not concerned here whether there was ground for bona fide requirement of the landlord for which a suit had been filed and which is pending appeal page deals with the rights of occupation in matrimonial home and paragraph deals with and provides that where one spouse is enti tled to occupy a dwelling house by virtue of any estate or interest or contract or by virtue of any enactment giving him or her the right to remain in occupation and the other spouse is not so entitled then the spouse not so entitled has the certain rights known as rights of occupation that is to say if in occupation a right not to be evicted or excluded from the dwelling house or any part of it by the other spouse except with the leave of the court given by an order if not in occupation a right with the leave of the court so given to enter into and occupy the dwelling house But such rights are not granted in India though it may be that with change of situation and complex problems arising it is high time to give the wife or the spouse a right of occupation in a truly matrimonial home in case of marriage breaking up or in case of strained relationship between the husband and the wife In those circumstances in England the landlord could not properly be granted an order for possession against the husband unless there were available grounds for possession against both husband and wife We have no such law The husband would not therefore have any statutory or legal right against the Government to use and enjoy the allotted premises to the wife of the tenant because of her job The appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of <ORG> and the Courts below are set aside
