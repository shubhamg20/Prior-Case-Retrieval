This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of <ORG> confirming the death sentence imposed upon each of the three appellants under Section read with Section of the Penal Code for the murder of five persons belonging to one family Since <NAME> did not notice as to whether any person was dead or alive and himself had seen the attack on <NAME> only in the report which he lodged he mentioned only that part of the occurrence which he had seen with his own eyes On the facts and in the circumstances of this case we find no substance in this argument The two courts of fact have rightly believed theirevidence The other criticism was that Sarpanch <NAME> and another Sarpanch named <NAME> to whom one of the prosecution witnesses had gone were not examined They were not eye witnesses and it is not possible for us to take the view that their non examination in any way affected the prosecution case There were two dying declarations of <NAME> one oral and the other written which was recorded by the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police PW on We do not mean to suggest that such dying declarations are always untrustworthy but what we want to emphasize is that better and more reliable methods of recording a dying declarations of an injured person should be taken recourse to and the one recorded by the Police Officer may be relied upon if there was no time of facility available to the prosecution for adopting any better method There is a dying declaration of <NAME> Ext At the direction of the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police PW he recorded the statement of <NAME> at the spot It could not be rejected on the ground that it was recorded by a Police Officer as he was in a critical condition and no other person could be available in the village to record the dying declaration of <NAME> But we find that there is a difficulty in relying upon this dying declaration In all probability they had committed the murder of these two person also because after having raised the Lalkara they went towards the field where <NAME> and <NAME> were We are not impressed with the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the occurrence did not take place at about sun set time or that the First Information Report was ante timed merely because the Illaqa Magistrate received the said report late by a few hours There is no infirmity on that account at all We uphold the sentence of death awarded to appellants <NAME> and <NAME> but set aside the imposition of fine of Rs
