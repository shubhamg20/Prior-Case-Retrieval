The appellant filed on April an application under of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the <ORG> for Special Leave to appeal from the order of the Additional Sessions Judge The <ORG> dismissed the appeal on the ground that the application for special leave to appeal was barred by time It was held that the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure were in the nature of a special law and the provisions of of the Limitation Act were not applicable The appellant came to this Court after getting a certificate of fitness to appeal to this Court A special law means a law enacted for special cases in special circumstances in contra distinction to the general rule of law laid down as applicable generally to all cases with which general law deals When it lays down the bar of time in respect of special cases in special circumstances like those contemplated by and it is a special law contained within the general law Appeal from the judgment and order dated October of <ORG> in Criminal Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> In this appeal on a certificate of fitness granted by <ORG> the only question for determination is whether the provisions of of the Limitation Act apply to an application for special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal under sub of of the Code of Criminal Procedure to be hereinafter referred to as the Code The certificate was granted by <ORG> because there is a considerable conflict of opinion in the various <ORG> The prosecution was launched by a petition of complaint filed by the appellant before the Magistrate The respondent was tried by the Additional Sessions judge Gurdaspur who by his judgment dated December acquitted him on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove that there was a marriage between the complainant and the accused The appellant filed an ap application on April very much later than days from the date of the order of acquittal for special leave to appeal from that order under of the Code When the appeal was placed for hearing before <NAME> and <NAME> JJ a preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the respondent that the appeal was out of time While it was admitted on behalf of the appellant that the appeal was filed long after the period prescribed by sub The Bench pointed out that as a matter of fact no application had been made by the appellant for extension of the period of limitation for filing the petition for special leave In that view of the matter the High <ORG> dismissed the appeal on the ground that the application for special leave to appeal was barred by time Before we refer to the different decisions of the High <ORG>s taking conflicting views on the only question now before us we would examine the relevant provisions of the Code and the Limitation Act If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case in which the offence has been investigated by <ORG> constituted under <ORG> Act XXXV of <ORG> may also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to <ORG> from the order of acquittal If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint and <ORG> on an application made to it by the complainant in this behalf grants special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal the complainant may present such an appeal to <ORG> No application under sub section for the grant of special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal shall be entertained by <ORG> after the expiry of sixty days from the date of that order of acquittal If in any Case the application under sub section for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused no appeal from that order of acquittal shall lit under sub section India It will appear that the section which was recast by Act XXVI of for the first time made provision for an appeal by a private complainant from an order of acquittal if he obtained special leave to appeal from <ORG> Previous to the Amending Act aforesaid it was only <ORG> which could come up in appeal from an order of acquittal The section thus provides for an appeal by <ORG> as also by the complainant in a cast instituted upon a complaint provided that special leave of the <ORG> is obtained Sub section in terms is very precise and mandatory prohibiting <ORG> from entertaining any application for special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal after the expiry of days from the date of such an order On a perusal of the bare provisions of the section and the history of the law on the subject two things are clear namely that the legislature thought it expedient in the interest of justice and public policy that the period of six months allowed to <ORG> to appeal from an order of acquittal should be curtailed by half thus evincing its clear intention to cut short the duration of the litigation which had already resulted in an order of acquittal and that in certain cases <ORG> should have the power of granting special leave to a complainant as distinguished from <ORG> to come up in appeal from an order of acquittal but at the same time indicating in clear and unambiguous terms that such an application must be made within days from the date of the order of acquittal In that sense this rule of days bar is a special law that is to say a rule of limitation which is specially provided for in the Code itself which does not ordinarily provide for a period of limitation for appeals or applications It is the general law of limitation as laid down in the Limitation Act which governs appeals ordinarily preferable under the Code vide Arts It has been observed in some of the cases decided by <ORG> that the Code is not a special or a local law within the meaning of of the Limitation Act that is to say so far as the entire Code is concerned because it is a general law laying down procedure gene rally for the trial of criminal cases The whole Code is indeed a general law regulating the procedure in criminal trials generally but it may contain provisions specifying a bar of time for particular class of cases which are of a special character It is a general law in the sense that it lays down the general rule governing such relationship but it may contain special provisions relating to bar of time in specified cases different from the general law of limitation Such a law will be a special law with reference to the law generally governing the subject matter of that kind of re India lationship A special law therefore means a law enacted for special cases in special circumstances in contradis tinction to the general rules of the law laid down as ap plicable generally to all cases with which the general law deals In that sense the Code is a general law regulating the procedure for the trial of criminal cases generally but if it lays down any bar of time in respect of special cases in special circumstances like those contemplated by read together it will be a special law contained within the general law Once it is held that the special rule of limitation laid down in sub of of the Code is a special law of limitation governing appeals by private prosecutors there is no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that of the Limitation Act is wholly out of the way in view of of the Limitation Act But the question is whether it can be said that even though the provisions of are a special law they prescribe a different period of limitation from that prescribed by the First Schedule of the Limitation Act because applies where there is a difference between the period prescribed by the Limitation Act and that prescribed by the special law It is said that the Limitation Act does not prescribe any period of limitation for an application for special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal at the instance of a private prosecutor Hence it may be said that there is no limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act for an appeal against an order of acquittal at the instance of a private prosecutor Thus there is a difference between the Limitation Act and the rule laid down in of the code in respect of limitation affecting such an application Section is supplemental in its character in so far as it provides for the application of to such cases as would not come within its purview but for this provision And for the purposes of determining any period of limitation prescribed by any special law it has made the provisions of the Limitation Act referred in cl a of sub section of section applicable to such cases to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and cl of that subsection expressly lays it down that the remaining provisions of the Limitation Act shall not apply to cases governed by any special or local law On the other hand earlier decisions of <ORG> at id <ORG> to be presently noticed have taken the view that what we have indicated is the correct view of the legal position They based their conclusion entirely on the wording of sub In <ORG> a Division Bench was of the same opinion as had been held by <ORG> of <ORG> but the decision was obiter because the Court dismissed the petition on the ground that the order of acquittal had been passed before the Amending Act XXVI of came into force so that the order of acquittal was not amenable to an appeal at the instance of the private prosecutor A Single Judge of <ORG> took the view that was applicable to applications for special leave under He also held that there was no difference between the period prescribed by the law of limitation and the Criminal Procedure Code As we agree with the conclusions of <ORG> of Bombay we do not think it necessary to repeat the observations made therein bearing on the reasons given by <ORG>s of Allahabad Andhra Pradesh and Madras for coming to contrary conclusions
