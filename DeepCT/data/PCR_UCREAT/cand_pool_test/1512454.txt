No order was passed on this application On the st November the day fixed for sale <NAME> the appellant in this <ORG> intervened and objected to satisfaction being recorded on the ground that he had purchased the decree from the decree holder by means of a kobala some time before the payment in satisfaction was alleged to have been made by the judgment debtor and that the decree holder could not under such circumstances certify satisfaction He also said that no payment had in fact been made and that the decree holder and judgment debtor were colluding to defeat his right The judgment debtor appealed and the District Judge without coming to any decision on the disputed question of transfer reversed the order of the first <ORG> on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to make any such order under Section of the Procedure Code at the instance of the objector The contention before us is that the Subordinate Judge had full power under Section to make the order which he did make I think the word when used with reference to a decree holder must in the same way include the purchaser of the decree from the decree holder by an assignment in writing and it has been expressly held by <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I All that the purchaser of the decree is the representative of the decree holder within the meaning of Section The only provision in the Code referring expressly to the assignment of a decree is contained in Section and that no doubt contemplates a case in which the assignee applies for execution If however there is an assignment pending proceedings in execution taken by the decree holder I see nothing in the Code which debars the <ORG> from recognising the transferee as the person to go on with the execution He did determine that the decree had been transferred by the kobala and he decided also a question relating to the satisfaction of the decree as between the judgment debtor and the person whom he found to be the representative of the decree holder It is argued for the respondent that the transferee title was not complete as express notice of the transfer had not been given to the judgment debtor The order of the District Judge is set aside and the case remanded to him in order that he may determine all questions arising on the appeal The costs of this appeal will abide the result
