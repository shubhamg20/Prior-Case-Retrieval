Thereafter the <ORG> was prorogued several times <ORG> reconstituted and a fresh notice was issued to the petitioner Held that the general principles of res judicata applied and the judgment of this <ORG> could not be allowed to be reopened and must bind the petitioner and the <ORG> of Bihar and the reconstitution of <ORG> in the meantime could make no difference of the Constitution the petitioner raises almost the same controversy as had been done in Writ Petition No of which was heard and determined by this <ORG> by its judgment dated December and by Writ Petition No of which was heard by this <ORG> on November and but which did not reach the stage of judgment by this <ORG> inasmuch as the petitioner Advocate requested the <ORG> to permit him to withdraw the petition and the <ORG> allowed the prayer and permitted the petitioner to withdraw the petition He also held that the petitioner had the fundamental right to publish the report of the proceedings of the <ORG> This <ORG> further held that <ORG> was entitled to take proceedings for breach of its privileges and it was for the <ORG> itself to determine whether there had in fact been any breach of any of its privileges On January the petitioner received a notice that the case of breach of privilege against him would be considered by <ORG> on February That hearing was postponed from date to date until in August the petitioner filed his petition under Art He contended in that petition that as a citizen of India the petitioner had the fundamental right under Art It was also contended that the first respondent the Chief Minister of Bihar who it was alleged had control over the majority of the members of <ORG> and of <ORG> was proceeding mala fide in getting the proceedings instituted against the petitioner for alleged breach of the privilege of the <ORG> The prayer made in the petition was that the proceedings of <ORG> at its meeting held on August might be quashed and the respondents restrained by a writ in the nature of a writ of prohibition from proceeding against the petitioner in respect of publication aforesaid of the proceedings of <ORG> of May At the instance of some of the members of the <ORG> the Speaker of the <ORG> referred two questions to the Advocate General of Bihar for his opinion on the floor of the <ORG> on October namely whether it was open to the <ORG> to debate on an issue which might be sub judice in view of the writ petition aforesaid filed by the petitioner in the Supreme <ORG> under Art On November the petitioner received a fresh notice from the Secretary of <ORG> opposite party No calling upon the petitioner to show cause on or before December why appropriate action should not be recommended against him for a breach of the privilege of the Speaker and the <ORG> The grounds of attack raise substantially the same questions that were agitated on the previous occasions in this Court It was contended before us that the petitioner as a citizen of India had the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression which included the freedom of obtaining the earliest and most correct intelligence of the events of the time including the proceedings of a <ORG> and publishing the same and that no <ORG> of a State could claim a privilege so as to curtail that right of the Constitution and it was contended that no citizen could be deprived of his personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law Hence it was further contended that the malafide act of respondents and calling upon the petitioner to show cause was a threat to his fundamental right and finally it was contended that after several prorogations the previous proceedings for breach of privilege were dead and <ORG> of the Assembly had therefore no power or jurisdiction to issue the fresh notice in accordance with the motion of November reviving the proceedings In short it is insisted that the petitioner has the fundamental right of publishing the proceedings of <ORG> and that the <ORG> has no power to restrict or control the publication of its proceedings Would it make any difference that though opposite party No is the <ORG> its personnel is different from that of the <ORG> constituted as it was in In our opinion it does not make any difference the matter may have no jurisdiction to try the subsequent suit and even though the subject matter of the dispute was not exactly the same in the two proceedings In that case the rule of res judicata was applied to litigation in land acquisition proceedings In that case the general principles of law bearing on the rule of res judicata and not the provisions of of the Code of Civil Procedure were applied to the case The rule of res judicata is meant to give finality to a decision arrived at after due contest and after hearing the parties interested in the controversy There cannot be the least doubt that though eo nomine opposite party No were not the same but there is no escape from the conclusion that <ORG> is the same <ORG> irrespective of its personnel at a given time so long as it was a <ORG> constituted by the same <ORG> That there was difference of opinion and one of the Judges constituting the <ORG> held another view only shows that there was room for difference of opinion It is manifest therefore that the petitioner has no fundamental right which is being threatened to be infringed by the proceedings taken by the opposite party It now remains to consider the other subsidiary questions raised on behalf of the petitioner There are two answers to this contention firstly that according to the previous decision of this <ORG> the petitioner has not the fundamental right claimed by him Secondly the validity of the proceedings inside <ORG> State cannot be called in question on the allegation that the procedure laid down by the law had not been strictly followed Article of the Constitution is a complete answer to this part of the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner No <ORG> can go into those questions which are within the special jurisdiction of the <ORG> itself which has the power to conduct its own business Possibly a third answer to this part of the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is that it is yet premature to consider the question of procedure as the <ORG> is yet to conclude its proceedings It must also be observed that once it has been held that the <ORG> has the jurisdiction to control the publication of its pro ceedings and to go into the question whether there has been any breach of its privileges the <ORG> is vested with complete jurisdiction to carry on its proceedings in accordance with its rules of business Mere non compliance with rules of procedure cannot be a ground for issuing a writ under Art Mr <NAME> the Government Advocate of Bihar who appeared on behalf of the respondents informed the <ORG> that the <ORG> was interested more in the vindication of its constitutional rights than in inflicting any punishment on the petitioner It remains to consider one other point sought to be made on behalf of the petitioner that the <ORG> had no power to proceed against the petitioner for breach of privilege in May when we know as a fact that the <ORG> was prorogued several times between May and November In our opinion there is no substance in this contention for the simple reason that the prorogation of the <ORG> does not mean its dissolution The observations quoted above do not support the extreme contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that the proceedings in contempt are dead for all time
