HEADNOTE The Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act by i empowered a municipal council to impose in the whole or any part of the municipality a tax payable by the owners of houses buildings or lands situated within the limits of <ORG> with reference to annual letting value of the house building or land called property tax The corresponding provision in <ORG> <ORG> Act was section a and it provided that the <ORG> shall impose a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situated within the city with reference to the gross annual letting value of the building or land called the property tax Sub clause exempted properties owned by or vesting in <ORG> <ORG> or the <ORG> from the levy On June respondent entered into an agreement with the appellant company under which the company agreed to contribute a sum of rupees lakhs annually to the seed capital of the <ORG> in consideration of the <ORG> agreeing not to exercise its power of taxation or of levying any other charges on the assets and activities of the company By a notice issued under section of <ORG> Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam Act of on February and by another notice issued under section of <ORG> Municipalities Act on April the Chief Executive Officer of respondent called upon the company to pay a sum of about Rs In the appeals to this Court it was contended that respondent can exercise only such powers to levy property tax as the <ORG> or the <ORG> had under <ORG> <ORG> Act or <ORG> Municipalities Act as these Acts stood on February when clause was inserted in section of the Act of Section A and section which create and levy the charge of property tax having been inserted in the Municipalities Act and the <ORG> Act respectively with effect from April i subsequent to the insertion of clause in section of the Act of Respondent was incompetent to exercise the powers of the <ORG> or the <ORG> under section A of the <ORG> Act or section of the <ORG> Act that respondent cannot impose the property tax without following the procedure prescribed by section of the Municipalities Act and section of the <ORG> Act that Article of the Constitution envisages that the property of the <ORG> shall save in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide be exempt from all taxes imposed by a <ORG> or by any authority within a <ORG> Section A of <ORG> Municipalities Act and section of <ORG> <ORG> Act also provide that the property tax shall not be leviable on buildings and lands owned by or vesting in <ORG> The lands and buildings on which respondent had imposed the property tax are used for the purposes of and are covered by coal mines Dismissing the appeals HELD i Section of the Act of must be read to mean that respondent shall have all the powers of taxation which a <ORG> or a <ORG> has at the time when respondent seeks to exercise those powers The three Acts are supplemental from which it must follow that amendments made to the earlier Acts after the enactment of section shall have to be read into that section Without recourse to such a construction the power of taxation conferred by that section will become ineffectual iii A reading of the reference to the two earlier Municipal Acts as a reference to those Acts as they stand at the time when the power of taxation is sought to be exercised by respondent will not cause repugnancy between the two earlier Acts on one hand and the Act of on the other nor will it cause any confusion in the practical application of the earlier Acts because the Act of does not contain any independent provision or machinery for exercising the power of taxation iv If an earlier legislation is incorporated into a later legislation the provisions of earlier law which are incorporated into the later law become a part and parcel of the later law A vi The broad principle that where a subsequent Act incorporates provisions of a previous Act then the borrowed provisions become an integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and are totally unaffected by any repeal or amendment in the previous Act is subject to four exceptions one of which is that the principle will not apply to cases where the subsequent Act and the previous Act are supplemental to each other In the instant case subsequent amendments made to the <ORG> Act and the Municipalities Act will also apply to the power of taxation provided for in section of the Act of It provided that for the purpose of taxation the Special <ORG> shall have the powers which a <ORG> or a <ORG> has under <ORG> <ORG> Act or <ORG> Municipalities Act i Section A of the Municipalities Act and section of the <ORG> Act create by their own force the liability to be brought to property tax and the right to levy that tax It is therefore not necessary to follow the procedure prescribed by sections and of the respective Acts i The power conferred by the <ORG> <ORG> on Special Area Development Authorities to impose the property tax on lands and buildings is not in conflict with the power conferred by the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act on <ORG> to regulate and develop coal mines so as to ensure rational and scientific utilisation of coal resources ii The paramount purpose behind the declaration contained in section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act is not in any manner defeated by the legitimate exercise of taxing power under section of the Act of <NAME> for the applicant intervener <ORG> <NAME> for the applicant intervener State of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD These appeals by special leave involve the question of the legality of the demand for Property tax made by respondent on the appellant Companies Since the three appeals raise similar questions we will refer to the facts of Civil Appeal No of only That Act was passed by <ORG> in order to make provision for planning and development and use of land to make better provision for the preparation of development plans and zoning plans with a view to ensuring that town planning schemes are made in a proper manner and their execution is made effective to constitute <ORG> for proper implementation of town and country development plan to provide for the development and administration of special areas through <ORG> to make provision for the compulsory acquisition of land required for the purpose of the development plans and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid Section empowers <ORG> to declare any area as a special area by issuing a notification Section which prescribes the functions of <ORG> lays down by clauses and vi that <ORG> shall make provision for the municipal services and municipal management of the Special Area Since there was no Municipal <ORG> or <ORG> in the Korba Special Area prior to the constitution of <ORG> the Government was required under sub clause above to direct whether the Madhya Pradesh Municipal <ORG> Act or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act shall apply to the Korba Special Area for the purposes of clauses and vi of section and clauses and of section Section i of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act empowers a municipal council to impose in the whole or any part of the municipality a tax payable by the owners of houses buildings or lands situated within the limits of Municipality with reference to annual letting value of the house building or land called property tax It says that the <ORG> shall impose a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situated within the city with reference to the gross annual letting value of the building or land called the property tax For conferring powers to levy tax on the entry of goods in place of octroi tax the Madhya Pradesh Sthaniya Kshetra Me Mal Ke Pravesh Par Kar Adhyadesh of was promulgated Both of these Ordinances were published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette dated April from which date they came into force Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter as and from the financial year there shall be charged levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both situate in a municipality other than class IV municipality at the rate specified in the table below i where the annual letting per centum value exceeds Rs ii iii iv where the annual letting per centum value exceeds of the annual Rs letting value The property tax levied under sub section shall not be leviable in respect of the following properties namely a building and lands owned by or vesting in i <ORG> ii the State Government iii the <ORG> By a notice issued under section of the Act of on February and by another notice issued under section of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act on April the Chief Executive Officer of respondent called upon the <ORG> to pay a sum of Rs lakhs being the amount paid by the <ORG> by way of contribution for the year under the agreement of The appellant Company disputed its liability to pay the aforesaid amounts on the grounds principally that no tax was leviable on its property since the Company was owned wholly by <ORG> and that respondent was estopped from levying the property tax by reason of the agreement of Having failed to persuade respondent to accept its point of view the Company filed Writ Petition in <ORG> asking that the demands be quashed The learned Attorney General who appears on behalf of the appellants has raised four or five principal points any one of which if accepted will result in the success of these appeals It is urged that the provisions conferring powers of taxation under the aforesaid two Acts must be taken to have been incorporated in section of the Act of and any subsequent change in those provisions by amendment of the two Acts cannot be availed of by respondent Relying on this it is argued that respondent was incompetent to exercise the powers of the <ORG> or <ORG> under section A of the Municipalities Act or section of <ORG> Act The answer to this contention will depend mainly upon whether the provisions of the Municipalities Act and the Municipal Corporation Act were incorporated into the Act of by its section It is well settled that if an earlier legislation is incorporated into a later legislation the provisions of earlier law which are incorporated into the later law become a part and parcel of the later law Applying these principles we are of the opinion that in the instant case subsequent amendments made to the Municipal Corporation Act and the Municipalities Act will also apply to the power of taxation provided for in section of the Act of It provides that for the purpose of taxation <ORG> shall have the powers which <ORG> or <ORG> has under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act As observed in <NAME> there is a distinction between a mere reference to or a citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means the bodily lifting of the provisions of one enactment and making them part of another so much so that the repeal of the former leaves the latter wholly untouched Section of the Act of must accordingly be read to mean that respondent shall have all the powers of taxation which <ORG> or <ORG> has for the time being that is to say at the time when respondent seeks to exercise those powers The three Acts are therefore supplemental from which it must follow that amendments made to the earlier Acts after the enactment of section shall have to be read into that section Without recourse to such a construction the power of taxation conferred by that section will become ineffectual A reading of the reference to the two earlier Municipal Acts as a reference to those Acts as they stand at the time when the power of taxation is sought to be exercised by respondent will not possibly cause repugnancy between the two earlier Acts on one hand and the Act of on the other nor indeed will it cause any confusion in the practical application of the earlier Acts because the Act of does not contain any independent provision or machinery for exercising the power of taxation The second contention is that assuming that section A of the Municipalities Act or section of the Municipal Corporation Act which were introduced by an amendment made after the enactment of section can be invoked for levying the property tax respondent cannot impose that tax without following the procedure prescribed by sections and of the aforesaid Acts respectively They provide Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter as and from the financial year there shall be charged levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both at the rate specified in the table below Nothing further is required to be done by the Municipality or <ORG> in order to impose the property tax and therefore the procedure preliminary to the imposition of other taxes which is prescribed by sections and of the two Acts can have no application to the imposition of the property tax Section of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act prescribes the procedure for the imposition of any tax under section Similarly section of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act prescribes the procedure for the imposition of any tax under section It is therefore not necessary to follow the procedure prescribed by sections and of the respective Acts This position is made clear out of abundant caution by clause of section of <ORG> Act which provides that nothing contained in section shall apply to the tax mentioned in clause a of sub section of section which shall be charged and levied in accordance with section The learned Attorney General contends that the taxing authority must all the same apply its mind to the question whether it wants to bring to tax the land or the building or both The obligation which the statute places upon it is to impose tax on lands where there are lands only and they can be taxed on buildings where buildings alone can be brought to tax and on both lands and buildings where lands are built upon and both can be brought to tax Section A of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act and section of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act also provide that the property tax shall not be leviable inter alia on buildings and lands owned by or vesting in the <ORG> Government In <NAME> <ORG> of India The Banks Nationalisation case it was held A company registered under the Companies Act is a legal person separate and distinct from its individual members A shareholder has merely an interest in the <ORG> arising under its Articles of Association measured by a sum of money for the purpose of liability and by a share in the profit On the question as to whether the <ORG> carried on an industry under the authority of <ORG> within the meaning of section a of the Industrial Disputes Act it was held by this Court that an incorporated company has a separate existence and the law recognises it as a juristic person separate and distinct from its members The mere fact that the entire share capital of the respondent company was contributed by <ORG> and the fact that all its shares were held by the President and certain officers of <ORG> did not make any difference to that position In Pennington Company Law th Edition pages it is stated that there are only two decided cases where the court has disregarded the separate legal entity of a company and that was done because the company was formed or used to facilitate the evasion of legal obligations In cases such as those before us there is no scope for applying the doctrine of lifting the veil in order to have regard to the realities of the situation If the lands and building on which respondent has imposed the property tax cannot be regarded as the property of <ORG> for several other purposes like attachment and sale there is no reason why for taxing purposes the property can be treated as belonging to that <ORG> as distinct from the company which has a juristic personality The lands and buildings on which respondent has imposed the property tax are used for the purposes of and are covered by coal mines Basing himself on that consideration the Attorney General argues By virtue of the declaration contained in section of Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act the legislative field covered by Entry List II passed on the <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I The <ORG> enacted the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act for acquisition of coal mines with a view to reorganising and reconstructing such coal mines so as to ensure the rational coordinated and scientific development and utilisation of coal resources as best to subserve the common good Apart from the fact that there is no data before us showing that the property tax constitutes an impediment in the achievement of the goals of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act the provisions of the Act of under which <ORG> are constituted afford an effective answer to the Attorney General contention Entry of List II relates to Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> Entry of List I relates to Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest It is true that on account of the declaration contained in section of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act the legislative field covered by Entry of List II will pass on to <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I But in order to judge whether on that account the State legislature loses its competence to pass the Act of it is necessary to have regard to the object and purpose of that Act and to the relevant provisions thereof under which <ORG> are given the power to tax lands and buildings within their jurisdiction We have set out the objects of the Act at the commencement of this judgment one of which is to provide for the development and administration of Special Areas through <ORG> Section of the Act of which provides for the constitution of the special areas lays down by sub section that Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act or the Madhya Pradesh <ORG>s Act <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> or a <ORG> as the case may be shall in relation to the special area and as from the date <ORG> undertakes the functions under clause or clause vi of section cease to exercise the powers and perform the function and duties which <ORG> is competent to exercise and perform under the Act of Section defines the functions of <ORG> one of which as prescribed by clause is to provide the municipal services as specified in sections and of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act Section which defines the powers of the <ORG> shows that those powers are conferred inter alia for the purpose of municipal administration Surely the functions powers and duties of Municipalities do not become an occupied field by reason of the declaration contained in section of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act Though therefore on account of that declaration the legislative field covered by Entry List II may pass on to the <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I the competence of <ORG> to enact laws for municipal administration will remain unaffected by that declaration Entry of List II relates to Local Government that is to say the constitution and powers of municipal corporations and other local authorities for the purpose of local self Government The power to impose tax on lands and buildings is derived by <ORG> from Entry of List II Taxes on lands and buildings The power of the municipalities to levy tax on lands and buildings has been conferred by the State Legis lature on <ORG> Those authorities have the power to levy that tax in order effectively to discharge the municipal functions which are passed on to them Entry of List I does not contemplate the taking over of municipal functions In that case under the terms of a mining lease the lessee worked the mines and bound himself to pay a dead rent if he used the leased land for the extraction of iron ore and to pay surface rent in respect of the surface area occupied or used by him Those demands were challenged by the lessee on the ground inter alia that the provision imposing the land cess quoad royalty under the mining leases must be held to have been repealed by the Central Act viz This contention was repelled by this Court by holding that sections and of the Madras District Boards Act had nothing to do with the development of mines and minerals or their regulation The power conferred by <ORG> on Special Area Development Authorities to impose the property tax on lands and buildings is therefore not in conflict with the power conferred by the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act on <ORG> to regulate and develop the Coal mines so as to ensure rational and scientific utilisation of coal resources The paramount purpose behind the declaration contained in section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Develop ment Act is not in any manner defeated by the legitimate exercise of taxing power under section of the Act of This Court held that the pith and substance of the amended section fell within Entry although it incidentally touched land and that therefore the amendment was subject to the overriding power of <ORG> as declared in section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act By the aforesaid declaration and the enactment of section the whole of the field relating to minor minerals had come within the jurisdiction of <ORG> and no scope was left for the enactment of the second proviso to section of the Bihar Land Reforms Act The second sub rule added to Rule was held to be without jurisdiction for the same reason It was held by this Court that the Haryana Act was not in any way repugnant to the provisions of the Act of made by <ORG> and that the ownership rights could be validly acquired by the State Government under the State Act It was contended on behalf of the sugar undertakings that since sugar is a declared industry under the Industries Development and Regulation Act <ORG> alone was competent to pass a law on the subject and <ORG> had no competence to pass the impugned Act by reason of Entry List I read with Entry List II The majority speaking through one of us <NAME> held that the legislative power of the <ORG> under Entry List II was eroded only to the extent to which control was assumed by the Union <ORG> pursuant to the declaration made by the <ORG> in respect of a declared industry and that the field occupied by such enactment was the measure of the erosion of the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature Since the Central Act was primarily concerned with the development and regulation of declared industries and not with the ownership of industrial undertakings it was held that the <ORG> legislature had the competence to enact the impugned law Justice <NAME> and Justice <NAME> who gave a separate judgment concurring with the conclusion of the majority preferred to rest their decision on the circumstance that the impugned legislation fell within Entry List III Acquisition and requisition of property and was therefore within the competence of <ORG> In <ORG> an additional point was taken based upon the agreement dated June which was entered into between the appellant <ORG> and respondent
