Although the plaintiff described a part of the claim as her own brohmuttur properties which have devolved upon her by right of inheritance yet it appears from the judgment of the <ORG> below that it was admitted by both parties that the whole of the claim consisted of properties which without a single exception belong to the aforesaid deities We shall therefore consider that the plaintiff in the <ORG> below abandoned her claim upon her own title and was satisfied to rest the whole suit upon her right to recover possession of the disputed properties as shebait or manager on behalf of the aforesaid idols Upon the death of her mother in law the defendant No the father of her husband attempted to take possession of the disputed properties along with the debsbeba At this time there having been a number of documents relating to some of the <NAME> properties in <ORG> of the district the first defendant as the shebait of the idols applied to get them back From these passages it is clear that the gift and acceptance of an only son are strictly prohibited but there is no prohibition against the gift of the eldest son Comparing these paragraphs with the rules laid down in Dattaka Chandrika and Dattaka Mimansa quoted above we do not think that paragraph of Chapter I Section of the Mitakshara ought to be construed so as to render an adoption of the eldest son out of several sons invalid in law It is not so in paragraph which on the other hand has a tendency to indicate that the prohibition as to the gift of the eldest son is not intended to be regarded as a legal prohibition Another contention has boon made in this Court on behalf of the respondent regarding the invalidity of the plaintiff husband adoption which was not raised in the Court below This question of law can only arise upon the establishment of a particular fact which was neither alleged in the <ORG> below nor any issue raised upon it Then we come to the most important question in the case namely who upon the death of the plaintiff husband was entitled to succeed as <ORG> to the <ORG> properties in dispute in this case Without therefore saying that there is anything in the nature of this office which would prevent its being confined to the members of a particular family and being regulated by the ordinary rules of inheritance and without accepting the view taken by the Subordinate Judge that females would by reason of their sex be excluded from the succession we still think that the plaintiff ought to make out clearly that as she asserts she is entitled as heiress of her husband to succeed to the office and to turn out the defendant <NAME> The presumption in her favour from her husband having boon in possession would not apply in this case in the same way and with the same force as if the question were who was to succeed to her husband private estate We may say at once that there is in our opinion no satisfactory evidence before is that the appointments There has been much contention whether as the plaintiff asserts these four daughters succeeded each other as shebaits or whether as the defendant <NAME> asserts their husbands were the shebaits On the other hand there is undoubtedly evidence that the daughters in some cases continued to hold possession of the guddee after the death of their husbands There is no doubt very considerable difficulty in ascertaining what is the true rule of succession to this office
