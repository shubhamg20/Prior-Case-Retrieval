The appeal filed by the respondent before <ORG> was allowed mainly on the ground that as the respondent was not a public servant as contemplated by the provisions of the Act his trial under the Act was without jurisdiction <ORG> took the view that as the Act had incorporated the definition of the Penal Code prior to its amendment it became an integral and independent part of the Act and would remain unaffected by any repeal or change in the previous Act namely the Penal Code In these circumstances it was considered necessary to evolve a quick expeditious and effective machinery to destroy the evil of corruption existing in any form If therefore the Penal Code with the same object enlarged the definition of by adding the twelfth clause by virtue of the Criminal law Amendment Act and the Anti corruption Laws Amendment Act there is no reason why the extended meaning to the provision of of the Act ns borrowed from of the Penal Code be not given lo that section It is against this order of <ORG> that the State of has filed this appeal before us after obtaining certificate of fitness from <ORG> In order of appreciate this point it may be necessary to set out the scheme of the Prevention of Corruption Act hereinafter referred to as the Act with particular reference to of the Indian Penal Code hereinafter referred to as the Penal Code which has been incorporated in the Act <ORG> took the view that as the Act had incorporated the definition of the Penal Code prior to its amendment therefore it became an integral and independent part of the Act and would remain unaffected by any repeal or change in the previous Act namely the Penal Code The question that arises for consideration is whether the sub sequent amendments to of the Penal Code after its incorporation in the Act would have to be read into the Act or not but there is a rule of construction that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute the repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second Craies on Statute Law th Edition while referring to the observations of <NAME> observed at as follows There is a rule of construction that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute the repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second as the incorporated provisions have become part of the second statute It was argued before <ORG> as also before us that the Act and the Penal Code are statutes in pari materia and form part of one system and they should therefore be interpreted as enforcing each other This principle however cannot apply to the present case where as we have already stated the areas of the two statutes namely the Act and the Penal Code are entirely different In these circumstances it was considered necessary to evolve a quick expeditious and effective machinery to destroy the evil of corruption existing in any from If therefore the Penal Code with the same object enlarged the definition of by adding the twelfth clause by virtue of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and the Anti corruption Laws Amendment Act there is no reason why the extended meaning to the provision of of the Act as borrowed from of the Penal Code be not given to that section This can only be done if we give extended meaning to the term public servant as referred to in of the Act by applying the enlarged definition contained in clause inserted in the Penal Code by the two amendments referred to above There is yet another aspect of the matter which is spelt out from the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra which has been relied upon by <ORG> itself as follows It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act no addition to the former Act which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act can be deemed to be incorporated in it at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition On a consideration of these authorities therefore it seems that the following proposition emerges Where a subsequent Act incorporates provisions of a previous Act then the borrowed provisions become an integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and are to tally unaffected by any repeal or amendment in the previous Act This principle however will not apply in the following cases a where the subsequent Act and the previous Act are supplemental to each other where the two Acts are in pari materia where the amendment in the previous Act if not imported into the subsequent Act also would render the subsequent Act wholly unworkable and ineffectual and where the amendment of the previous Act either expressly or by necessary intendment applies the said provisions to the subsequent Act There is yet another aspect of the matter In view of these circumstances therefore we feel the respondent has committed only a technical offence and a token sentence is called for We therefore allow the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> dated April acquitting the respondent
