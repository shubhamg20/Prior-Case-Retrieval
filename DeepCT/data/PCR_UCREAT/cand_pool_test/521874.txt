His Lordship after referring to certain preliminary matters remarked As this appears to be the first case of its kind we may point out that the person who is said to have caused the nuisance should be made a party to the proceedings both in the inquiry which may be made by the Magistrate under Section of the Act and on the appeal in this Court This section enables any person who resides in the City to complain to a Presidency Magistrate of the existence of any nuisance or that in the exercise of any power conferred by Sections or more than the least practicable nuisance has been created Sub section provides that upon receipt of any such complaint the Magistrate after making such inquiry as he thinks necessary may if he sees fit direct the Commissioner to put in force any of the provisions of this Act or to take such measures as to such Magistrate shall seem practicable and reasonable for preventing abating diminishing or remedying such nuisance Purely as a matter of construction there is nothing in the terms of the section to justify the contention that the second part of Clause a of Sub section which relates to the direction to the Municipal Commissioner to take such measures as to such Magistrate shall seem practicable and reasonable applies only to the exercise of the powers under any one of the sections mentioned in Sub section The scheme of the section clearly is to give the right to any person to make a complaint where there is any nuisance or where the exercise of any of the powers conferred by the respective sections more than the least practicable nuisance has been created This section appears to me to have been enacted for the protection of persons residing in the City and it provides a remedy which is open to any resident of the City It provides that the measures for preventing abating diminishing or remedying the nuisance may be taken by directing the Municipal Commissioner to do certain things and the extent of the power of the <ORG> is to be found in the words of Clause a of Sub section namely that the Magistrate may direct him to put in force any of the provisions of the Act or to take such measures as shall seem practicable and reasonable to the Magistrate for preventing abating diminishing or remedying the nuisance That provision undoubtedly implies some limitation upon the powers of the Commissioner and some control over his acts where a proper case for giving directions to him in connection with a nuisance is made out I am quite satisfied that there is no substance in the arguments urged by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the Municipal Commissioner as to the construction of the section I am not speaking of the powers under Clause of Sub section as to which no point is raised in appeal As regards the order to be made under the section the question is more difficult As regards the owner from the beginning he had knowledge of the fact that the residents in this house which belongs to him were opposed to the putting up of these stables He is also the owner of the house in which the applicant lives It may be said fairly on his behalf that when the matter has gone so far whether any measures less drastic than those allowed by the lower Court would not be sufficient to meet the justice of the case From this presumption it is not allowable to depart where the language admits of no other meaning If there is nothing to modify nothing to alter nothing to qualify the language which the statute contains it must be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences I have read and re read Section and I find no difficulty in understanding it Upon receipt of such complaint the Magistrate after making such inquiry as he thinks fit may direct the Commissioner to put in force any of the provisions of this Act or to take such measures as to such Magistrate may seem practicable and reasonable for preventing abating diminishing or remedying such nuisance By that Act also a <ORG> of summary jurisdiction is empowered to deal with nuisance of either sort on information given by any person aggrieved thereby vide Section In view of the plain language used it is not possible to attribute any other intention to the local legislature nor can I follow the argument that any assistance is to be derived from the other sections of the local Act which were brought to our notice The words used in Section are which is or may be dangerous to life or injurious to health But there is one salient fact upon this matter and that is that there is no proof that a single anopheles mosquito either larva or perfect insect has been traced to these stables But there is one further source of danger which is disclosed by the evidence which demands consideration There is evidence that this is so were evidence required and Dr <NAME> says Flies are commonly said to be carriers of a number of diseases The nuisance here is more formidable for we have a stable of horses as against one of and the neighbourhood here is of a better class and approximates more closely to those select residential quarters outside what may be called the native limits which in the opinion of the learned Judge in <NAME> case stand on a somewhat different footing I have already indicated that the supposed utility of these stables is not a matter which we can consider a view which is also emphatically expressed by <NAME> in the judgment cited
