It is unnecessary to set out the facts of the case elaborately and it will be sufficient to confine the facts in so far as they are relevant to the disposal of the contentions that have been raised in this appeal It has now been finally decided by <ORG> that this Act as it then stood does not operate to regulate succession to agricultural land in the Governors Provinces and also that it does not operate to regulate devolution by survivorship of such agricultural land The learned Subordinate Judge decreed a share in these items on the ground that the rights to property should be determined as on the date on which the plaintiff claimed a share by instituting the present suit for partition of the items and not as on the date of the death of her husband Under the Act as it would be seen from the language of Section the right is created in favour of the widow of a deceased coparcener in the property governed by the Act her interest being the same as that of her husband The reasoning therefore of the learned Judge on the basis of which he granted the decree for partition of these items of the second schedule to the plaint seems to lis to be entirely wrong The contention however that the money that was collected after the death of <NAME> by his widow became property in which the son widow acquired an interest under the provisions of Section of the Act was not raised and if the argument that the rights should be determined as on the date of partition was permissible even if it was not raised their Lordships of <ORG> would not have omitted to consider and give effect to it However on the plain language of Section of the Act we have no hesitation in holding that the rights should be determined whether claimed by succession or survivorship as on the date of the death of the husband of the plaintiff and not on the date of the partition suit The learned Subordinate Judge on the evidence before him found that the first defendant failed to establish that the house which stands in his name and which was purchased in was acquired without the aid of the joint family funds The burden is entirely upon him to show by clear and cogent evidence that the property was acquired by his separate funds There is also another contention relating to the pledge of jewels and it is alleged that the pledge really belongs to the sixth defendant The sixth defendant himself has not appealed against the finding of the learned Subordinate Judge and the case of the first defendant rests entirely upon the oral testimony of himself and of the sixth defendant For reasons given by the learned Subordinate Judge in paragraph of the judgment we see no reason to differ from his conclusion on the point In the result the appeal is allowed to the extent of directing the exclusion of items and of Schedule II to the plaint from partition
