It was made clear that if the directions of this Court were not complied with the Chief Secretary would run the risk of being sentenced Having sought time for years to appoint a Commission <ORG> then suddenly came forward with the Kerala State Backward Classes Reservation of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State Act which in section declared that having regard to known facts in existence in the State of Kerala that there are no socially advanced sections in any Backward Classes who have acquired capacity to compete with forward classes and that the Backward classes in the State were not adequately represented in the services under the State and they would continue to be entitled to reservation under Clause of Article of the Constitution Thereafter objections were filed in this Court by various parties to the said report and that is how the matter has come before us We have heard arguments of <NAME> learned senior counsel as Amicus Curiae and of Sri <NAME> learned senior counsel who contended that the Kerala Act was unconstitutional and violative of Articles and Under Article there is a prohibition that <ORG> shall not discriminate against any citizen on the grounds only of religion race caste sex and place of birth or any of them Article empowers the <ORG>s for making any provision for reservation in appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> The scope of judicial scrutiny even with regard to matters relating to subjective satisfaction are governed by the principles stated in <ORG> Supple Likewise periodic examination of a Backward class could lead to its exclusion if it ceases to be socially backward or if it is adequately represented in the services We shall next proceed to the question relating to creamy layer In <NAME> on the question of exclusion of creamy layer from the Backward Classes there was agreement among eight out of the nine learned Judges of this <ORG> There were five separate Judgments in this behalf which required the creamy layer to be identified and excluded The said judgment laid emphasis on the relevance of caste and also stated that upon a member of the backward class reaching an advanced social level or status he would no longer belong to the backward class and would have to be weeded out This is what the learned Judge declared There are sections among the backward classes who are highly advanced socially and educationally and they constitute the forward section of that community There is to be constituted a body which can go into these questions para as follows We direct that such a body be constituted both at Central level and at the level of the <ORG> within four months from today For example if there are a dozen named backward classes and each have particular percentage of quota in the reservation they can be arranged in a vertical distribution one after the other see para of <NAME> referring to vertical and horizontal divisions and the separate and the aggregate quota meant for them can be spelled out We shall examine the validity of sections and in the light of the above principle In the context of the law laid down in <NAME> and in <NAME> if the legislature of any State does not take steps to remove the defect or to effectively and realistically remove the defect to exclude the creamy layer from the backward classes then the benefits of reservations which are invalidly continued in favour of the creamy layer cannot be declared retrospectively valid merely by a legislative declaration that such creamy layer is absent as done by section of the Kerala Act Nor can it be done by means of the validating provision contained in section of that Act If under the guise of elimination of the creamy layer the legislature makes a law which is not indeed a true elimination but is seen by the <ORG> to be a mere cloak then the <ORG> will necessarily strike down such a law as violative of principle of separation of powers and of Articles and Article While dealing with these Acts this <ORG> referred to the fact that pursuant to <NAME> the Government of India had appointed a Commission presided over by a retired Judge of <ORG> and on the basis of the Report of the Commission it had issued an office Memorandum dated designating A Children of holders of Constitutional posts like a President of India Vice President of India Judges of <ORG> and <ORG> Chairman and Members of <ORG> and <ORG> Chief Election Commissioner Comptroller and Auditor General of India Persons holding constitutional positions of like nature Service category children of a parents Group A Class I officers of <ORG> and State Services direct recruits where both or one of the parents are Class I officers subject to certain conditions children of Group Class II officers of <ORG> direct recruitment subject to certain conditions children of employees of Public Sector Undertakings Banks Insurance Organisations Universities etc The Court observed that the States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had acted in a wholly arbitrary fashion and in utter violation of the law laid down in <NAME> case iv The Validity of the Kerala Act We shall now take up the question as to the validity of the law enacted by <ORG> We shall refer initially to the provisions contained in the six sections of the Kerala Act ii It extends to the whole of the State of Kerala Declaration It is hereby declared having regard to known facts in existence in the State a that there are no socially advanced sections in any Backward Classes who have acquired capacity to compete with forward classes and that the Backward Classes in the <ORG> are still not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> and they continue to be entitled to reservation under clause of Article of the Constitution Pursuant to that notice on the State of Kerala filed an affidavit stating that it had already passed the Kerala Act on appointing a <ORG> which could go into this issue but that the said <ORG> stated that it had no jurisdiction to go into the question of creamy layer as per the provisions in that Act of The above explanation was naturally found to be wholly unsatisfactory and this Court held in its order dated that the State of Kerala represented by its Chief Secretary had acted in wilful disobedience of the orders of this Court and that it had committed contempt of Court It appears that there was then a <ORG> meeting on that thereafter it was decided on that <ORG> should go into the question but that instead it was suddenly decided on that the existing system be continued The Act received the assent of the Governor on and became effective retrospectively from thus allowing existing reservations to continue with full force <NAME> <NAME> as he then was observed The <ORG> can tear the veil to decide the real nature of the statute if the facts and circumstances warrant such a course <NAME> said that if the legislation was merely a pretence and the object was discrimination the validity of the statute could be examined by the <ORG> notwithstanding the declaration made by the <ORG> and the learned Judge referred to <NAME> vs The <NAME> AC and to Attorney General vs <NAME> Inswane Co We shall therefore have to examine whether the legislative declaration in section of the Act that there is in effect no creamy layer in the State of Kerala is one made by ignoring facts which do exist We shall now refer to various facts and circumstances as they exist to disprove the statement made in section of the Act a The Kerala <ORG> initially requested this Court for extension of time to appoint a <ORG> to identify the creamy layer It in fact created a statutory <ORG> by Kerala Act of and asked the said <ORG> constituted under that Act to go into the above question The <ORG> it is true refused to go into this question stating that it had no jurisdiction to go into the said question under that Act It is obvious and is not denied that between and the <ORG> gathered no fresh material to compel the <ORG> to abandon the idea and to suddenly turn around and declare that there was in effect no creamy layer in the <ORG> of Kerala In addition the doubts if any in this behalf are set at rest by the findings contained in the Report of the High Level Committee headed by Justice <NAME> to which we shall refer in detail under points and In the judgment of six learned Judges in <NAME> as stated earlier there is a specific declaration of law that the children of <ORG> <ORG> and other <ORG> in the Backward Classes are creamy layer and this is true without further inquiry Further in <NAME> it was held as a matter of law that certain broad categories mentioned in the of the Central Govt There was no answer from the State of Kerala as to why the same categories as mentioned in <NAME> or those mentioned in the as approved in <NAME> could not be declared as creamy layer subject to any realistic modification of the income or holding levels if need be If <ORG> and <ORG> meant in their declaration in sub clause a of section that there was in effect no creamy layer in the <ORG> of Kerala among the notified Backward classes then they must go to the length of stating that there was none who had so far been recruited to the aforementioned services of <ORG> <ORG> etc In fact when this question was specifically put across to the learned senior counsel for the <ORG> and to learned senior counsel for the <ORG> <NAME> and others there was no answer and they could not deny the existence of the above horizontal divisions among the backward classes in Kerala It appears to us therefore from what we have stated above in sub paras a to that the Kerala Act had shut its eyes to realities and facts and it came forward with a declaration in sub clause a of Section which perhaps it was mistakenly believed was not amenable to judicial scrutiny In view of the facts and circumstances referred to above we hold that the declaration in sub clause a of section made by the legislature has no factual basis in spite of the use of the words known facts The declaration in section a is in addition contrary to the principles laid down by this Court in <NAME> and in <NAME> viii Sub clause of section Inadequate representation Section mixes up two different concepts Sub clause of section states that there is no adequate representation of the backward classes in the services of the State of Kerala Article it will be seen is an enabling provision which permits the <ORG> to provide reservation for Backward Classes if in the opinion of the <ORG> such reservation is felt necessary and if there is inadequate representation The question is whether assuming that once the creamy layer is excluded from backward classes the non creamy layer in that backward class is not able to secure adequate representation even within the quota in public services because its members are not reaching the prescribed level of qualification or standards for recruitment can that be a ground for non exclusion of the creamy layer as contended by the <ORG> It is true there is no specific constitutional provision in relation to the need for maintenance of efficiency of administration so far as backward classes are concerned such as the special provision in Article in the case of Schedule castes and Schedule Tribes Further though there is no specific provision in regard to Backward Classes the same principle underlying Article is applicable to Backward classes The crucial words of the section are having regard to the social and educational backwardness of the backward classes in the State of Kerala as in force on the date of the commencement of the Act i Now backward classes have been defined in the Act as those referred to in section of the Act Obviously <ORG> is having <NAME> and <NAME> in its mind when it inserted the non obstante clause <NAME> C<NAME> laid stress on the basic features enumerated in the preamble to the Constitution and said that there were other basic features too which could be gathered from the Constitutional scheme para A of SCC Equality was one of the basic features referred to in the Preamble to our Constitution Else there is no reason why the State should decide not to exclude the creamy layer Points and We have already referred to the circumstances under which this Court was compelled to appoint a High Level <ORG> presided over by Justice <NAME> for the purpose of identifying the creamy layer in <ORG> in the State of Kerala The Subjects committee of the <ORG> and other <ORG>s and the organisations which contended that there was no creamy layer in <ORG> in the State relied mostly upon section of the Act Organisations which contended that there was a creamy layer pointed out that the declaration made in section of the Act was contrary to existing facts and that the <ORG> and the <ORG> had no material before them to declare that there was no creamy layer in the State of Kerala nor to say that no section of any Backward Classes reached a successful level of competition with forward classes We shall initially refer to part I of the report briefly There was an increase of in the index it was stated Annexure IX i deals with departments where there is over representation of some of the Backward Classes In fact there is now an upward increase of income to Rs lakhs In fact in the affidavit dated filed by the Kerala <ORG> through its Chief Secretary it was stated merely that there were a few mistakes namely that there was an omission of communities viz We have heard submissions on behalf of the various communities interveners and looked into their objections to the <ORG> Report We therefore hold that there is nothing in the objections filed the parties which requires to be specifically dealt with It will be obligatory to implement the Report as so modified in the Government Departments of Kerala Organisations Institutions Public Sector Undertakings Government owned Companies Co operative Societies Autonomous Bodies as stated in the Report wherever the principles of reservation embodied in Article or Rules to of Part II of the Kerala State and subordinate Service Rules are applicable Any violation of this direction will make the appointment or selection made on or after this day unconstitutional It is made clear that any infraction of this direction will be treated seriously and this Court will also not hesitate to take further fresh action for contempt of Court if need be We therefore permit the State of Kerala to make such provision as it may deem fit for exclusion of creamy layer among the Backward Classes in the State of Kerala in accordance with law and in a manner consistent with the Constitution the basic structure of the Constitution Articles and and the judgment in <NAME> and in <NAME> and in accordance with the principles laid down in the judgment now rendered by us Once such provision is made and published in accordance with law it shall come into force and the recommendations of <ORG> as accepted by this <ORG> shall cease to apply
