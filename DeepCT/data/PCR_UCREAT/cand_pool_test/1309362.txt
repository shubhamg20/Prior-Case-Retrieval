Briefly the duty of excise is levied on goods and not on a person To ensure this Rule lays down that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced or manufactured until the Excise Duty leviable thereon has been paid at such a place and in such a manner as is prescribed in these Rules and except on the presentation of an application in the proper from and on obtaining the permission of the proper officer on the form Section empowers <ORG> to frame rules to carry into effect the purposes of the Act Section says that all Rules and Notifications issued under the Act shall have effect as if enacted in the Act Relying on the working of this system the Excise authorities issued instructions to the users of the re rollable scrap that they need not follow the usual procedure under Rule of the Rules The authorities thereupon issued a notice of demand to the petitioner asking it to pay the Excise Duty on bars and rods as stated in the First Schedule against sub item i a of Item No AA But according to him it was a condition of the exemption that the raw materials from which these goods were manufactured by the petitioner should have discharged the full liability of the end product duty The petitioner appealed to the Collector Central Excise who dismissed the appeal on as per Annexure to the writ petition purporting Under Rule of the Rules The writ petition is resisted by <ORG> and by the Excise Authorities on the ground that the petitioner was entitled to exemption from payment of the Excise Duty only if the Excise Duty had been recovered on the re rollable scrap from <ORG> The answer to question No depends on the correct construction of the language of the Notification No It is admitted that the goods manufactured by the petitioner were made from re rollable scrap As the petitioner has no knowledge whether <ORG> paid the duty or not the assertion of the respondent may be taken to be true The condition was that the Excise Duty should actually have been paid on the re rollable scrap before the exemption applied to the goods manufactured by the petitioner <NAME> the learned counsel stressed the words has already been paid Section of the Act levies the duty on goods and not on person That is to say that the duty is leviable on good produced or manufactured and not on other goods It further states that the duty is to be collected in such a manner as may be prescribed SULEKH RAM AND SONS I Jf The manner is laid down inter alia in Rule which says that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced or manufactured until Excise Duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed and except on proper form and obtaining the permission of the proper officer on the form More detailed provisions are contained in Chapter of the Rules Under Rule the Collector may require the manufacturer to make prior declaration of the factory premises in which the goods are to be manufactured Rule lays down the procedure for payment of duty after which the permission to remove them would be granted by the Collector Note was taken of the <ORG> decision in re the Central Provinces and Berar Act XIV of holding that though the primary and fundamental meaning of an Excise Duty is that it is a tax on articles produced and manufactured yet there is no reason in theory why Excise Duty should not be imposed even oil the retail sale of an article if the taxing Act so provides But as observed by the Lord <NAME> in Governor General in Council Province of Madras consistently with this decision of the <ORG> referred to above their Lordships are of opinion that a duty of excise is primarily a duty levied on a manufacturer or producer in respect of the commodity manufactured or produced It was held therefore that the duty of excise could be levied on the manufacturer retrospectively even after he had parted with the goods and he would have no opportunity to include the Excise Duty in the price of the goods which he had already Sold We may therefore conclude that according to the procedure laid down in the Act and the Rules for the levy and collection of the Excise Duty the incidence of the Excise Duty is on the manufacturer or the producer and not on the person to whom the manufacturer or the producer sells the goods in much as such a purchaser is in the position of a consumer vis a vis the manufacturer In the present case therefore the incidence of the Excise Duty on re rollable scrap was on <ORG> who manufactured it and not on the petitioner who purchased it If the Excise Duty on the re rollable scrap was payable only by <ORG> namely the manufacturer and never by flick petitioner namely purchaser what would be the meaning to be attached to the word already in the Notification granting the exemption If this word is used to mean actually then the exemption would not be available to the petitioner in the present case This system secures that in all cases Excise Duty is recovered from the manufacturer before the goods are removed from the factory premises The exemption authorities issued instructions to purchasers of re rollable scrap that goods manufactured by such purchasers from re rollable scrap could be removed from the premises of such purchasers without observing the procedure prescribed by Rules Nor can it be said that there could be any uncertainty about the liability of the re rollable scrap in the hands of <ORG> There was a clear distinction between rails usable for Railway tracks and other rails There was therefore no difficulty either for <ORG> or for the Excise Officers to levy duty on latter and exempt from duty the former kind of rails In this context therefore would construe the notification exempting the goods manufactured by the petitioner should have been such on which the goods were manufactured by the petitioner should have been such on which the proper amount of duty of excise ought to have been paid at a stage prior to the use of the re rollable scrap by the petitioner Let us consider the second question on the assumption that the benefit of exemption was not available to the petitioner Absolutely no explanation is given by the respondent why the duty was not recovered from <ORG> as soon as they came to know that it had not been paid by <ORG> Rule could not be applied for the recovery of the duty from <ORG> Steel as there was no possibility of the re rollable scrap being clandestinely removed from the factory of <ORG> which is a respectable Government Undertaking In view none of these two rules are available to the respondents for the recovery of duty from the petitioner on goods manufactured by the petitioner and falling under Item No AA ia of the First Schedule Rule requires that the manufacturer or the producer should make the necessary application for the permission to remove the goods from his premises after payment of duty It is true that in <NAME> I case the petitioner had made an application under Rule and the Excise Officer had assessed the goods to Nil duty There is an additional reason why Rule cannot apply The goods manufactured by the petitioner were excisable goods before the issue of Notification No exempting them from payment of duty Rule as well as the exemption Notification shall have effect as if enacted in this Act For finding out the true scheme of a taxing measure we have to take into consideration not merely the levy but also the exemptions granted On this observation it is arguable that the goods manufactured by the petitioner cease to be excisable goods after they were exempted from payment of duty If the Act and the <ORG> are read together the effect is the goods manufactured by the petitioner were taken out of the First Schedule and therefore were not excisable goods within the meaning of Section The writ petition is therefore allowed and the demand notices Nos dated th April and dated th May issued against the petitioner and the orders dated th July by <ORG> th November by the Collector and th August by the Assistant Collector are quashed In the circumstances I make no order as to costs
