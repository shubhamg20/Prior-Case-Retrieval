Patiala and East Punjab States Union General Provisions Administra tion Ordinance XVl of Union of States Law relating to Income tax Uniform law introduced in all States from August Provision that pending proceedings shall be governed by existing law Assessment at different rates in different States Equality of law Infringement of fundamen tal right Assessment of income which accrued before August Legality Fundamental right not to be deprived of property save under authority of law Whether applies to taxation Scope of Arts Kapurthala there was a law of income tax in force on the said date the rate of tax payable under which was lower than that payable under the Patiala Income tax Act and in another Covenanting State Nabha there was no law of income tax at all of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the assessment on the ground i that he had been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Art of the Constitution inasmuch as he was assessed at a higher rate than that at which asses sees of Kapurthala were assessed ii that as the Ordi nance bringing the Patiala Income tax Act into force in Nabha was enacted only on August it cannot operate retrospectively and authorise the levy of tax on income which had accrued in the year ending April and therefore he was threatened with infringement of the funda mental right guaranteed by Art of the Constitution that no one shall be deprived of his property save under authority of law Held i that the discrimination if any between the assessees of Kapurthala and Nabha was not brought about by the Ordinance but by the circumstance that there was no income tax law in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees and in any case the provision that pending proceedings should be concluded according to the applicable at the time when the right is or liabilities accrued and the proceedings com menced was a reasonable law rounded upon reasonable classi fication of the assessees which is permissible under the equal protection clause ii that as there is a special provision in Art not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution it could not be enforced under Art The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by DAS This is an application under article of the Constitution for appropriate orders for the protection of what the petitioner claims to be his fundamental rights guaranteed by articles and There is no serious controversy as to the facts material for the purposes of this application The proviso to clause of that Article runs as follows Provided that until a Constitution framed by <ORG> comes into operation after receiving the assent of <NAME> <NAME> shall have power to make and promulgate Ordinances for the peace and good government of the Union or any part thereof and any Ordi nance so made shall for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation have the like force of law as an Act passed by <ORG> any such Ordinance may be controlled or superseded by any such Act It may be mentioned here that prior to that date there was no law in the Nabha State imposing income tax on the subjects of that State As from the appointed day all laws and rules regulations bye laws and notifications made thereunder and all other provisions having the force of law in Patiala State on the said day shall apply mutatis mutandis to the territories of the Union and all laws in force in the other Covenanting States immediately before that day shall cease to have effect Provided that all suits appeals revisions applica tions reviews executions and other proceedings or any of them whether Civil or Criminal or Revenue pending in the <ORG> and before authorities of any Covenanting States shall notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proceedings in force in any such Covenanting State immedi ately before the appointed day There was a section providing for adaptation similar to section of the Ordinance of There was another Ordinance to which reference has to be made namely Ordinance No of called the Finance Ordinance promul gated on April which came into force on that very date For the assessment year beginning on the st day of Baisakh that is to say in respect of the accounting the income profits and gains of the previous year ending on the last day of Chet a income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance and rates of super tax shall for the purposes of sec tion of the Patiala Income Tax Act be specified in Part II of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance It is in this setting that the facts leading to the present petition have to be considered The petitioner is a resident of <ORG> in the district of Mohindargarh now in <ORG> but which formerly formed part of the Nabha State On October the petitioner was served with a notice under sections and of the <ORG> Income Tax Act requiring him to submit a return for the Income Tax year to disclosing his income during the previous year to The petitioner on December filed his return for the year and on February he was assessed to income tax On May the petitioner received a notice under section calling upon him to file his return for the year ending the last day of Chet i for the year to On August the petitioner filed his present petition before this Court under article of the Constitution praying that a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari be issued for quashing the assessments of the petitioner income accrued in the years and and other ancillary reliefs The contention of the petitioner in the first place is that he has been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and the equal protection of the laws guaran teed to him by article of the Constitution It is there stated that for the assessment year in Kapurthala the assessees whose cases were pending on August were assessed under the Kapurthala Income Tax Act at rates fixed thereunder but that for the assess ment year the provisions of the <ORG> Income Tax Act and the rates prescribed thereunder were uniformly applied in all areas of the <ORG> including Kapurthala This alle gation which is not denied in the affidavit filed by the petitioner in reply must be taken as correct The discrimination if any was not brought about by the two Ordinances but by the circumstance that there was no Income Tax Act in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees Dr <NAME> appearing in support of the petition next contends that the administration of Nabha <ORG> having been taken over by the Raj Pramukh only on August and the Patiala law including the Patiala Income Tax Act having been brought into operation on and from August the assessment of the tax on the petitioner income which accrued prior to August was wholly illegal and not authorised by the said Ordinances and the <ORG> by insisting on collecting the tax so illegally assessed was threatening to invade the petitioner fundamental right to property guaranteed by article of the Constitution Article runs as follows No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law There was no similar provision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation of property within the meaning of article then there was no point in making a sepa rate provision again as has been made in article In our opinion the protection against imposition and collec tion of taxes save by authority of law directly comes from article and is not secured by clause of article In the view we have taken namely that the protection against imposition or collection of taxes save by authority of law is secured by article and not by article the questions urged by Dr <NAME> do not really arise and it is not necessary to express any opinion on them on this application In our judgment this application fails on the simple ground that no fundamental right of the petitioner has been infringed either under article or under article and we accordingly dismiss the petition with costs
