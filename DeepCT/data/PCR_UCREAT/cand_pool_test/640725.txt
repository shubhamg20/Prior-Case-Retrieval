Proceedings were initiated against the petitioner under the Act and the competent authority passed an order of eviction The petitioner then filed a Civil Suit which was dismissed for default of appearance the petitioner has challenged the constitutional validity of the Act on the ground that <ORG> does not have the legislative competence to legislate on the subject Dismissing the writ petition it was HELD In the present petition the petitioner has contended that since the subject matter falls squarely under PG NO PG NO Entry of List II <ORG> List and it does not fall under any Entry under List I or List III the <ORG> has no competence to legislate in respect of the subject matter Since this specific aspect was not debated before the Constitution Bench it would not be proper to shut out the petitioner from raising the plea by recourse to the argument that the point was concluded in <NAME> case A The Public Premises Act is concerned with the eviction of those persons who have no authority in law to remain in possession of the land belonging to the Union of India The unauthorised persons may be squatters persons having no rights whatsoever or persons who were in occupation by virtue of any agreement but whose right under the agreement had come to an end In so far as the legislation for providing a speedy procedure for eviction of an unauthorised occupant of public premises is concerned it is not shown that there is any legislation enacted by the <ORG> legislature which deals with this subject in so far as the property belonging to the Union of India is concerned Since there is no such legislation the legislation enacted by the <ORG> under the PG NO authority of entry of List cannot be successfully assailed Even if there was such a legislation the Act enacted by the <ORG> would prevail Therefore there is no question of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act prevailing vis a vis the Public Premises Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants Act The source of authority can thus in any case be traced to Entry read with Entry of List I of the Constitution of India Of course the epicentre of the present challenge has shifted and is now located in the plea that <ORG> does not have the legislative competence to legislate on the subject of the impugned legislation which dimension was not in focus in <NAME> case The competent authority passed an order of eviction against the petitioner This <ORG> refused to grant special leave and dismissed petitioner Special Leave Petition Petitioner even so filed a Civil Suit which came to be dismissed for default of appearance Meanwhile the petitioner had approached this court by way of a Special Leave Petition against an interlocutory order passed by <ORG> When the matter came up for hearing this <ORG> issued a Rule Nisi limited to the question of constitutionality of the Act as is evident from the relevant part of the order extracted hereinbelow Application for amendment allowed The scheme of the Act as set out in <NAME> case is as under The scheme of the Act is that it confers power on Estate Officer to issue notice to persons who are in unauthorised occupation of any public premises to show cause why an order of eviction should not be made The notice to show cause against order of eviction shall specify the grounds on which the order of eviction is proposed to be made It is contended that <ORG> in <NAME> case has already pronounced that the legislature had the legislative competence to enact the impugned Act The legislature had legislative competence to enact the Act of the Act provided only one procedure for ejectment of all persons in unauthorised occupation of the public premises or whether there was the further option to make recourse to the ordinary law While it is true that in <NAME> case it has in terms been stated that the concerned legislature that is to say the <ORG> has legislative competence to enact the impuged Act as is evident from the passage extracted hereinabove it is equally true that the legislative competence of the <ORG> to enact the Act does not appear to have been debated at all before the court as is evident from the circumstances that there is no discussion whatsoever as to under which entry of which List the subject matter of the Act would fall In the present matter the petitioner has contended that the subject matter does not fall under any entry either in List I union list or List III Concurrent List but it squarely falls under entry of the List Il PG NO that is to say the State List It has been argued that since the subject matter falls squarely under the State List List II and it does not fall under any entry under List I or List III the <ORG> has no competence to legislate in respect of the subject matter Since this specific aspect was not debated before <ORG> it would not be proper to shut out the petitioner from raising the plea by recourse to the argument that the point was concluded in <NAME> case regardless of whether the matter was debated or not Accordingly we will deal with this point in the light of the submissions urged before us bearing in mind that <ORG> has categorically observed that the <ORG> has legislative competence to enact the Act albeit in the absence of any debate on this point The scheme of the Act shows that apart from the dictionary of terms and expressions used in the Act the vital provisions of the Act pertain to eviction of unauthorised occupants in exercise of powers conferred by Section after following the procedure under Section The incidental provisions are with regard to the disposal of the property left in the public premises by the unauthorised occupants and recovery of arrears referable to the point of time prior to the occupation becoming unauthorised and damages in respect of the period of unauthorised occupation as provided in Section And Section provides for the appeals Section excludes the jurisdiction of <ORG> There are similar provisions in regard to incidental and ancillary matters In any view of the matter PG NO it is not open to contend that the subject matter of the legislation is other than the designing of speedy procedure for eviction of persons in unauthorised occupation of public premises and incidental matters in view of the law declared by <ORG> of this Court in <NAME> case It has to be realised that if the subject matter of the legislation falls under List I <ORG> will have jurisdiction to legislate on the subject having regard to the mandate embodied in Article of the Constitution of India which provides that the <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule We must therefore address ourselves to the issue as to whether the subject matter of the legislation falls in any of the entries in the Union List List I Notwithstanding anything in clauses and Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List In so far as the legislation for providing a speedy procedure for eviction of an unauthorised occupant of public premises is concerned it is not shown that there is any legislation enacted by <ORG> which deals with this subject in so far as the property belonging to the Union of India is concerned Nor has it been contended before us that there is any legislation for eviction of unauthorised occupants enacted by <ORG> which deals with the aforesaid subject matter or that the properties belonging to the Union of India are covered of any such State Act Since there is no such legislation the legislation enacted by the <ORG> under the authority of Entry of List I cannot be successfully assailed even if there was such a legislation the Act enacted by the <ORG> would prevail as per proposition Nos and which have emerged on the analysis of Entry made a short while ago In the second place the Act does not apply to property which is the property of the Government having regard to the provision contained in Section a Since the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act does not apply to the property of the Government there is no question of the said Act prevailing vis a vis the Central Act It deals merely with eviction of tenants from premises owned by landlords other than the Government Under the circumstances there is no question of the Madhya Once the conclusion is reached that the legislation falls under Entry of List I it is unnecessary to examine the scope of Entry of List III pertaining to land that is to say rights in or over land tenures including the relationship of land lord tenant and the collection of rents transfer and alienation of agricultural land land improvement agricultural lands and acquisitions persons having no rights whatsoever or persons who were in occupation by virtue of any agreement but whose right under the agreement had come to an end Thus there is no substance in the contention that the <ORG> had no legislative competence to enact Public Premises Act This contention was raised before <ORG> in <NAME> case and has been repulsed by <ORG> on the reasoning unfolded in the passage extracted from paragraph of the judgment The first contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the Act in so far as it includes in the definition of public premises any premises belonging to or taken on lease by or on behalf of any company as defined in of the Companies Act in which not less than of the paid up share capital is held by <ORG> is ultra vires and void as to that extent the Act is beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> It seems however more appropriate that in so far as the Act deals with a lessee or licensee of premises belonging to a <ORG> company the subject matter of the Act would be covered by Entries and of List III PG NO Learned counsel for the Petitioner has not been able to show that there is any infirmity in the reasoning of <ORG> We therefore concur with the conclusion reached by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and repel the challenge unhesitatingly
