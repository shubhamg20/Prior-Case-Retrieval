DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> MAJMUDAR CITATION JT ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT MAJMUDAR I have gone through the judgment prepared by my esteemed learned Brother <NAME> I respectfully agree with the conclusion to the effect that respondents nos and had missed the bus by adopting an indolent attitude in not challenging the acquisition proceedings promptly However I may mention at this stage that observations made by my learned brother <NAME> In connection with utilisation of land acquired under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act hereinafter referred to as the Act for one public purpose to be used for another public purpose are with great respect not found by me to be apposite Even though the proposal under Section is for acquisition of land for a specified public purpose if the planning authority wants to acquire the land subsequently for any other public purpose earmarked in the modified scheme as has happened in the present case that is if the appellant <ORG> which had initially proposed to acquire the land for extension of sewerage treatment plant wanted subsequently to acquire the same land for its staff quarters then such a purpose must be specifically indicated in the plan meaning thereby that the land must be shown to be reserved for the staff quarters of the <ORG> and then <ORG> which had become the appropriate planning authority i <ORG> would be required to issue a fresh proposal under Section read with Section and Section of the Act and follow the gamut thereafter However as the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition on the ground of delay and laches and his view was upset by <ORG> which according to me had not taken correct view on this score as held by my learned brother <NAME> and with which view I respectfully concur I deem it fit to record my additional reasons for non suiting the respondent petitioners on that score Thus upto th April they had no objection to their land had already got de reserved for the extension of the sewage plant from being acquired and they concentrated on compensation only This also shows that Respondent Nos and were fully alive to the fact that there was no scope for extension of Dharavi Sewage Plant on their land Despite all these facts within the knowledge of the respondent nos they set on the fence and allowed the acquisition proceedings to continue and reach their terminus and even after award was passed and possession was taken by the <ORG> they staked their claims only for additional compensation It is only thereafter that they filed writ petition on th July Such a belated writ petition therefore was rightly rejected by the learned single Judge on the ground of gross delay and laches The respondent writ petitioners can be said to have waived their objections to the acquisition on the ground of extinction of public purpose by their own inaction lethargy and indolent conduct That finding is obviously incorrect for the simple reason that because of the indolent conduct of the writ petitioners land got acquired award was passed compensation was handed over to various claimants including the landlord Reference applications came to be filed for larger compensation by claimants including writ petitioners themselves Thus right to get more compensation got vested in diverse claimants by passing of the award as well as vested right was created in favour of the Bombay <ORG> by virtue of the vesting of the land in <ORG> for being handed over to the <ORG> The writ petition came to be filed after all these events had taken place I therefore respectfully agree with the conclusion to which my learned brother <NAME> has reached that on the ground of delay and laches the writ petition is required to be dismissed and the appeal has to be allowed on that ground
