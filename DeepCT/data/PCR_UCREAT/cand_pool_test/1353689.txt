recall a decision of a smaller <ORG> lnterpretation of statutes Words to be given normal meaning with reference to context Golden rule of interpretation When to be resorted to On an appeal filed by respondent No directly under Article of the Constitution against the order of discharge the <ORG> held on that a member of <ORG> was not a public servant and set aside the order of the Special judge It therefore suo motu withdrew this special case and another one filed against the appellant by another person and transferred them to the <ORG> with the request to the Chief Justice to assign these two cases to a sitting Judge of the <ORG> who should proceed to expeditiously dispose of the cases preferably by holding trial from day to day Special Leave Petitions as well as a writ petition filed by the appellant against the aforesaid decision were dismissed by this <ORG> on April holding that the Judge was perfectly justified and indeed it was his duty to follow the decision of this <ORG> which was binding on him It also observed that the writ petition challenging the validity of the order and judgment of this <ORG> as nullity or otherwise could not be entertained and that the dismissal of the writ petition would not prejudice the petitioner right to approach this <ORG> with an appropriate review petition or any other application which he may be entitled to in law Against the aforesaid order the appellant filed a Special Leave Petition before this <ORG> questioning the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to try the case in violation of the appellant fundamental rights conferred by Articles and and the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of This <ORG> granted special leave in the Special Leave Petition questioning the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to try the case and stayed further proceedings in the <ORG> An application filed by respondent No for revocation of the Special Leave was dismissed and the appeal was referred to a <ORG> of seven Judges Where by a specific clause of a specific statute the power is given for trial by the Special Judge only and transfer can be from one such Judge to another Special Judge there is no warrant to suggest that the <ORG> has power to transfer Such a case from a Judge under of the Act of to itself The fact that the objection was not raised before this <ORG> gave directions on th February cannot amount to any waiver In the instant case the presumption cannot be taken firstly because the question of jurisdiction was not agitated before the <ORG> secondly these directions were given per incuriam and thirdly the superior <ORG> alone can set aside an error in its directions when attention is drawn to that error There was no argument no submission and no decision on this appeal at all There was no prayer in the appeal which was pending before this <ORG> for such directions which includes offences by public servants mentioned in the Act to be over ridden in the manner sought to be followed as a consequential direction of this <ORG> This <ORG> is not powerless to correct its error which has the effect of depriving a citizen of his fundamental rights and more so the A right to life and liberty The <ORG> has the power to review either under Article or suo motu the directions given by this <ORG> It was a mistake of so great a magnitude that it deprives a man by being treated differently of his fundamental right for defending himself in a criminal trial in accordance with law Therefore when the attention of the <ORG> is drawn the <ORG> has always the power and the obligation to correct it ex debito justitiae and treat the second application by its inherent power as a power of review to correct the original mistake The principle of finality on which Article proceeds applies to both judgments and orders made by the <ORG> Four valuable rights of the appellant have been taken away by the impugned directions i The right to be tried by a Special Judge in accordance with the procedure established by law and enacted by <ORG> The appellant has also a right not to be singled out for special treatment by a Special <ORG> created for him alone The appellant has a further right under Article of the Constitution a right to trial by a Special Judge under of the Act which is the procedure established by law made by the <ORG> and a further right to move the <ORG> by way of revision or first appeal under of the said Act He has also a right not to suffer any order passed behind his back by a <ORG> in violation of the basic principles of natural justice Directions having been given in this case without hearing the appellant though the order was passed in the presence of the counsel for the appellant these are bad There was prejudice to the accused in being singled out as a special class of accused for a special dispensation witbout any room for any appeal as of right and without power of revision to the <ORG> The trial even of person holding public office though to be made speedily must be done in accordance with the procedure estab lished by law The provisions of read with of the Act of in the facts and circumstances of this case is the procedure established by law and any deviation even by a judicial direction will be negation of the rule of law He has a right to be dealt with in accordance with the law and not in derogation of it This <ORG> in its anxiety to facilitate the parties to have a speedy trial gave direction on th February without conscious awareness of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special <ORG>s under the Act and that being the only procedure established by law there can be no deviation from the terms of Article of the Constitution of India The maxim Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit An act of the <ORG> shall prejudice no man is founded upon justice and good sense and affords a safe and certain guide for the administration of the law Having regard to the enormity of the consequences of the error to the appellant and by reason of the fact that the directions were given suo motu there is nothing which detracts the power of the <ORG> to review its judgment ex debito justitiae in case injustice has been caused Section has clearly provided that offences specified in sub section of shall be triable by the Special Judge only and has taken away the power of the courts established under the Code of Criminal Procedure to try those offences Jurisdiction is thus the authority or power of the court to deal with a matter and make an order carrying binding force in the facts The jurisdiction to try a case could only be conferred by law enacted by the legislature and this Court could not confer jurisdiction if it does not exist in law But at the same time there should be no hesitation in correcting an error in exercise of inherent jurisdiction if it comes to the notice of the <ORG> A Per Venkatachaliah Dissenting The exclusiveness of jurisdiction uf the special judge under of Act depends on the construction to be placed on the relevant statutory provision A Before a superior court there is no distinction in the quality of the decision making process respecting jurisdictional questions on the one hand and adjudicatory issues or issues pertaining to the merits on the other A The superior court has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction and an error in that determination does not make it an error of jurisdiction Superior courts apart even the ordinary civil courts of the land have jurisdiction to decide questions of their own jurisdiction Before a person is deprived of his personal liberty not only that the procedure established by law must strictly be complied with and not departed from to the disadvantage or detriment of the person but also that the procedure for such deprivation of personal liberty must be reasonable fair and just Article imposes limitations upon the procedure and requires it to conform to such standards of reasonableness fairness and justness as the <ORG> acting as sentinel of fundamental rights would in the context consider necessary and requisite A judge of <ORG> hears appeals arising from the decisions of the Special Judge and exercises a jurisdiction which includes powers co extensive with that of the trial court which provides such an appeal as of right when the trial is held by <ORG> Directions for transfer were issued on in the open court in the presence of appellant counsel at the time of pronouncement of the judgment and counsel had the right and the opportunity of making submission to the court as to the permissibility or otherwise of the transfer After the directions were pronounced and before the order was signed though there was opportunity for the appellant counsel to make submission in regard to the alleged illegality or impropriety of the directions appellant did not utilise the same There is also reference to of the Criminal Procedure Code even a person not eo nomine a party to the proceedings or where a party has had no notice and a decree is made against him in which case the party is said to become entitled to relief ex debito justitiae on proof of the fact that there was no service since there is no trial at all and the judgment is for default This Court had therefore the jurisdiction and power to with draw and transfer the cases from Special Judge to <ORG> and the directions for trial of the offences by a Special Judge are not void and these directions could not be challenged in a collateral attack Though there is nothing in ss and read together to preclude altogether the appointment of a judge of <ORG> fulfilling the above qualifications as a special judge such is not the atleast not the normal contemplation of the Act Hence in the instant case apart from the fact that no appointment of a <ORG> Judge as a Special Judge has in fact been made it is not possible to take the view that the statutory provisions permit the conferment of a jurisdiction to try this case on a <ORG> Judge as a Special Judge Effect is only being given to the express and specific words used in and no question arises of any construction being encouraged that is repugnant to the Cr It is used in a wide and broad sense while dealing with administrative or quasi judicial tribunals and subordinate courts over which the superior courts exercise a power of judicial review and superintendence Then it is only a question of how much latitude the court is prepared to allow and there is no yardstick to determine the magnitude of the error other than the opinion of the court It was possible for another court to give a wider interpretation to these provisions and come to the conclusion that such an order could be made under those provisions There was no issue or controversy or discussion before it as to the comparative merits of a trial before a special judge vis a vis one before <ORG> Therefore this <ORG> was in error when it directed that the trial of the case should be before a High <ORG> Judge in consequence of which the appellant is being tried by a <ORG> which has no jurisdiction and which cannot be empowered by <ORG> to try him GI Section cannot be challenged under Article as it is based on a reasonable classification having relation to the objects sought to be achieved Though in general the trial of cases will be by courts having the normal jurisdiction over them the exigencies of the situation may require that they be dealt with by some other court for various reasons FJ A judicial discretion to transfer or withdraw is vested in the highest court of the State and is made exercisable only in the circumstances set out in the section Even if there is a differential treatment which causes prejudice it is based on logical and acceptable considerations with a view to promote the interests of justice <ORG> will consider any petition presented under Article in the light of the in built requirements of Article and dispose it of as if it were itself a petition of appeal from the judgment Therefore an accused tried directly by <ORG> by withdrawal of his case from a subordinate court has a right of appeal to <ORG> under of the Cr But the degree of compliance with this rule and the extent or consequences flowing from failure to do so will vary from case to case In the instant case the appellant had been given no chance of being heard before the impugned direction was given and it cannot be said whether the Bench would have acted in the same way even if he had been given such opportunity He is approaching the <ORG> nearly after two years of his trial by the learned judge in the <ORG> A Situations can and do arise where this <ORG> may be constrained to recall or modify an order which has been passed by it earlier and that when ex facie there is something radically wrong with the earlier order this <ORG> may have to exercise its plenary and inherent powers to recall the earlier order without considering itself bound by the nice technicalities of the procedure for getting this done Where a mlstake is committed by a subordinate court or a <ORG> there are ample powers in this <ORG> to remedy the situation But where the mistake is in an earlier order of this <ORG> there is no way of having it corrected except by approaching this <ORG> Suffice it to say that the court can grant relief where there is some manifest illegality or want of jurisdiction in the earlier order or some palpable in Justice is shown to have resulted However such power has to be exercised in the rarest of rare cases and there is great need for judicial discipline of the highest order in exercising such a power as any laxity in this regard may not only impair the eminence dignity and integrity of this <ORG> but may also lead to chaotic consequences The power of review is conferred on this Court by Article of the Constitution No doubt this Court has power to extend the time within which a review petition may be filed But having regard to the circumstances of the case there is hardly any reason to condone the delay in the prayer for review Granting that the power of review is available it is one to be sparingly exercised only in extraordinary or emergent situations when there can be no two opinions about the error or lack of jurisdiction in the earlier order and there are adequate reasons to invoke a resort to an unconventional method of recalling or revoking the same <NAME> cannot be treated as an authority for the proposition that an earlier order of this Court could be quashed by the issue of a writ on the ground that it violated the fundamental rights However this is not one of those cases in which it is considered appropriate to recall the earlier direction and order a re trial of the appellant de novo before a Special Judge <NAME> delivered a dissenting opinion <NAME> was a partly concurring and partly dissenting opinion <NAME> The main question involved in this appeal is whether the directions given by this Court on th February In order to answer these questions certain facts have to be borne in mind It was submitted by respondent No that there was no necessity of any sanction since the appellant had ceased to be a public servant after his resignation as Chief Minister On th of October <NAME> overruled the appellants objection to his jurisdiction to take cognizance of the complaint and to issue process in the absence of a notification under section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act hereinafter referred to as Act specifying which of the three Special Judges of the area should try such cases <ORG> on th of January notified the appointment of <NAME> as the Special Judge to try the offences specified under section of the Act On or about th of July it appears that <NAME> Special Judge discharged the appellant holding that a member of <ORG> is a public servant and there was no valid sanction for prosecuting the appellant It was submitted that the appellant right to be tried by a competent court according to the procedure established by law enacted by <ORG> and his rights of appeal and revision to <ORG> under section of the Act had been taken away This Court further gave the following directions The accused was the Chief Minister of a premier State the State of Maharashtra The Special Judge <NAME> after hearing the parties had decided the case was validly filed before him and he had properly taken cognizance During the pendency of the said revision application <ORG> issued a notification appointed Special Judge <NAME> as the Judge of the special case It is important to take note of this contention because one of the points urged by <NAME> on behalf of the appellant was that not only we should set aside the trial before <ORG> as being without jurisdiction but we should direct that no further trial should take place before the Special Judge because the appellant has suffered a lot of which we shall mention later but also because cognizance of the offences had not been taken properly Against the order of <ORG> the appellant filed a petition under Article of the constitution The order of taking cognizance had therefore become final and cannot be reagitated Moreover section of the Code expressly provides that if any Magistrate not empowered by law to take cognizance of an offence on a complaint under section of the Code erroneously in good faith does so his proceedings shall not be set aside merely on the ground that he was not so empowered There was another order passed on th of March whereby <NAME> dealt with the other contentions raised as to his jurisdiction and rejected the objections of the appellant This Court in dismissing the writ petition observed inter alia as follows In my view the writ petition challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by this <ORG> as nullity or otherwise incorrect cannot be entertained I wish to make it clear that the dismissal of this writ petition will not pre judice the right of the petitioner to approach the <ORG> with an appropriate review petition or to file any other application which he may be entitled in law to file No of questioning the jurisdiction to try the case in violation of the appellant fundamental rights conferred by Articles and and the provisions of the Act of The appellant also filed a Writ Petition No of challenging a portion of section of Code as ultra vires Articles and of the Constitution Of the order dated th The contention that has been canvassed before us was that save as provided in sub section of section of the Code the provisions thereof corresponding to section of the Criminal Procedure Code shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before the Special Judge and for purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting the prosecution before a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor The only question with which we are concerned in this appeal is whether the case which is triable under the Act only by a Special Judge appointed under section of the said Act could be transferred to <ORG> for trial by itself or by this <ORG> to <ORG> for trial by it Equally section deals with the power of <ORG> to transfer cases and appeals Under section of the Act <ORG> is authorised to appoint as many Special Judges as may be necessary for such area or areas for specified offences including offences under the Act Section of the Act deals with cases triable by Special Judges The question therefore is whether this <ORG> under section of the Code could have transferred a case which was triable only by a Special Judge to be tried by <ORG> or even if an application had been made to this <ORG> under section of the Code to transfer the case triable by a Special Judge to another Special Judge could that be transferred to a <ORG> for trial by it It was contended by <NAME> that the jurisdiction to entertain and try cases is conferred either by the Constitution or by the laws made by <ORG> He referred us to the powers of this <ORG> under Articles and of the Constitution He also referred to Entry of List I of the Constitution which deals with the constitution of the courts He further submitted that the appellant has a right to be tried in accordance with law He referred us to the previous order of this <ORG> directing the transfer of cases to <ORG> and submitted that it was a nullity because of the consequences of the wrong directions of this <ORG> There was no jurisdiction according to <NAME> or power to transfer a case from the <ORG> of the Special Judge to any High <ORG> It is apparent that the impugned directions could not have been given under section of the Code as the <ORG> has no such power to order the transfer from the <ORG> of the Special Judge to the High <ORG> of Bombay The Court emphasised that the Special Judge had exclusive jurisdiction to try offences enumerated in section a and It was submitted that a Special Judge except in so far as a specific provision to the contrary is made is governed by all the provisions of the Code and he is a Court subordinate to <ORG> It was submitted that power under section of the old Code corresponding to section of the new Code can be exercised qua a Special Judge <ORG> it was submitted consciously exercised this power Under section however corresponding to section of the old Code it was submitted <ORG> has power to transfer any case to itself for being tried by it it was submitted He moved this <ORG> under section of the old Code praying for transfer of his case to another State on various grounds Section of the Act required the offences involved in that case to be tried by a Special Judge only and section of the Act required the offences to be tried by a Special Judge for the area within which these were committed which condition could never be satisfied if there was a transfer This provision is at par with the section of the Code which confers territorial jurisdiction on Sessions Judges and magistrates It was held that there was no inconsistency between section of the Code and section of the Act as the territorial jurisdiction created by the latter operates in a different sphere and under different circumstances It is not exclusive qua a <ORG> of superior jurisdiction including a <ORG> which can hear an appeal against its decision There is no doubt that under this Article the case can be withdrawn from <ORG> It was further submitted that any case transferred for trial to <ORG> in which it exercises jurisdiction only by reason of the order of transfer is a case tried not in ordinary original criminal jurisdiction but in extraordinary original criminal jurisdiction Reference may also be made to the Law Commissioner st Report paragraphs to at page and paragraph The Act was passed to provide for speedier trial but the procedure evolved should not be so directed it was submitted that it would violate Article as was held in <NAME> case supra Section of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other law the offences specified in sub section of section shall be triable by Special Judges only So the law provides for a trial by Special Judge only and this is notwithstanding anything contained in sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure Could it therefore be accepted that this Court exercised a power not given to it by <ORG> or the Constitution and acted under a power not exercisable by it The question that has to be asked and answered is if a case is tried by a Special Judge or a court subordinate to <ORG> against whose order an appeal or a revision would lie to <ORG> is transferred by this Court to <ORG> and such right of appeal or revision is taken away would not an accused be in a worse position than others It is only made dear that if the application had been made to <ORG> under section of the Code <ORG> might have transferred the case to itself The second question that arises here is if such a wrong direction has been given by this Court can such a direction inter parties be challenged subsequently And there is no yardstick to determine the magnitude of the error other than the opinion of the <ORG> Emphasis supplied While applying the ratio to the facts of the present controversy it has to be borne in mind that section of the Act creates a condition which is sine qua non for the trial of offenders under section of that Act In this connection the offences specified under section of the Act are those punishable under sections and A of the Indian Penal Code and section of the Act This <ORG> was not called upon and did not decide the express limitation on the power conferred by section of the Code which includes offences by public servants mentioned in the Act to be overridden in the manner sought to be followed as the consequential direction of this <ORG> Judged by that view the singling out of the appellant in this case for a speedier trial by <ORG> for an offence of which <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try under the Act of was in our opinion unwarranted unprecedented and the directions given by this <ORG> for the said purpose were not warranted It appears that when this Court gave the aforesaid directions on th February for the disposal of the case against the appellant by <ORG> the directions were given oblivious of the relevant provisions of law and the decision in <NAME> case supra The Court was examining in that case only the doctrine of precedents and determining the extent to which it could take a different view from one previously taken in a different case between different parties According to <NAME> the doctrine of per incuriam has no application in the same proceedings We are of the opinion that this Court is not powerless to correct its error which has the effect of depriving a citizen of his fundamental rights and more so the right to life and liberty Powers of review can be exercised in a petition filed under Article or Article or under any other provision of the Constitution if the Court is satisfied that its directions have resulted in the deprivation of the fundamental rights of a citizen or any legal right of the petitioner The petitioner contended that the rule was invalid as it placed obstructions on the fundamental right guaranteed under Article to move <ORG> for the enforcement of fundamental rights This rule as well as the judicial order dismissing the petition under Article of the Constitution for non compliance with Rule of order XXXV of <ORG> Rules were held invalid In order to appreciate the significance of this point and the actual ratio of that decision so far as it is relevant for our present purpose it is necessary to refer to a few facts of that decision The petioners then tried to collect the requisite fund but failed in their efforts and that led to the said petition filed on March by the said petitioners The petitioners contended that the impugned rule in so far as it related to the giving of security was ultra vires because it contravened the fundamental right guaranteed to the petitioners under Article of the Constitution There were two orders namely one for security of costs and another for the dismissal of the previous application under Article of the Constitution The right to move the Supreme <ORG> it was emphasised under Article was an absolute right and the content of this right could not be circumscribed or impaired on any ground and an order for furnishing security for the respondent costs retarded the assertion or vindication of the fundamental right under Article and contravened the said right Though Article empowers the Supreme <ORG> to pass any order to do complete justice between the parties the <ORG> cannot make an order inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution Nor did Article confer power upon this <ORG> to make rules empowering it to contravene the provisions of the fundamental right It was emphasised that an order which this <ORG> could make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution but it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statutory laws Emphasis A supplied The <ORG> therefore held that it was not possible to hold that Article conferred upon this <ORG> powers which could contravene the provisions of Article If that was so as in <NAME> case that was a mistake of so great a magnitude that it deprives a man by being treated differently of his fundamental right for defending himself in a criminal trial in accordance with law If that was so then when the attention of the <ORG> is drawn the <ORG> has always the power and the obligation to correct it ex debito justitiae and treat the second application by its inherent power as a power of review to correct the original mistake The facts were different and not quite relevant for our present purposes but in order to appreciate the contentions urged it will be appropriate to refer to certain portions of the same There was a suit for defamation against the editor of a weekly newspaper which was filed in the original side of the High <ORG> It was contended that the High <ORG> did not have inherent power to pass the order the impugned order violated the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Article a and the order was amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this <ORG> under Article of the constitution It was held by <NAME> <NAME> for himself and five other learned Judges that the order was within the inherent power of the High <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> was however of the view that the Code of Civil Procedure contained no express provision authorising the <ORG> to hold its proceedings in camera but if excessive publicity itself operates as an instrument of injustice the <ORG> has inherent jurisdiction to pass an order excluding the public when the nature of the case necessitates such a course to be adopted <NAME> <NAME> further reiterated that if a judicial tribunal makes an order which it has jurisdiction to make by applying a law which is valid in all respects that order cannot offend a fundamental right An order which is within the jurisdiction of the tribunal which made it if the tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the matters that were litigated before it and if the law which it applied in making the order was a valid law could not be interfered with It was reiterated that the tribunal having this jurisdiction does not act without jurisdiction if it makes an error in the application of the law <NAME> Observed at page of the report that in <NAME> case the rule required the furnishing of security in petition under Article and it was held to abridge the fundamental rights When judged under the Constitution it is still a void order although it may bind parties unless set aside We are therefore of the opinion that the appropriate order would be to recall the directions contained in the order dated th February This position was not accepted by the <ORG> officer who passed certain orders It was held by this Court by a majority of five learned Judges that the answer to the questions must be in the negative <NAME> speaking for himself observed that the right to move this Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution was itself a guaranteed fundamental right and this Court was not trammelled by procedural technicalities in making an order or issuing a writ for the enforcement of such rights The question however was whether a quasi judicial authority which made an order in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction in pursuance of a provision of law which was intra vires an error of law or fact committed by that authority could not be impeached otherwise than on appeal unless the erroneous determination related to a matter on which the jurisdiction of that body depended In such a case the characteristic attribute of a judicial act or decision was that it binds whether right or wrong and no question of the enforcement of a fundamental right could arise on an application under Article It was manifest to the Bench that exclusive jurisdiction created under section of the Act read with section of the said Act when brought to the notice of this <ORG> precluded the exercise of the power under section of the Code There was no argument no submission and no decision on this aspect at all There was no prayer in the appeal which was pending before this <ORG> for such directions Four valuable rights it appears to us of the appellant have been taken away by the impugned directions i The right to be tried by a Special Judge in accordance with the procedure established by law and enacted by <ORG> In this connection <NAME> rightly submitted that it is no necessary to consider whether section of the Criminal Procedure Code confers the right of appeal to this Court from the judgment of a learned Judge of <ORG> to whom the case had been assigned inasmuch as the transfer itself was illegal One has to consider that section of the Criminal Procedure Code was subject to the overriding mandate of section of the Act and hence it does not permit <ORG> to withdraw a case for trial to itself from <ORG> In the instant case that presumption cannot be taken firstly because the question of jurisdiction was not agitated before the <ORG> secondly these directions were given per incuriem as mentioned hereinbefore and thirdly the superior <ORG> alone can set aside an error in its directions when attention is drawn to that error It has to be borne in mind that as in <NAME> <ORG> office here form becomes substance No doubt that being so it must be by decisions and authorities it appears to us patently clear that the directions given by this <ORG> on th February were clearly unwarranted by constitutional provisions and in derogation of the law enacted by the <ORG> See the observations of Attorney General <NAME> where it was reiterated that the creation of a right to an appeal is an act which requires legislative authority neither an inferior <ORG> nor the superior <ORG> or both combined can create such a right it being one of limitation and extension of jurisdiction See also the observations of <NAME> <NAME> A where it was reiterated by <ORG> that if an order is regular it can be set aside by an appellate <ORG> if the order is irregular it can be set aside by the <ORG> that made it on the application being made to that <ORG> either under the rules of that <ORG> dealing expressly with setting aside orders for irregularity or ex debito justitiae if the circumstances warranted namely violation of the rules of natural justice or fundamental rights In <NAME> <NAME> I A it was held that under the old Civil Procedure Code under section the superior <ORG> could not make an order of transfer of a case unless the <ORG> from which the transfer was souht to be made had jurisdiction to try In the facts of the instant case the criminal revision application which was pending before the High <ORG> even if it was deemed to be transferred to this <ORG> under Article A of the Constitution it would not have vested this <ORG> with power larger than what is contained in section of Criminal Procedure Code The fact that the objection was not raised before this <ORG> giving directions on th February cannot amount to any waiver The appellant has also a right not to be singled out for special treatment by <ORG> created for him alone Here the appellant has a further right under Article of the Constitution a right to trial by a Special Judge under section of the Act which is the procedure established by law made by the <ORG> and a further right to move <ORG> by way of revision or first appeal under section of the said Act He has also a right not to suffer any order passed behind his back by a <ORG> in violation of the basic principles of natural justice Directions having been given in this case as we have seen without hearing the appellant though it appears from the circumstances that the order was passed in the presence of the counsel for the appellant these were bad In so far as <NAME> case supra which is a decision of a Bench of Judges and to the extent it affirms <NAME> case supra the Court has power to review either under section or suo motu the directions given by this Court <NAME> further submitted that we should not only ignore the directions or set aside the directions contained in the order dated th February but also direct that the appellant should not suffer any further trial We are further invited to go into the allegations and to held that there was nothing which could induce us to prolong the agony of the appellant It was further submitted that the expression Extraordinary original criminal jurisdiction under section has to be understood having regard to the language used in the Code and other relevant statutory provisions and not with reference to decisions wherein Courts described jurisdiction acquired by transfer as extraordinary original jurisdiction It appears to us that there is good deal of force in the argument that section A of the old Code which corresponds to section of the new Code contained the expression original jurisdiction He drew our attention to the principles of interpretation of statutes and drew our attention to the purpose of section of the Act He submitted that section iv is very much in the statute and and it is not repealed in respect of the cases pending before the Special Judge There is no question of repealing section iv Section deals with the power of <ORG> to transfer cases and appeals It was an Act which provided for a more speedy trial of certain offences For this it gave power to appoint Special Judges and stipulated for appointment of Special Judges under the Act He referred us to Dias on jurisprudence th Edition page and relied on the decision of <NAME> <ORG> All at In this case in view of the specific language used in section it is not necessary to consider the other submissions of <NAME> whether the procedure for trial by Special Judges under the Code has stood repealed or not It is clear that words should normally be given their ordinary meaning bearing in mind the context He observed The only rule for the construction of Acts of <ORG> is that they should be construed according to the intent of the <ORG> which passed the Act The words themselves alone do in such case best declare the intention of the lawgiver Here there is no question as to what was the previous law and what was intended to be placed or replaced as observed by Lord <NAME> in House of Lords Debate Col Section of the Code undoubtedly gives a right of appeal Where by a specific clause of a specific statute the power is given for trial by the Special Judge only and transfer can be from one such Judge to another Special Judge there is no warrant to suggest that the <ORG> has power to transfer such a case from a Judge under section of the Act of to itself Dealing with the submission that the order of <ORG> was void or non est and it violated the principles of natural justice it was submitted by Shri <NAME> that it was factually incorrect There is no abuse of the process of the <ORG> Shri <NAME> submitted that there was no prejudice to the accused There was prejudice to the accused in being singled out as a special class of accused for a special dispensation without room for any appeal as of right and without power of the revision to <ORG> Reliance was placed on the observations of the seven Judges Bench in Re Special Courts Bill supra He further submitted that it is imperative that persons holding high public or political office must be speedily tried in the interests of justice All this is true but the trial even of person holding public office though to be made speedily must be done in accordance with the procedure established by law The provisions of section read with section of the Act of in the facts and circumstances of this case is the procedure established by law any deviation even by a judicial direction will be negation of the rule of law The principle of finality on which the Article proceeds applies to both judgments and orders made by <ORG> <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> A held that orders made by a <ORG> of unlimited jurisdiction in the course of contentious litigation are either regular or irregular If an order is regular it can only be set aside by an appellate <ORG> if it is irregular it can be set aside by the <ORG> that made it on application being made to that <ORG> either under rules of <ORG> dealing expressly with setting aside orders for irregularity or ex debite justitiae if the circumstances warranted namely where there was a breach of the rules of natural justice etc <NAME> urged before us that Lord <NAME> had in express terms rejected the argument that any orders of a superior <ORG> of unlimited jurisdiction can over be void in the sense that they can be ignored with impunity Lord <NAME> delivered the judgment <NAME> submitted that there was no question of reviewing an order passed on the construction of law The directions given by the order of th February at page were certainly without hearing though in the presence of the parties His trial in accordance with law and the procedure established by law would have to be in accordance with the Act He has a right to be dealt with in accordance with the law and not in derogation of it This <ORG> in its anxiety to facilitate the parties to have a speedy trial gave directions on th February as mentioned hereinbefore without conscious awareness of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special <ORG> under the Act and that being the only procedure established by law there can be no deviation from the terms of Article of the Constitution of India It has been said long time ago that Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit an act of the <ORG> shall prejudice no man In that case the appellant a government servant was tried and convicted to suffer imprisonment for two years for offences under Section read with Section I We have considered the submission Yet we must remind ourselves that purity of public life is one of the cardinal principal which must be upheld as a matter of public policy ln the aforesaid view of the matter and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that the legal wrong that has been caused to the appellant should be remedied Let right be done and in doing so let no more further injury be caused to public purpose <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment proposed by my learned Brother <NAME> <NAME> While I agree with the conclusion proposed by my esteemed Brother keeping the importance of the matter particularly the consequences the decision may generate as also the fact that I was a party to the two <NAME>udge Bench decision of this <ORG> reported in SCC in view I propose to express my opinion separately <NAME> Respondent No I herein lodged a complaint in <ORG> th Esplanade Bombay on September ll against <NAME> alleging commission of several offences under the lndian Penal Code as also Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act Act for short The Governor of Bombay later accorded sanction and the Respondent no filed a fresh complaint this time in <ORG> alleging the commission of those offences which had formed the subject matter of the complaint before the Magistrate On receiving summons from the Court of the particular Special Judge <NAME> took the stand that the said Special Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint in view of the provisions of Section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act hereinafter referred to as the Act to take cognizance and such cognizance could not be taken on a private complaint The Criminal Revision Petition of the accused against the order of the Special Judge was rejected by <ORG> and it held that a private complaint was maintainable and in view of the notification specifying a particular Special Judge for the offences in question there was no basis for the objections Both the criminal appeals and the transferred criminal revision were heard together by a five Judge Bench of this Court but the two appeals were disposed of by two separate judgments delivered on February This <ORG> at page of the Reports came to hold To sum up the learned Special Judge was clearly in error in holding that A is a public servant within the meaning of the expression in Section a and further erred in holding that a sanction of <ORG> or majority of the members was a condition precedent to taking cognizance of offences committed by the accused This Court gave a further direction to the following effect The accused was the Chief Minister of a premier State the State of Maharashtra The appellant challenged <NAME> jurisdiction on th March when the matter was first placed before him but by two separate orders dated th March and th March the learned Judge rejected the objection by saying that he was bound by this <ORG> direction of the th February There is no merit in this writ petition In my view the writ petition challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by this <ORG> as nullity or otherwise incorrect cannot be entertained I wish to make it clear that the dismissal of this writ petition will not prejudice the right of the petitioner to approach the <ORG> with an appropriate review petition or to file any other application which he may be entitled in law to file Desai I broadly agree with the conclusion recorded by my brother more witnesses were examined before him and at the stage when witnesses in all had been examined for the prosecution the Trial Judge invited the parties to consider the framing of charges draft charges were placed for his consideration on behalf of the prosecution and the learned Trial Judge framed charges and recorded an order of discharge in respect of the remaining This <ORG> requested the learned Chief Justice of <ORG> to nominate another Judge to take up the matter from the stage at which <NAME> had made the order of discharge The appellant challenged the order of <NAME> by filing a special leave petition before this <ORG> wherein he further alleged that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try the case While rejecting the said revocation application by order dated October the two Judge Bench formulated several questions that arose for consideration and referred the matter for hearing by a Bench of seven Judges of the <ORG> For instance Article confers all the powers of a court of record on <ORG> including the power to punish for contempt of itself Jurisdiction is thus the authority or power of the court to deal with a matter and make an order carrying binding force in the facts At page referring to the decision in <NAME> <ORG> it has been stated Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine and in order that it may exist the following are essential A court created by law organized and sitting authority given it by law to hear and determine causes of the kind in question power given it by law to render a judgment such as it assumes to render authority over the parties to the case if the judgment is to bind them personally as a judgment in personam which is acquired over the plaintiff by his appearance and submission of the matter to the court and is acquired over the defendant by his voluntary appearance or by service of process on him authority over the thing adjudicated upon its being located within the court territory and by actually seizing it if liable to be carried away authority to decide the question involved which is acquired by the question being submitted to it by the parties for decision Section of the Code empowers this <ORG> to transfer cases and appeals by providing Whenever it is made to appear to <ORG> that an order under this section is expedient for the ends of justice it may direct that any particular case of appeal be transferred from one <ORG> to another <ORG> or from a <ORG> subordinate to one <ORG> to another <ORG> of equal or superior jurisdiction subordinate to another <ORG> Power to appoint special Judges The State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette appoint as many special Judges as may be necessary for such area or areas as may be specified in the notification to try the following offences namely a an offence punishable under section section section section section or section A of the Indian Penal Code or section of the Prevention of Corruption Act any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the offences specified in clause a Class triable by Special Judges Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other law the offences specified in sub section of section shall be triable by Special Judges only Every offence specified in sub section of section shall be tried by the Special Judge for the area within which it was committed When trying any case a Special Judge may also try any offence other than an offence specified in section A with which the accused may under the Code of Criminal Procedure be charged at the same trial Procedure and powers of Special Judges A Special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates A special Judge may with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commission thereof and any pardon so tendered shall for the purposes of sections and A of the Code of Criminal Procedure be deemed to have been tendered under section of that Code Save as provided in sub section or sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor A In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sub section the provisions of sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as may be A special Judge may pass upon any person convicted by him any sentence authorized by law for punish ment of the offence of which such person is convicted Appeal and revision <ORG> may exercise so far as they may be applicable all the powers conferred by Chapters XXXI and XXXII of the Code of Criminal Procedure I of on <ORG> as if <ORG> were <ORG> trying cases without a jury within the local limits of the jurisdiction of <ORG> Transfer of certain pending cases All cases triable by a special Judge under section which immediately before the commencement of this Act were pending before any Magistrate shall on such commencement be forwarded for trial to the special Judge having jurisdiction over such cases Section has clearly provided that offences specified in sub section of section shall be triable by the Special Judge only and has taken away the power of the courts established under the Code of Criminal Procedure to try those offences There is no doubt that after the Division Bench of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> Long arguments were advanced on either side in support of their respective stands the appellant pleading that the direction for transfer of the proceedings from the Special Judge to <ORG> was a nullity and Mr <NAME> contending that <ORG> had exercised its powers for expediting the trial and the action was not contrary to law I must however indicate here that the argument based upon the extended meaning given to the contents of Article of the Constitution though attractive have not appealed to me Brother <NAME> has referred to several authorities in support of his conclusion that an order made without jurisdiction is not a valid one and can be ignored overlooked or brushed aside depending upon the situation Brother <NAME> has also reffered to several other authorities which support this view The facts of the case as appearing from the judgment show that there was a judicial order directing furnishing of security of Rs towards the respondent costs an the majority judgment directed In the result the petition is allowed and the order passed against the petitioners on December calling upon them to furnish security of Rs is set aside By his petition filed under Article he contended that the rule was invalid as it placed obstructions on the fundamental right guaranteed under Article to move <ORG> for the enforcement of fundamental rights This plea was upheld by the majority decision with the result that the order requiring him to furnish security was vacated In appreciating the effect of this decision it is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the contentions raised before the <ORG> in that case while dealing with applications made under Article to impose such terms as to costs as to the giving of security as it thinks fit The learned Solicitor General who supported the validity of the rule urged that though the order requiring security to be deposited may be said to retard or obstruct the fundamental right of the citizen guaranteed by Article the rule itself could not be effectively challenged as invalid because it was merely discretionary it did not impose an obligation on the court to demand any security and he supplemented his argument by contending that under Article of the Constitution the powers of this court were wide enough to impose any term or condition subject to which proceedings before this <ORG> could be permitted to be conducted He suggested that the powers of this <ORG> under Article were not subject to any of the provisions contained in Part III including Article It would thus be seen that the main controversy in the case of <NAME> centered round the question as to whether Article conferred powers on this <ORG> to make rules though they may be inconsistent with the constitutional provisions prescribed by Part III Once it was held that the powers under Article had to be read subject not only to the fundamental rights but to other binding statutory provisions it became clear that the rule which authorised the making of the impugned order was invalid <NAME> speaking for a four Judge Bench in <NAME> <NAME> SCR at page stated The Judge had jurisdiction to correct his own error without entering into a discussion of the grounds taken by the decree holder or the objections raised by the judgment debtors Where a court employed a procedure in doing something which it never intended to do and there is an abuse of the process of the court it can be corrected that Where substantial injustice would othenwise result the court has in their Lordships opinion an inherent power to set aside its own judgments of condemnation so as to let in bona fide claims by parties Mr <NAME> had told us during arguments that if there was interference in this case there was possibility of litigants thinking that the <ORG> had made a direction by going out of its way because an influential person like <NAME> was involved There is still another aspect which should be taken note of I agree with the ultimate conclusion proposed by my earned brother <NAME> It appears that the learned brother had tried to emphasise that even if an error is apparent in a judgment or an order passed by this <ORG> it will not be open to a writ of certiorari and I have no hesitation in agreeing with this view expressed At the same time I have no hesitation in observing that there should be no hesitation in correcting an error in exercise of inherent jurisdiction if it comes to our notice It is clear from the opinions of learned brothers Justice <NAME> and Justice <NAME> that the jurisdiction to try a case could only be conferred by law enacted by the legislature and this <ORG> could not confer jurisdiction if it does not exist in law and it is this error which is sought to be corrected <NAME> <NAME> I have the privilege of going through the judgment prepared by learned brother <NAME> <NAME> and I agreed with the same I agree with the opinion expressed by Justice <NAME> in the judgment as well as the additional opinion given by Justice <NAME> in his separate judgment The questions raised in this appeal are extra ordinary in many respects touching as they do certain matters fundamental to the finality of judicial proceedings It also raises a question of far reaching consequences whether independently of the review jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution a different bench of this <ORG> could undo the finality of earlier pronouncements of different benches which have otherwise reached finality If the appeal is accepted it will have effect of blowing off by a side wind as it were a number of earlier decisions of different benches of this <ORG> binding inter parties rendered at various stages of the said criminal prosecution including three judgments of judge benches of this <ORG> What imparts an added and grim poignance to the case is that the appeal if allowed would set to naught all the proceedings taken over the years before three successive Judges of the High <ORG> of Bombay and in which already witnesses have been examined for the prosecution all these done pursuant to the direction dated issued by a five judge Bench of this <ORG> The question is whether there is any such gross miscarriage of justice in this case if so whether relief can be granted in the manner now sought The words of caution of the judicial committee in Venkata Narasimha Appa Row <ORG> ILR at page are worth recalling There is a salutary maxim which ought to be observed by all courts of last resort interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium <NAME> if I may say so with respect has rightly recognised these imperatives It is time to sound a note of caution Respondent No also sought and was granted special leave to appeal against Judge <NAME> order directly to this court in Criminal appeal No of Appellant in these proceedings does not assail the correctness of the view taken by <ORG> on the question of the sanction It is however relevant to mention that when the matter was before <NAME> who was the first learned Judge to be designated by the Chief Justice on <ORG> the appellant challenged his jurisdiction on grounds which amounted to a challenge to the validity of directions of this <ORG> for the transfer of the case I have no hesitation in contemplating at three situations in which a <ORG> jurisdiction could try such offence Admittedly there are no special provisions in the Act or Act relating to the transfer of special cases from one Court to the other of the Act and Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure <ORG> will have jurisdiction under Sec of the Code in relation to the special cases also Appellant did not seek any review of the directions at the hands of the Bench which had issued them but moved in this Court a Writ Petition No of under Article of the Constitution assailing taken by <NAME> as to jurisdiction which in substance meant a challenge to the original order dated made by this court Sen <NAME> speaking for the bench said In my view the writ petition challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by this <ORG> as nullity or otherwise is incorrect cannot be entertained I wish to make it clear that the dismissal of this writ petition will not prejudice the right of the petitioner to approach the <ORG> with an appropriate review petition or to file any other application which he may be entitled in law to file The view taken by my two learned Brothers it is needless to emphasise has the effect of setting at naught this pronouncement of the five Judge Bench as well The five Judge bench considered the legal foundations of the power to transfer and said To be precise the learned Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for cases instituted otherwise than on police report by Magistrate emphasis supplied According to the Bench <ORG> power under Section Criminal Procedure Code for withdrawing to itself the case from a Special Judge who was for this purpose a Sessions Judge was preserved notwithstanding the exclusivity of the jurisdiction of the Special Judge and that <ORG> was entitled to and did exercise that power as the Criminal Review application pending in <ORG> had been withdrawn to <ORG> In the meanwhile <NAME> was nominated by the Chief Justice of <ORG> in place of <NAME> In addition to the witnesses already examined by <NAME> more witnesses were examined for the prosecution before <NAME> of the charges which the prosecution required to be framed in the case <NAME> declined to frame charges in respect of and discharged the appellant of those alleged offences Again respondent No came up to this Court which by its order dated in Criminal Appeal No of reported in SCC set aside the order of discharge in regard to offences and directed that charges be drawn in respect of them There is no doubt that if there were a super Supreme <ORG> a substantial proportion of our reversals of state <ORG>s would also be reversed In Broom Cassel AC at Lord Diplock said It is inevitable in a hierarchical system of courts that there are decisions of the supreme appellate tribunal which do not attract the unanimous approval of all members of the judiciary No self respecting Judge would wish to act if he did so at the risk of being called a usurper whenever he failed to anticipate and predict what another Judge thought of his conclusions Appellant contends that the earlier bench had no jurisdiction to issue the impugned directions which were without any visible legal support that they are void as violative of the constitutional rights of the appellant and also as violating the Rules of natural justice Before a superior court there is no distinction in the quality of the decision making process respecting jurisdictional questions on the one hand and adjudicatory issues or issues pertaining to the merits on the other In <NAME> <NAME> I A the executing <ORG> had quite wrongly held that a particular person represented the estate of the deceased Judgment debtor and put the property for sale in execution The judicial committee said In doing so the <ORG> was exercising its jurisdiction It made a sad mistake it is true but a court has jurisdiction to decide wrong as well as right In the course of the arguments there were references to the Anisminic case The superior court has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction and an error in that determination does not make it an error of jurisdiction It follows that a superior court has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction and that therefore an erroneous conclusion as to the ambit of its jurisdiction is merely an abuse of its jurisdiction and not an act outside its jurisdiction See A clear reference to inappositeness and limitations of the Anisminic Rule in relation to <ORG> so to be found in the opinion of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> All thus There is in my view however also an obvious distinction between jurisdiction conferred by a statute on a court of law of limited jurisdiction to decide a defined question finally and conclusively or unappealably and a similar jurisdiction conferred on <ORG> or a judge of <ORG> acting in his judicial capacity There is thus no room for the inference that <ORG> did not intend <ORG> or the judge of <ORG> acting in his judicial capacity to be entitled and indeed required to construe the words of the statute by which the question submitted to his decision was defined There is simply no room for error going to his jurisdiction or as is conceded by counsel for the respondent is there any room for judicial review The cases that are referred to in these dicta do not support the proposition that there is any category of orders of a court of unlimited jurisdiction of this kind They are inapplicable to orders made by a court of unlimited jurisdiction in the course of contentious litigation if it is irregular it can be sel aside by the court that made it on application to High court if it is regular it can only be set aside by an appellate court on appeal if there is one to which an appeal lies See page Superior courts apart even the ordinary civil courts of the land have jurisdiction to decide questions of their own jurisdiction This Court in the context of the question whether the provisions of Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act was not attracted to the premises in question and whether consequently the exclusion under Section of that Act of the jurisdiction of all courts other than <ORG> in Greater Bombay did not operate observed The crucial point therefore in order to determine the question of the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain the suit is to ascertain whether in view of Section of the Act the Act applies to the premises at all If it does <ORG> has no jurisdiction but if it does not then it has such jurisdiction It is well settled that <ORG> has inherent power to decide the question of its own jurisdiction although as a result of its enquiry it may turn out that it has no jurisdiction over the suit No body doubts that there was a right to go from court to court as my Lord has already explained There are no different courts now to go to SCR it was held It is in the interest of the public at large that a finality should attach to the binding decisions pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction and it is also in the public interest that individuals should not be vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation If these two principles form the foundation of the general rule of res judicata they cannot be treated as irrelevant or inadmissible even in dealing with fundamental rights in petitions filed under Article The right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed by Article The exclusiveness of jurisdiction of the special judge under Section of Act in turn depends on the construction to be placed on the relevant statutory provision The reported decisions on the review power under the Civil Procedure Code when it had a similar provision for the same judges hearing the matter demonstrate the high purpose sought to be served thereby Not one case in a hundred has any merits in it Second In such a case the party is said to become entitled to relief ex debito justitiae on proof of the fact that there was no service This is a class of cases where there is no trial at all and the judgment is for default But there are judgments obtained by default which do not represent a judicial determination Yet there is a type of collateral action known as an action of review by which even a superior court judgment can be questioned even between the parties and set aside Cases of such frank failure of natural justice are obvious cases where relief is granted as of right a category of orders of such a court which a person affected by the order is entitled to apply to have set aside ex debito justitiae in exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court without needing to have recourse to the Rules that deal expressly with proceedings to setaside orders for irregularity and give to the judge a discretion as to the order he will make Referring to the law on the matter Lord <NAME> said It is unquestionably the strict rule and ought to be distinctly understood as such that no cause in this <ORG> can be re heard and that an order once made that is a report submitted to His Majesty and adopted by being made an order in <ORG> is final and cannot be altered which vitiates the most solemn proceedings of courts of justice In Sutherland Statutory construction the following passages occur Prior statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be compared with the new provisions and if possible by reasonable construction both are to be so construed that effect is given to every provision of each Emphasis supplied When the legislature enacts a provision it has before it a the other provisions relating to the same subject matter which it enacts at that time whether in the same statute or in a separate Act It is evident that it has in mind the provisions of a prior Act to which it refers whether it phrases the later Act as amendment or an independent Act Before a person is deprived of his personal liberty not only that the Procedure established by law must strictly be complied with and not departed from to the disadvantage or detriment of the person but also that the procedure for such deprivation of personal liberty must be reasonable fair and just Article imposes limitations upon the procedure and requires it to conform to such standards of reasonableness fairness and justness as the <ORG> acting as sentinel of fundamental rights would in the context consider necessary and requisite A judge of <ORG> hears appeals arising from the decisions of the Special Judge and exercises a jurisdiction which includes powers co extensive with that of the trial court There is thus no substance in contention These directions it is not disputed were issued on in the open <ORG> in the presence of appellant learned counsel at the time of pronouncement of the judgment It cannot be said that after the directions were pronounced and before the order was signed there was no opportunity for the appellant learned counsel to make any submissions in regard to the alleged illegality or impropriety of the directions There is however a wider sense in which the doctrine of res judicata may be applicable whereby it becomes an abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore should have been litigated in earlier proceedings which provides such an appeal as of right when the trial is held by <ORG> There is no substance in contention either Contention The argument is that the earlier order of the five Judge bench in so far as it violates the fundamental rights of the appellant under Article and must be held to be void and amenable to challenge under Article in this very <ORG> and that the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra supports such a position Learned Chief Justice referring to the scope of the matter that fell for consideration in <NAME> case stated It would thus be seen that the main controversy in the case of <NAME> centered round the question as to whether Article conferred powers on this Court to make rules though they may be inconsistent with the constitutional provisions prescribed by part III Once it as held that the powers under Article had to be read subject not only to the fundamental rights but to other binding statutory provisions it became clear that the ruler which authorised the making of the impugned order was invalid Only where the issuing court could be said to have lacked jurisdiction in the sense of authority to adjudicate the cause and to reach the parties through its mandate were disobedient contemnors permitted to raise the invalidity of the order as a full defence There is no substance in contention either There is also reference to Section of the Criminal Procedure Code There is no substance in contention I have had the benefit of perusing the drafts of the judgments proposed by my learned brothers <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> JJ On the question whether the direction given by this Court in its judgment dated should be recalled I find myself in agreement with the conclusion of <NAME> though for slightly different reasons in preference to the conclusion reached by <NAME> and <NAME> I would therefore like to set out my views separately on this issue The proceedings have had a chequered career as narrated in the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> Various issues have come up for consideration of this <ORG> at the earlier stages of the proceedings and the judgments of this <ORG> have been reported In SCR SCR SCR SCR and At present the appellant is being tried by a learned Judge of <ORG> nominated by the Chief Justice of <ORG> in pursuance of the direction given by this <ORG> in its order dated reported in SCR But the principal contention urged on behalf of the appellant before us centres not round the merits of the order under appeal on the above two issues but round what the counsel for the appellant has described as a fundamental and far reaching objection to the very validity of his trial before the learned Judge However as the correctness of the direction issued is impugned by the petitioner as there is no detailed discussion in the earlier order on the points raised by the petitioner and as <NAME> has expressed an opinion on these contentions with parts of which I am unable to agree it will be perhaps more convenient to have a look at the first issue as if it were coming up for consideration for the first time before us and then depending upon the answer to it consider the second issue as to whether this <ORG> has any jurisdiction to recall or revoke the earlier order It is common ground that the jurisdiction to try offences of the type with which are concerned here is vested by the Act in Special Judges appointed by the respective State Governments Section reads thus Whenever it is made to appear to <ORG> a that a fair and impartial inquiry or trial cannot be had in any Criminal Court subordinate thereto or that some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise or that an order under this section is required by any provision of this Code or will tend to the general convenience of the parties or witnesses or is expedient for the ends of justice it may order i that any offence be inquired into or tried by any Court not qualified under Section to both inclusive but in other respects competent to inquire into or try such offences ii that any particular case or appeal or class of cases or appeals be transferred from <ORG> subordinate to its authority to any other such <ORG> of equal or superior jurisdiction iii that any particular case be committed for trial to <ORG> or iv that any particular case or appeal be transferred to and tried before itself And cl of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court runs thus And we do further ordain that the said <ORG> shall have power to direct the transfer of any criminal case or appeal from any <ORG> to any other <ORG> of appeal or superior jurisdiction and also to direct the preliminary investigation of trial of any criminal case by any officer of <ORG> otherwise competent to investigate or try it though such case belongs in ordinary course to the jurisdiction of some other officer of <ORG> Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the language of section of the Act is mandatory it directs that offences specified in the Act can be tried only by persons appointed under of the Act by <ORG> to be special judges No other Judge it is said has jurisdiction to try such a case even if he is a Judge of <ORG> All <ORG> Judges may not have been Sessions Judges earlier and it is common ground <NAME> <NAME> who has been nominated by the Chief Justice for trying this case does not fulfill the qualifications prescribed for appointment as a Special Judge On the other hand it is contended for the respondent that the only purpose of the Act is to ensure that cases of corruption and bribery do not get bogged up in the ordinary criminal courts which are over burdened with all sorts of cases Though there is nothing in ss and read together to preclude altogether the appointment of a judge of <ORG> fulfilling the above qualifications as a special judge it would appear that such is not the atleast not the normal contemplation of the Act Hence apart from the fact that in this case no appointment of <ORG> Judge as a Special Judge has in fact been made it is not possible to take the view that the statutory provisions permit the conferment of a jurisdiction to try this case on <ORG> Judge as a Special Judge in the context of an objection taken by the respondent <ORG> that <ORG> did not have the jurisdiction to transfer a case pending before the Special Judge Bharatpur The first is that offences specified in section can be tried by Special Judges only The second is that every such offence shall be tried by the Special Judge for the area within which it is committed and if there are more special judges in that area by the Special Judge chosen by the <ORG> These two conditions being statutory it is submitted that no order can be made under section because on transfer even if a special judge is entrusted with the case the second condition is bound to be broken The question therefore resolves itself to this Is there an inconsistency between of the Code and the second sub section of The answer is that there is none The order of transfer when it is made under the powers given by the Code invests another officer with jurisdiction although ordinarily he would lack territorial jurisdiction to try the case However were the matter to be considered as res integra I would be inclined to accept the contention urged on behalf of the appellant for the following reasons In the first place the argument of the counsel for the respondent runs counter to the observations made by <ORG> in the earlier part of the extract set out above that the first sub section of section and the second sub section are totally different in character It is true that those observations are not binding on this larger Bench and moreover <ORG> there was dealing only with an objection based on sub section of Section I am in respectful agreement with the view taken in that case that there is a vital qualitative difference between the two sub sections and that while a case can be transferred to a special judge who may not have the ordinary territorial jurisdiction over it a transfer cannot be made to an ordinary magistrate or a court of session even if it has territorial jurisdiction Even when a case is transferred from one criminal court to another the restriction as to territorial jurisdiction may be infringed For the same reason it is not possible to hold that the power of transfer contained in clause of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court can be exercised in a manner not contemplated by section of the Act He loses the right of having two courts a subordinate court and <ORG> adjudicate upon his contentions before bringing the matter up in <ORG> There is however nothing implausible in saying that the Act having already earmarked these cases for trial by experienced <ORG> Judges made this provision immune against the applicability of the provisions of other laws in general and the <ORG> Effect is only being given to these express and specific words used in section and no question arises of any construction being encouraged that is repugnant to the <ORG> On behalf of the respondent it was contended that as the power of <ORG> under can be exercised on application of a party or even suo motu and can be exercised by it at any stage irrespective of whether any application or matter in connection with the case is pending before it or not <ORG> as an appellate Court has a co equal jurisdiction to exercise the power of transfer in the same manner as <ORG> could The argument also is that what <ORG> as an appellate or revisional court could have done was either a to direct <ORG> to consider whether this was a fit case for it to exercise its power under section iv to withdraw the case to itself and try the same with a view to expeditiously dispose it of or to have withdrawn the case to itself for trial But it is contended no power which <ORG> could exercise as an appellate or revisional court could have enabled <ORG> to transfer the case from the Special Judge to <ORG> The reliance placed in this context on the provisions contained in articles and of the Constitution and read with of the Article is only a provisions enabling <ORG> to confer supplementary powers on <ORG> to enable it to deal more effectively to exercise the jurisdication conferred on it by or under the Constitution There was no issue or controversy or discussion before it as to the comparative merits of a trial before a special judge vis a vis one before <ORG> it is therefore difficult to say in the circumstances of the case that <ORG> can issue the impugned direction in exercise of the powers under Article or under available to it as an appellate court Section provides that in the revision pending before it the High <ORG> can exercise any of the powers conferred on a court of appeal under section Section dealing with the powers of the appellate court enables the court in a case such as this i under clause a to alter or reverse the order under appeal revision or ii under clause to make any amendment or any consequential or incidental order that may be just or proper In that case the Additional Judicial Commissioner who heard an appeal on a difference of opinion between two other judicial commissioner had come to the conclusion that the conviction had to be set aside It follows from the above discussion that the appellant in consequence of the impugned direction is being tried by a Court which has no jurisdiction and which cannot be empowered by <ORG> to try him It was vehemently contended for the appellant that by giving the impugned direction this <ORG> has deprived the appellant of his fundamental rights He has been denied a right to equality inasmuch as his case has been singled out for trial by a different though higher forum as compared to other public servants His fundamental right under Article it is said has been violated inasmuch as the direction has deprived him of a right of revision and first appeal to the High <ORG> which he would have had from an order or sentence had he been tried by a Special Judge and it is doubtful whether he would have a right to appeal to this <ORG> at all It is not necessary for me to consider these arguments in view of my conclusion that the High <ORG> could not have been directed to try the petitioner case I say this for the following reason If the argument is to be accepted it will be appreciated it cannot be confined to cases of transfer to the High <ORG> of cases under the Act but would also be equally valid to impugn the withdrawal of a criminal case tried in the normal course under the Cr The section cannot be challenged under Article as it is based on a reasonable classification having relation to the objects sought to be achieved Though in general the trial of cases will be by courts having the normal jurisdiction over them the exigencies of the situation may require that they be dealt with by some other court for various reasons A judicial discretion to transfer or withdraw is vested in the highest court of the <ORG> and is made exercisable only in the circumstances set out in the section Even if there is a differential treatment which causes prejudice it is based on logical and acceptable considerations with a view to promote the interest of justice This decision seems to have influenced the learned judges before whom this appeal first came up for hearing in referring the matter to this larger Bench and has also been aplied to the facts and situation here by my learned brother <NAME> But it seems to me that the said decision has no relevance here The legislation has been enacted to give effect to <ORG> and to remedy a state of affairs prevalent in respect of a well defined class of offences and its provisions constituting special judges to try offences of corruption is not under challenge It could also perhaps be said to be discriminatory on the ground that in the absence of not only a statutory provision but even any well defined policy or criteria the only two reasons given in the order namely the status of the petitioner and delay in the progress of the trial are inadequate to justify the special treatment meted out to the appellant are applicable the direction will be in consonance with a procedure prescribed by law and hence safe from attack as violative of Article In other words in the ordinary run of criminal cases tried by a <ORG> of Sessions the accused will be tried in the first instance by a court subordinate to <ORG> he will then have a right of first appeal to <ORG> and then can seek leave of the Supreme <ORG> to appeal to it under Article There is also some force in the submission of <NAME> that if that really be the position and the appellant had no right of appeal against <ORG> judgment the Supreme <ORG> will consider any petition presented under Article in the light of the inbuilt requirements of Article and dispose of it as if it were itself a petition of appeal from the judgment and thus like the previous argument regarding Article indirectly challenges the validity of itself as infringing Article For the reasons discussed I have come to the conclusion that an accused tried directly by <ORG> by withdrawal of his case from a subordinate court has a right of appeal to the Supreme <ORG> under of the It is really not in dispute before us that there was no whisper or suggestion in the proceedings before this Court that the venue of the trial should be shifted to <ORG> Commenting on this aspect Lord <NAME> observed Under our adversary system of procedure for a judge to disregard the rule by which counsel are bound has the effect of depriving the parties to the action of the benefit of one of the most fundamental rules of natural justice the right of each to be informed of any point adverse to him that is going to be relied upon by the judge and to be given an opportunity of stating what his answer to it is <NAME> submitted that when the judgment was announced counsel for the complainant present respondent had made an oral request that the trial be transferred to <ORG> and that the Judges replied that they had already done that It will be appreciated that whatever may be the ultimate conclusion on the correctness propriety or otherwise of the <ORG> direction dated that was a direction given by this <ORG> in a proceeding between the same parties and the important and farreaching question that falls for consideration is whether it is at all open to the appellant to seek to challenge the correctness of that direction at a later stage of the same trial Realising that this would be a direct and straight forward remedy it was contended for the appellant that the present appeal may be treated as an application for such review The power of review is conferred on this Court by Article of the Constitution which reads thus Subject to the provisions of any law made by <ORG> or any rules made under Article <ORG> shall have power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it It is subject not only to the provisions of any law made by <ORG> and there is no such law so far framed but also to any rules made by this <ORG> under Article Unless otherwise ordered by the Court an application for review shall be disposed of by circulation without any oral arguments but the petitioner may supplement his petition by additional written arguments It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the present pleas of the appellant cannot be treated as an application for review firstly because they do not seek to rectify any error apparent on the face of the record secondly because the prayer is being made after the expiry of the period of thirty days mentioned in rule and there is no sufficient cause for condoning the delay in the making of the application and thirdly for the reason that a review petition has to be listed as far as practicable before the same Judge or Bench of Judges that delivered the order sought to be reviewed and in this case at least two of the learned Judges who passed the order on are still available to consider the application for review No doubt this <ORG> has power to extend the time within which a review petition may be filed but learned counsel for the respondent vehemently contended that this is not a fit case for exercising the power of condonation of delay In support of his contention learned counsel for the respondent invited our attention to the following sequence of events and made the following points a The order of this Court was passed on At the time of the pronouncement of the said order counsel for the present respondent had made a request that the trial of the case may be shifted to <ORG> and the Court had observed that a direction to this effect had been included in the judgment Even assuming that there had been no issues raised and no arguments advanced on the question of transfer at the time of the hearing of the appeals there was nothing to preclude the counsel for the appellant when the counsel for the complainant made the above request from contending that it should not be done or at least that it should not be done without further hearing him and pointing out this was not a matter which had been debated at the hearing of the appeal Perhaps he considered at that stage that the order which after all enabled him to be tried by a <ORG> Judge in preference to a Special Judge was favourable to him and therefore he did not choose to object Thus as early as th March <NAME> had given a specific opportunity to the accused to come to this Court and seek a review of the direction it can perhaps be said that on when this Court passed the impugned direction the appellant was not fully conscious of the impact of the said direction and that therefore he did not object to it immediately But by the th March he had ample time to think about the matter and to consult his counsel It has been pointed out by him that <ORG> was considering not only the appeals preferred by the accused and the complainant namely Crl A little later in the order the learned Judge pointed out that even assuming that in the first instance the trial can be conducted only by a Special Judge the proceedings could be withdrawn by the high Court to itself under powers vested in it under Article a of the Constitution as well as section of the When the criminal revisions stood transferred to <ORG> this was obviously done under Article A though that article is not specifically mentioned in the judgment of <ORG> <ORG> could pass the order under Article A read with Article He pointed out that as against an ordinary accused person tried by a special judge who gets a right of appeal to <ORG> a court of superior jurisdiction with a further right of appeal to <ORG> under of the Against the order of the learned Judge dated the complainant came to the <ORG> because he was dissatisfied with certain observations made by the trial Judge in regard to the procedure to be followed by <ORG> in proceeding with the trial Even at this hearing the counsel for the appellant did not choose to raise any objection against the direction given in the order dated This was a golden opportunity for the appellant also to seek a review or clarification of the impugned direction if really he had a grievance that he had not been heard by the <ORG> before it issued the direction and that it was also contrary to the provisions of the Act as well as violative of the rights of the accused under Art The petitioner instead filed two special leave petitions and a writ petition against the orders of <NAME> The dismissal of the writ petition reminded the petitioner of his right to move the <ORG> by other means and though this advice was tendered as early as the petitioner did nothing So far as the special leave petition was concerned its dismissal meant the affirmation in full of the decision given by Justice <NAME> dismissing and disposing of all the objections raised by the petitioner before him Whatever may have been the position on or there was absolutely no explanation or justification for the conduct of the petitioner in failing to file an application for review between and october Recounting the above history which according to him fully explained the attitude of the accused learned counsel for the respondent submitted that in his view the appellant was obviously trying to avoid a review petition perhaps because it was likely to go before the same learned Judges and he did not think that he would get any relief and perhaps also because he might have felt that a review was not an adequate remedy for him as under the rules it would be disposed of in chamber without hearing him once again There is substance in these contentions The prayer for review is being made very belatedly and having regard to the circumstances outlined above there is hardly any reason to condone the delay in the prayer for review That apart there is also validity in the respondent contention that The facts of that case have been set out in the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> and need not be repeated <NAME> contended that this case involved two separate issues for consideration by the <ORG> a the validity of the rule and the validity of the order dated and that the decision is authority not only for the proposition that a writ petition under Article could be filed to Impugn the constitutional validity of a rule but also for the proposition that the <ORG> could entertain a writ petition to set aside a judicial Order passed by the <ORG> earlier on discovering that it is inconsistent with the fundamental rights of the petitioner <NAME> was a case in which the validity of an interlocutory order passed by a judge of <ORG> pertaining to the publication of reports of the proceedings in a suit pending before him was challenged by a journalist as violating his fundamental rights under Article of the Constitution The matter came to <ORG> by way of a writ petition under Article <NAME> has conceded that if a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order in a proceeding before it and the order is inter partes its validity cannot be challenged by invoking the jurisdiction of this <ORG> under Art One of the questions that had to be considered by the <ORG> was whether the judicial order passed by the learned judge of the High <ORG> was amenable to be writ jurisdiction of the <ORG> under Article ii <NAME> also concurred in the view that this <ORG> had no power to issue a certiorari to the High <ORG> That haziness arises because the courts in our country which have been given the power to issue the writ are not fully analogous to the English courts having that power The Constitution gave power to <ORG> to issue the writ When a court has the power to issue the writ it is not according to the fundamental principles of certiorari an inferior court or a court of limited jurisdiction It does not cease to be so because another <ORG> to which appeals from it lie has also the power to issue the writ That should furnish strong justification for saying that the Constitution did not contemplate <ORG>s to be inferior courts so that their decisions would be liable to be quashed by writs issued by the Supreme <ORG> which also had been given power to issue the writs iii <NAME> held <ORG> has jurisdiction to decide if it could restrain the publication of any document or information relating to the trial of a pending suit or concerning which the suit is brought if it erroneously assume a jurisdiction not vested in it its decision may be set aside in appropriate proceedings but the decision is not open to attack under Article on the ground that it infringes the fundamental right under Article a If a stranger is prejudiced by an order forbidding the publication of the report of any proceeding his proper course is only to apply to the <ORG> tn lift the ban iv Justice <NAME> thought that in principle a writ petition could perhaps be filed to challenge an order of <ORG> on the ground that it violated the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Articles and but he left the question open He observed Even assuming the impugned order means a temporary suppression of the evidence of the witness the trial Judge had no jurisdiction to pass the order As he passed no recorded order the appropriate remedy in fact the only effective remedy is to seek to quash the order by a writ under Article There may be action by a Judge which may offend the fundamental rights under articles and and an appeal to this <ORG> will not only be practicable but will also be an ineffective remedy and this <ORG> can issue a writ to <ORG> to quash its order under Article of the Constitution Since there is no exception in Article in respect of <ORG>s there is a presumption that <ORG>s are not excluded The <ORG> in our country in similar circumstances is not immune because there is a remedy to move this court for a writ against discriminatory treatment and this <ORG> should not in a suitable case shirk to issue a writ to a <ORG> Judge who ignores the fundamental rights and his obligations under the Constitution Other cases can easily be imagined under Article and of the Constitution in which there may be action by a Judge which may offend the fundamental rights and in which an appeal to this <ORG> will not only be not practicable but also quite an ineffective remedy This is because the people understand the difference between normal proceedings of a civil nature and proceedings in which there is a breach of fundamental rights But acts which involve the court with a fundamental right are quite different It was suggested that <ORG>s might issue writs to this Court and to other <ORG> and one Judge or Bench in <ORG> and <ORG> might issue a writ to another judge or Bench in the same Court My opinion gives no support to such a view and I hope I have said nothing to give countenance to it These are imaginary fears which have no reality either in law or in fact From the above extracts it will be seen that the majority of the <ORG> was clearly of opinion that an order of a High <ORG> cannot be challenged by way of a writ petition under Article of the Constitution on the ground that it violates the fundamental rights not even at the instance of a person who was not at all a party to the proceedings in which the earlier order was passed The judgment of <ORG> was set aside and the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court under section was upheld by <ORG> in his earlier decision reported in Thereupon the petitioner filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution challenging the validity of the earlier order of this <ORG> However learned counsel for the appellant strongly relied on the fact that in this case <ORG> of five judges of this <ORG> entertained a petition under Article to reconsider a decision passed by it in an appeal before the <ORG> He submitted that it was inconceivable that it did not occur to the learned judges who decided the case that after <NAME> a writ petition under Article was not at all entertainable It is no authority for the proposition that an earlier order of the court could be quashed on the ground that it offends the Fundamental Right As the petition was eventually dismissed on the merits it was not necessary for the court to consider whether if they had come to the conclusion that the earlier order was incorrect or invalid they would have interfered therewith on the writ petition filed by the petitioner In that case <ORG> had passed an order that certain persons found guilty of murder should be hanged in public This order was challenged by a writ petition filed under article by the Attorney General of India on the ground that it violated Article of the Constitution On a survey of these decisions it appears to me that <NAME> cannot be treated as an authority for the proposition that an earlier order of this Court could be quashed by the issue of a writ on the ground that it violated the fundamental rights The answer to these contentions must depend on what the position in law is when a <ORG> entertains a suit or an appeal over which it has no jurisdiction and what the effect of Section of the Suits Valuation Act is on that position This comes perilously close to saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right in law but none if it is wrong Almost any misconstruction of a statute can be represented as basing their decision on a matter with which they have no right to deal impose an unwarranted condition or addressing themselves to a wrong question Whether there is excess or jurisdiction or merely error within jurisdiction can be determined only by construing the empowering statute which will give little guidance And there is no yardstick to determine the magnitude of the error other than the opinion of this <ORG> It is used in a wide and broad sense while dealing with administrative or quasi judicial tribunals and subordinate courts over which the superior courts exercise a power of judicial review and superintendence Then it is only a question of how much latitude the court is prepared to allow and there is no yardstick to determine the magnitude of the error other than the opinion of the court Though I have come to the conclusion on considering the arguments addressed now before us that the direction in the order dated cannot be justified by reference to Article of the Constitution or of the Cr It was possible for another court to give a wider interpretation to these provisions and come to the conclusion that such an order could be made under those provisions Lord <NAME> observed <NAME> accepted this contention <ORG> rejected it in their Lordships view correctly on the short and well established ground that an order made by a court of unlimited jurisdiction such as <ORG> must be obeyed unless and until it has been set aside by the court The uncompromising nature of this obligation is shown by the fact that it extends even to cases where the person affected by an order believes it to be irregular or even void Lord <NAME> <NAME> to cases where the person affected by an order believes it to be irregular or even void That they should come to the court and not take upon themselves to determine such a question Having said this the learned Law Lord proceeded to say The cases that are referred to in these dicta do not support the proposition that there is any category of orders of a court of unlimited jurisdiction of this kind what they do support is the quite different proposition that there is a category of orders of such a court which a person affected by the order is entitled to apply to have set aside ex debito justitiae in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court without his needing to have recourse to the rules that deals expressly with proceedings to set aside orders for irregularity and give to the Judge a discretion as to the order he will make They are inapplicable to orders made by a court of unlimited jurisdiction in the course of contentions litigation If it is irregular it can be set aside by the court that made it on application to that court if it is regular it can only be set aside by an appellate court on appeal if there is one to which an appeal lies In this context he relied on certain decisions holding that an erroneous decision on a point of jurisdiction will not constitute res judicata If by an erroneous interpretation of the statute the <ORG> holds that it has no jurisdiction the question would not in our judgment operate as res judicata Similarly by an erroneous decision if the <ORG> assumes jurisdiction which it does not possess under the statute the question cannot operate as res judicata between the same parties whether the cause of action in the subsequent litigation is the same or otherwise The matter in issue if it is one purely of fact decided in the earlier proceeding by a competent court must in a subsequent litigation between the same parties be regarded as finally decided and cannot be re opened xxxxx xxxxx Where however the question is one purely of law and it relates to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> or a decision of the court sanctioning something which is illegal by resor to the rule of res judicata a party affected by the decision will not be precluded from challenging the validity of that order under the rule of res judicata for a rule of procedure cannot supersede the law of the land He also made reference to the maxim that an act of or mistake on the part of a court shall cause prejudice to no one vide Jang Singh <NAME> at Relying on these decisions and passages from various treatises which I do not consider it necessary to set out in in extenso here Sri <NAME> contended that this court should not consider itself bound by the earlier order of the <ORG> or any kind of technicality where the liberty of an individual and the rights guaranteed to him under Articles and of the Constitution are in issue It is urged that if this Court agrees with him that the direction dated was an illegal one this Court should not hesitate nay it should hasten to set aside the said order and repair the injustice done to the appellant without further delay that in the United States the principle of res judicata governs even jurisdictional issues and that the slightest hospitality to the accused pleas will lead to a grave miscarriage of justice and set up a precedent perilous to public interest I have given careful thought to these contentions I share the view of my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> that this maxim has very limited application and that it cannot be availed of to correct or review specific conclusions arrived at in a judicial decision While alive to the consideration that the highest court in the land should not by technicalities of procedure forge fetters on its own feet and disable itself in cases of serious miscarriages of justice he has nevertheless come to the conclusion that the remedy of the appellant if any is by recourse to article and nowhere else In my view the decisions cited do indicate that situations can and do arise where this <ORG> may be constrained to recall or modify an order which has been passed by it earlier and that when ex facie there is something radically wrong with the earlier order this <ORG> may have to exercise its plenary and inherent powers to recall the earlier order without considering itself bound by the nice technicalities of the procedure for getting this done Where a mistake is committed by a subordinate court or a High <ORG> there are ample powers in this <ORG> to remedy the situation But where the mistake is in an earlier order of this <ORG> there is no way of having it corrected except by approaching this <ORG> Suffice it to say that the court can grant relief where there is some manifest illegality or want of jurisdiction in the earlier order or some palpable injustice is shown to have resulted As rightly pointed out by Sri <NAME> there is great need for judicial discipline of the highest order in exercising such a power as any laxity in this regard may not only impair the eminence dignity and integrity of this <ORG> but may also lead to chaotic consequences this <ORG> held that it had the power in appropriate cases to reconsider a previous decision given by it It must greatly impair the value of the decisions of this <ORG> if the notion came to be entertained that there was nothing certain or final about them which must be the consequence if the points decided therein came to be re considered on the merits every time they were raised It should be noted that though <ORG> has repeatedly declared that it has the power to reconsider its decisions in fact no instance has been quoted in which it did actually reverse its previous decision except in ecclesiastical cases The question then resolves itself to this There are questions of law on which it is not possible to avoid difference of opinion and the present case is itself a signal example of it It is for this reason that article invests decisions of this <ORG> with special authority but the weight of that authority can only be what we ourselves give to it The review petition was admitted after the appeal had been dismissed only because <NAME> cases and lS had been subsequently referred to a larger bench to review the earlier decisions When the earlier decisions are allowed to remain intact there is no justification to reverse the decision of this <ORG> by which the appeal had already been dismissed There is no warrant for this extraordinary procedure to be adopted in this case I have indicated earlier while discussing the contentions urged by <NAME> that some of them were plausible and that if I were asked to answer these questions posed by counsel for the first time I might agree with his answers Thus to the question did this <ORG> have the jurisdiction to issue the impugned direction a plausible answer could well be that it did if one remembers that one of the transferred cases before this <ORG> was the revision petition before <ORG> in which a transfer of the case to <ORG> has been asked for and if one gives a wide interpretation to the provisions of Article of the Constitution It will be agreed on all hands that it will not behove the prestige and glory of this <ORG> as envisaged under the Constitution if earlier decisions are revised or recalled solely because a later Bench takes a different view of the issues involved Granting that the power of review is available it is one to be sparingly exercised only in extraordinary or emergent situations when there can be no two opinion about the error or lack of jurisdiction in the earlier order and there are adequate reasons to invoke a resort to an unconventional method of recalling or revoking the same The only question that has been bothering me is that the appellant had been given no chance of being heard before the impugned direction was given and one cannot say whether <ORG> would have acted in the same way even if he had been given such opportunity However in the circumstances of the case I have come to the conclusion that this is not a fit case to interfere with the earlier order on that ground But judicial decisions also show that the degree of compliance with this rule and the extent of consequences flowing from failure to do so will vary from case to case Any order made without hearing the party affected is void and ineffectual to bind parties from the beginng if the injury is to a constitutionally guaranteed right May be that in ordinary legislation or at common law a <ORG> having jurisdiction and failing to hear the parties may commit an illegality which may render the proceedings voidable when a direct attack was made thereon by way of appeal revision or review but nullity is the consequence of unconstitutionality and so the order of an administrative authority charged with the duty of complying with natural justice in the exercise of power before restricting the fundamental right of a citizen is void ab initio and of no legal efficacy After giving my best anxious and deep thought to the pros and cons of the situation I have come to the conclusion that this is not one of those cases in which I would consider it appropriate to recall the earlier direction and order a retrial of the appellant de novo before a Special Judge I would therefore dismiss the appeal
