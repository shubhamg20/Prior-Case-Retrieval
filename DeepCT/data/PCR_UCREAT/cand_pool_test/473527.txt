The appellant filed a revision before <ORG> but failed to get relief It was contended on behalf of the appellant <ORG> had wrongly held that the Common Law doctrine of the priority Crown debts on which the case of <ORG> was based applied in the present case Even if the doctrine was applicable it was not a law in force at the commencement of the Constitution within the terms of Art and there was no scope for continuing its operation after the Constitution came into force The doctrine of the priority of Crown debts could not also be enforced because it was specifically Provided for and covered by the provisions of of the Indian Income tax Act and by the relevant provisions of the Recovery Act Rule can no doubt be invoked to recover arrears of tax but that is because the procedure prescribed by the said rule applies to the recovery of public debts and tax arrears can be treated as public debts inasmuch as by virtue of Of the Income tax Act they become recoverable as arrears of land revenue Appeal from the judgment and order dated June of <ORG> in Civil Revision Case No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The short question of law which arises in this appeal is whether respondent No <ORG> is entitled to claim that the tax due to it from respondent No <ORG> on account of the assessment years and has priority and precedence over the decretal amount due to the appellant <ORG> from respondent No This question has been answered against the appellant by <ORG> and by its present appeal brought to this Court with a certificate issued by the said <ORG> the appellant contends that the decision of <ORG> is erroneous in law It appears that respondent No secured a building contract from the <ORG> in connection with the construction of the <ORG> and in that behalf it had to make a deposit of Rs This decree was put in execution by the appellant on the th February in the court of the th Sub Judge and in consequence Money Execution Case No of was started which was under attachment as a result of the two previous orders passed in that behalf but this requisition also was not complied with till March On the st March <ORG> addressed a letter to the Certificate Officer in reply to the communication received by it from him requiring him to state why the amount in question should not be paid to the appellant and adding that in case no effective step was taken on or before the th April the said amount would be paid to the appellant A similar application was made on the th September and this application gave material details in respect of the income tax demand against respondent No In the result <ORG> upheld respondent No plea that the tax amount due to it from respondent No had a priority over the decretal amount due to the appellant from the same debtor and in consequence it issued a direction that the amount of Rs This order was challenged by the appellant before <ORG> by a revision application under of the Code The learned Judge then referred to some English decisions bearing on this point and concluded that in England the right of the <ORG> to precedence does not arise out of any peculiar quality in the writ of extent It is significant that <NAME> considered the question from a larger juristic point of view and observed that the common law doctrine was no novelty in India and he referred to the rule enunciated by <NAME> in that behalf We have referred to this aspect of the matter because if the larger question about the validity of the <ORG> prerogative in respect of claims other than tax claims falls to be considered in future it may become necessary to enquire whether a So far as respondent No claim in the present appeal is concerned there is no doubt that this claim has been consistently recognised by all the Indian <ORG> Before referring to these decisions however it will be convenient to read the relevant provisions of the Indian Income tax Act as it stood at the relevant time Act No of There is a proviso to this sub section which lays down that without prejudice to any other powers of the Collector in this behalf he shall for the purposes of recovering the said amount have the powers which under the Code of Civil Procedure <ORG> has for the purpose of the recovery of an amount due under a decree This provision prescribes an alternative procedure for the recovery of the debts in regard to cases filling under it Section provides yet another alternative remedy it lays down that if any arrear is in respect of any income chargeable under the head salaries the Income tax Officer may require any person paying the same to deduct from any payment subsequent to the date of such requisition any arrears due from such an assessee and it requires that such requisition shall be complied with <NAME> who delivered the principal judgment of <ORG> referred to the fact that the argument which had been urged before the <ORG> was that there was nothing in the Code which placed the <ORG> in a different position from that of a private person and so no application could be made by the <ORG> to recover its tax dues unless a decree had been obtained in that behalf and observed that the argument ignored the special position of the <ORG> the special circumstances and the <ORG> inherent powers It was urged before <ORG> that the democratic set up which had been ushered in this country by the Constitution was inconsistent with the doctrine of <ORG> priority but the learned Chief Justice rejected this argument and observed that whatever may have been the historical origin of the principle which gives priority to the debts due to the <ORG> when <ORG> came to consider this question the principle had become a part of the Common law of England It is not so much because the <ORG> has any special privileges in England that this principle has been upheld but it is because the <ORG> in England has taken the place of the <ORG> and <ORG> have continued the privilege which was once the privilege of the King and have afforded the same privilege to the <ORG> because they have realised that the <ORG> has certain rights and privileges which cannot be overlooked As we have already indicated there is one decision in which a note of dissent was struck by <ORG> and that is the decision in the case of <NAME> With the actual decision in the case we are not concerned in the present appeal but it appears that the learned Judges in that case made a reference to the question as to whether <ORG> debts have priority and they expressed the opinion that the said doctrine would not be universally applicable and three reasons were cited in support of this view This observation was made because in the case with which the <ORG> was concerned the hypothecation was in and the abkari revenue fell into arrear in a subsequent year and it was held that even in England the lien of the <ORG> attached only from the time when the owner of the land became a debtor to the <ORG> and since the common law has been greatly modified in England by statute for the protection of purchasers It would thus be seen that the observations in question are obiter observations and it does not appear that the matter was elaborately argued before the <ORG> and considerations relevant for the purpose of deciding the point as to priority of tax dues have not been fully examined That takes us to the second argument urged before us by Mr <NAME> for the appellant He contends that though this doctrine of the priority of tax dues might have been recognised by judicial decisions in India prior to there is no scope for continuing its operation after the Constitution came into force This argument naturally proceeds on the assumption that the judicial recognition of the relevant Common law doctrine cannot claim the protection of Art but subject to the other provisions of this Constitution all the laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall continue in force therein until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority On this part of the decision there was some difference of opinion There was therefore no reason according to the learned Judge why it should not be applied to the interpretation of statutes after the Constitution He held that the rule in question was based on the royal prerogative as known to the common law of England and it could not be applied to India when there was no <ORG> in India and when the Common law of England was not applicable It is however clear that there was no difference of opinion on the question that Common law was included within the expression law in force used by Art The majority judgment expressly states that the relevant expression law in force includes not only statutory law but also custom or usage having the force of law and as such it must be interpreted as including the Common law of England which was adopted as the law of this country before the Constitution came into force <NAME> <NAME> has also agreed with this view because he has expressly observed that the royal prerogative where it deals with substantive rights of the <ORG> as against its subjects as for example the priority of <ORG> debts over debts of the same nature owing to the subject stands on a different footing from the royal prerogative put forward At this stage we ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are dealing with a very narrow point and that relates to respondent No claim that arrears of tax due to it have precedence or priority over money debts due to a private creditor from the same debtor Does it reside in the <ORG> as well as all the constituent States If yes what would be the position if competing claims were made by the States inter se or by one of the States against the <ORG> That is another aspect of the matter which may need careful examination in future It is essential that as a Sovereign the <ORG> should be able to discharge its primary governmental functions and in order to be able to discharge such functions efficiently it must be in possession of necessary funds and this consideration emphasises the necessity and the wisdom of conceding to the <ORG> the right to claim priority in respect of its tax dues It is well known that a Welfare St ate often enters commercial fields which cannot be regarded as an essential and integral part of the basic governmental functions of the <ORG> and if the <ORG> seeks to recover debts from its debtors arising out of such commercial activities it may become necessary to consider whether the doctrine of priority can be extended to such transactions We are referring to some of the difficult problems which may arise in future in regard to the application of this doctrine because we want to make it clear that our decision in the present appeal should not be taken to deal with any of them In that case it was held that the <ORG> was not entitled as of right either by virtue of its prerogative or under any statute to take possession of the land or buildings of a subject for administrative purposes in connection with the defence of the realm without paying compensation A One of the points which arose for decision in that case was what was the effect of Regulation of the Defence of the Realm Regulations issued under the Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act when read with sub of of the Act on the prerogative of the <ORG> to take possession of the property of a subject for administrative purposes in connection with the defence of the realm In that connection the provisions of the Defence Act Vict In dealing with this question Lord <NAME> observed that the prerogative as defined by learned constitutional writers was the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the <ORG> and he added that inasmuch as the <ORG> is a party to every Act of Parliament it is logical enough to consider that when the Act deals with something which before the Act could be effected by the prerogative and specially empowers the <ORG> to do the same thing but subject to conditions the <ORG> assents to that and by that Act to the prerogative being curtailed Section prescribes the order in which preferential payments should be made in winding up proceedings the order of preference in which the payments should be made cl a gives the highest priority in that order to all revenues taxes cesses and rates whether payable to the <ORG> or to a local authority due from the company at the date hereinafter mentioned and having become due and payable within the twelve months next before that date Reading this section along with which provides that nothing in applies to proceedings by the <ORG> <ORG> held that it was difficult to think of any reason for qualifying the priority in respect of the <ORG> debts specified in a if it was intended that other debts due to the <ORG> should enjoy unqualified priority It would be noticed that this conclusion postulates the applicability of the doctrine of priority of the debts due to the <ORG> and holds that as a result of the specific provision contained in a the said doctrine must be worked in the manner prescribed by the said section and not outside it Let us first consider this argument in relation to of the Income tax Act In that case the validity of was impeached inter alia on the ground that it contravened Art One of the grounds on which the validity of was challenged was based on the fact that the recovery of arrears of income tax is authorised to be made by in different modes and manners in the different States of India We have referred to this decision because it brings out emphatically the real character of the provisions prescribed by Section does not deal with the doctrine of the priority of <ORG> debts at all it merely provides for the recovery of the arrears of tax due from an assessee as if it were an arrear of land revenue In making a provision for the recovery of arrears of tax it cannot be said that deals with or provides for the principle of priority of tax dues at all and so it is impossible to accede to the argument that in terms displaces the application of the said doctrine in the present proceedings That takes us to the provisions of the Recovery Act on which the same argument has been based The Recovery Act has been passed because it was thought expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to the recovery of public demands in Bengal There is one more provision of the Recovery Act to which we ought to refer and that is We have already examined the two decisions on which Mr <NAME> contention rests Can we say that any provisions of the Recovery Act can be compared to the provisions of of the Companies Act In our opinion the answer to this question has to be in the negative There is no positive provision in respect of respondent No claim to recover arrears of tax arrears of tax but that is because the procedure prescribed by the said Rule applies to the recovery of public debts and tax arrears can be treated as public debts inasmuch as by virtue of of the Income tax Act they become recoverable as arrears of land revenue
