Clause of the trust deed provided that the object of the <ORG> shall be to educate the people of India in general and of Karnatak in particular by a establishing conducting and helping directly or indirectly institutions calculated to educate the people by spread of knowledge on all matters of general interest and welfare founding and running reading rooms and libraries and keeping and conducting printing houses and publishing or aiding the publication of books booklets leaflets pamphlets magazines etc in Kannada and other languages all these activities being started conducted and carried on with the object of educating the people supplying the Kannada speaking people with an organ or organs of educated public opinion and conducting journals in Kannada and other language for the dissemination of useful news and information and for the ventilation of public opinion on matters of general public utility and helping directly or indirectly societies and institutions which have all or any of the aforesaid objects in view The claim of the sole trustee was rejected and having been unsuccessful through out the appellant has preferred this appeal after certification of the case under section of the Income tax Act There is also no apparent justification or cogent reason for placing much a construction on the word profit If the legislature intended that the concept of charitable purpose should be the same under the Act of as it was in the Act of there was no necessity for it to add the new words in the definition It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has received The word education has not been used in that wide and extended sense according to which every acquisition of further knowledge constitutes education But that is not the sense in which the word education is used in clause of section What education connotes in that clause is the process of training and developing the knowledge skill mind and character of students by formal schooling iii The fact that the appellant trust is engaged in the business of printing and publication of newspaper and journals and the further fact that the afore said activity vields or is one likely to yield profit and there are no restrictions on the appellant trust earning profits in the course of its business would go to show that the purpose of the appellant trust does not satisfy the requirement that it should be one not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit The present case falls within the second head of charitable purpose viz iii Where a business undertaking is held as property of the <ORG> and income resulting therefrom is wholly applied for charitable purposes such as education medical relief of the poor or for any other object of general public utility but with which object the production or income is not linked it would be still exempt The legislature had intentionally used the expression activity instead of business because in some cases the income produced from the activity may not be legally assessable under the provisions of the Income tax Act under the head Income profits and gains of business Section The question of law which was referred to <ORG> and which has been answered in the negative against the assessee appellant is as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the income of <ORG> was entitled to exemption under section of the Income tax Act read with section of the same Act for the assessment year Charitable purpose was defined in section of the Indian Income tax Act was as under In this sub section charitable purpose includes relief of the poor education medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility The definition of charitable purpose as given in section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act with which we are concerned reads as under Charitable purpose includes relief of the poor education medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit We shall see as to what is the effect of the above addition In order to see as to whether the appellant trust is for a charitable purpose we may first go into the question as to what is the object of the appellant trust As against that Mr <NAME> has controverted the submission that the concluding words of the definition viz in Kannada and other languages all these activities being started conducted and carried on with the object of educating the peop supplying the Kannada speaking people with an organ or organs of educated public opinion and conducting journals in Kannada and other language for the dissemination of useful news and information and for the ventilation of public opinion on matters of general public utility and helping directly or indirectly societies and institutions which have all or any of the aforesaid objects in view The original <ORG>ee shall have power and authority to spend and utilise the money and the property of the <ORG> for any of the purposes of this <ORG> in such manner as to him may appear proper The original Trustee shall be entitled to appoint a Manager or Managers of institutions of the Trust Editor or Editors and other subordinates for the purposes of carrying out the printing and publication of any newspaper or newspapers weeklies monthlies magazines books or other publications and shall have power from time to time to delegate To any one or more persons by Power of Attorney or otherwise any one or more of the following powers a To open one or more banking accounts to operate the same and to deposit and withdraw moneys from the same To give receipts or discharges for money or property Received by them or any one of them in the course of business carried on by the Trust To buy or sell paper ink machines books and materials required for the purposes of the business of the Trust To enter into contracts with agents dealers and others in the course of the business of the <ORG> To employ or remove subordinates and workers necessary for the work and generally to do all things necessary and expedient in carrying out the business entrusted to him or Them A <ORG>ee shall be entitled to be paid an expenses that may be incurred by him in connection with his duties as a <ORG>ee including travelling and other expenses The original Trustee or other Trustees shall not be responsible for any loss occasioned to the Trust in respect of any business or dealings carried on behalf of the Trust unless the same is due to his own fraud or misappropriation or breach of trust and every trustee shall be indemnified by and out of the funds and moneys of the Trust against any loss or damage which the Trustee might suffer in regard to any act deed or omission of his in the performance of his duties as a Trustee including any fines or penalities imposed under the Factory Act or any Labour Legislation or Press Act or any other similar enactment For the present we have been educating the Kannada speaking people through newspapers and journals and we shall be taking up the other ways and means of education as noted in our trust deed as and when it is possible for <ORG> The communication sent by the Sole Trustee to the income tax officer shows that the trust at present is carrying out only the last mentioned object of the trust namely supplying the Kannada speaking people with an organ or organs of educated public opinion It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has received The word education has not been used in that wide and extended sense according to which every acquisition of further knowledge constitutes education But that is not the sense in which the word education is used in clause of section What education connotes in that clause is the process of training and developing the knowledge skill mind and character of students by formal schooling The question as to whether a trust the object of which is to supply the people with an organ of educated public opinion should be considered to be one for education or for any other object of public utility was considered by <ORG> in the case of In re The Trustees of the Tribune There was surplus income in the hands of the trustees after defraying the expenses of the press and the newspaper Their Lordships unequivocally expressed the view that they were not prepared to hold that the property referred to in the various paragraphs of the will was held for the purpose of education in the sense that word was used in section of the Indian Income tax Act of It has been pointed out in the earlier part of the judgment that in the definition of charitable purpose as given in section of the Act the words not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit have been added at the end of the definition as it was given in section of the Indian Income tax Act The result thus of the change in the definition is that in order to bring a case within the fourth category of charitable purpose it would be necessary to show that the purpose of the trust is advancement of any other object of general public utility and the above purpose docs not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit The fact that the appellant trust is engaged in the business of printing and publication of newspaper and journals and the further fact that the aforesaid activity yields or is one likely to yield profit and there are no restrictions on the appellant trust earning profits in the course of its business would go to show that the purpose of the appellant trust does not satisfy the requirement that it should be one not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit Ordinarily profit motive is a normal incidence of business activity and if the activity of a trust consists of carrying on of a business and there are no restrictions on its making profit In taxing statutes it is used in the sense of an occupation or profession which occupies the time attention and labour of a person normally with the object of making profit Whether a person carries on business in a particular commodity must depend upon the volume frequency continuity and regularity of transactions of purchase and sale in a class of goods and the transactions must ordinarily be entered into with a profit motive We are not impressed by the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that profit under section of the Act means private profit The word used in the definition given in the above provision is profit and not private profit and it would not be permissible to read in the above definition the word private as qualifying profit even though such word is not there There is also no apparent justification or cogent reason for placing such a construction on the word profit If the legislature intended that the concept of charitable purpose should be the same under the Act of as it was in the Act of there was no necessity for it to add the new words in the definition question answered in the negative in this case by <ORG> which is now before us after certification of the case under Section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act was framed by <ORG> as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the income of <ORG> was entitled to exemption under Sec It appears that under the provisions of the earlier trust the trustee had carried on a lucrative business of printing under the name of <ORG> at Belgaum and thereafter it was shifted to Hubli where he started publishing a daily newspaper called <ORG> He said And whereas doubts have arisen regarding the legal validity of the Trust declared in the aforesaid Deed of Trust dated th July in Kannada and other languages all these activities being started conducted and carried on with the object of educating the people supplying the Kannada speaking people with an organ or organs of educated public opinion and conducting journals in Kannada and other languages for the dissemination of useful news and information and for the ventilation of public opinion on matters of general public utility and helping directly or indirectly societies and institutions which have all or any of the aforesaid objects in view he had all the powers which the sole manager of a business may have in order to carry it on profitably He had the power of transferring trust properties and funds if he thought it expedient in the interest of the objects of the <ORG> to transfer the assests and liabilities of this <ORG> to any other Charitable <ORG> or institution conducted by such <ORG> which in the opinion of the original <ORG>ee or the Board of <ORG>ee has objects similar to the objects of this <ORG> and is capable of carrying out the objects and purposes of this <ORG> either fully or partially Paragraph of the <ORG> deed He had the power to mortgage sell transfer and give on lease or to otherwise deal with the Trust property or any portion thereof for the purpose of the Trust and to borrow monies or raise loans for the purpose of the Trust whenever he may deem it necessary to do so para of the Trust deed The principal arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant trustee are firstly paragraph of the Trust deed only enables the trustee to supply the Kannada speaking people with organs or means for express educated public opinion as a mode of serving the real and expressly mentioned purpose of education which must control and determine the true nature of the activities of the trust so that profit making as an incidental consequence of these activities was quite immaterial and secondly even if the activities of the trust did not fall within the separate category of education as such in which case profit yielding became quite irrelevant but fell under the more general or the th and last category of purposes of general public utility specified in Section of the Act the mere fact that the conduct of the printing business was profitable sometimes or even constantly wag not enough to make it an activity carried on for profit In other words the added qualification or condition imposed upon a work of general public utility before it could pass the test of a charitable purpose made no difference to the law The last paragraph of clause of Section of the Indian Income tax Act of hereinafter referred to as the Act of laid down charitable purpose includes relief of the poor education medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility but nothing contained in clause i or clause ii shall operate to exempt from the provisions of this Act that part of the income from property held under a trust or other legal obligation for private religious purposes which does not enure for the benefit of the public But there is good ground for holding that the purposes of the <ORG> included the advancement of other purposes of general public utility Some of the decisions on income for which exemption was claimed on the ground that it was meant for a charitable purpose falling within the wide residuary class perhaps travelled even beyond the bursting point to which according to Lord Russell of Killowen <ORG> had stretched the concept of charity See In re Grove Grady He contended that speeches made by Members of <ORG> in the course of debates on pro visions enacted were not to be looked at for interpreting the language of the enactment to which we should confine ourselves He relied on the well known dictum of <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> when that learned Judge said In a taxing Act one has to look at what is clearly said one can only look fairly at the language used It was contended that as the meaning of words used in Section was very clear we need go no further It is true that it is dangerous and may be misleading to gather the meaning of the words used in an enactment merely from what was said by any speaker in the course of a debate in <ORG> on the subject It is true that the correctness of what is stated on a question of fact in the course of <ORG>ary proceedings can only be proved by somebody who had direct knowledge of the fact stated There is however a distinction between the fact that a particular statement giving the purpose of an enactment was made in <ORG> of which judicial notice can be taken as part of the proceedings and the truth of a disputable matter of fact stated in the course of proceedings which has to be proved aliunde that is to say apart from the fact that a statement about it was made in the course of proceedings in <ORG> See Rt In the case before us a reference was made merely to the fact that a certain reason was given by the Finance Minister who proposed an amendment for making the amendment What we can take judicial notice of is the fact that such a statement of the reason was given in the course of such a speech The question whether the object stated was properly expressed by the language of Section of the Act is a matter which we have to decide for ourselves as a question of law Interpretation of a statutory provision is always a question of law on which the reasons stated by the mover of the amendment can only be used as an aid in interpretation if we think as I do in the instant case that it helps us considerably in understanding the meaning of the amended law a Division Bench of this Court observed at As a general principle of interpretation where the words of a statute are plain precise and unambiguous the intention of the <ORG> is to be gathered from the language of the statute itself and no external evidence such as Parliamentary Debates Reports of the Committees of the <ORG> or even the statement made by the Minister on the introduction of a measure or by the framers of the Act is ad missible to construe those words It seems clear to us that the amended provisions Section in the Act of was directed at a change of law as it was declared by <ORG> in the <ORG> case supra The word involve does not it seems to me necessitate the bringing out of the profit motive of an activity expressly in the deed of trust as was suggested by the learned Counsel for the appellant The difficult question however still remains what is the meaning of charitable purpose which is only indicated but not defined by Section of the Act It seems to me that a common concept or element of charity is shared by each of the four different categories of charity On the other hand there are strong grounds for believing in the light of other provisions and profit making activities and background of the trust that the object of education was mentioned in the deed only as a convenient cloak to conceal and serve the real and dominant purpose of clause which was to run a profitable newspaper and publishing business without paying the tax on it Indeed the very language used by <ORG> in the <ORG> case supra for describing the objects of the <ORG> in that case seems to have been kept in view by the draftsman of the trust deed before us The trustees is given the power of deciding what purpose is allowed to or like an object covered by the trust and how it is to be served by a diversion of trust properties and funds Such a trust would be of doubtful validity but I refrain from further comment or any pronouncement upon the validity of such a trust as that was neither a question referred to <ORG> in this case nor argued anywhere We are in agreement with the view expressed in the <ORG> case supra to the extent that we think that a trust such as the one considered there does not just like the trust before us fall within the category of education as such mentioned in the statutory elucidation of charity which was repeated in the Act with an added qualification of the last and widest category Although the term education as used in Section of the Act seems wider and more comprehensive than education through educational institutions such as <ORG> whose income is given an exemption from income tax separately under Section provided the educational institution concerned does not exist for purposes of profit yet it seems to me that the educational effects of a newspaper or publishing business are only indirect problematical and quite incidental so that without imposing any condition or qualification upon the nature of information to be disseminated or material to be published the mere publication of news or views cannot be said to serve a purely or even a predominantly educational purpose in its ordinary and usual sense We have no evidence and no finding on these aspects of the case before us Provision for their satisfaction could be made in a manner which could be very lucrative It is what the provisions of the trust make possible or permit coupled with what had been actually done as without any illegality in the way of profit making in the case before us under the cover of the provisions of the deed which enable us to decipher the meaning and determine the predominantly profit making character of the trust For the reasons given above I think that judgment of <ORG> must be and is affirmed but in the circumstances of the case the parties will bear their own costs
