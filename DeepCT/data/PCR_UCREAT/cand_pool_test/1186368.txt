The <ORG> and <ORG>s have even the power to appoint any other person or persons to be members of the <ORG> and any member of the <ORG> other than a member representing the <ORG> or <ORG> can be removed from the membership of the <ORG> by the <ORG> <ORG> with the approval of <ORG> The corporation may be a statutory corporation created by a statute or it may be a <ORG> company or a company formed under the Companies Act or it may be a society registered under the Societies Registration Act or any other similar statute Whatever be its genetical origin it would be an authority within the meaning of Article if it is an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> and that would have to be decided on a proper assessment of the facts in the light of the relevant factors The concept of instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> is not limited to a corporation created by a statute but is equally applicable to a company or society and in a given case it would have to be decided on a consideration of the relevant factors whether the company or society is an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> so as to come within the meaning of the expression authority in Article A Merely because a juristic entity may be an authority and therefore <ORG> within the meaning of Article it may not be elevated to the position of <ORG> for the purpose of Articles and which find a place in Part XIV What Article strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality If the classification is not reasonable and does not satisfy the two conditions namely that the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia and that differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned legislative or executive action the impugned legislative or executive action would plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of equality under Article would be breached Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in <ORG> action whether it be the legislature or of the executive or of an authority under Article Article immediately springs into action and strikes down such <ORG> action Having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated for the written test is not free from the vice of arbitrariness A The court however to avoid immense hardship being caused to those students in whose case the validity of the selection cannot otherwise be questioned and who have nearly completed three semesters and taking into consideration the fact that even if the petitioners are ultimately found to be deserving of selection on the application of the proper test it would not be possible to restore them to the position as if they were admitted for the academic year which has run out long since declined to set aside the selection made There can be no doubt that if the interview did not last for more than two or three minutes on an average and the questions asked had no bearing on the factors required to be taken into account the oral interview test would be vitiated because it would be impossible in such an interview to assess the merit of a candidate with reference to these factors However if the marks allocated for the oral interview do not exceed of the total marks and the candidates are properly interviewed and relevant questions are asked with a view to assessing their suitability with reference to the factors required to be taken into consideration the oral interview test would satisfy the criterion of reasonableness and non arbitrariness Further it would be desirable if the interview of the candidates is tape recorded for in that event there will be contemporaneous evidence to show what were the questions asked to the candidates by the interviewing committee and what were the answers given and that will eliminate a lot of unnecessary controversy besides acting as a check on the possible arbitrariness of the interviewing committee The <ORG> is empowered by clause sub clause ii of the Memorandum of Association to make rules for the conduct of the affairs of the <ORG> and to add to amend vary or rescind them from time to time with the approval of <ORG> hereinafter referred to as <ORG> and <ORG> Clause sub clause iii of the Memorandum of Association confers power on the <ORG> to acquire and hold property in the name of <ORG> Clause of the Memorandum of Association empowers <ORG> to appoint one or more persons to review the working and progress of the <ORG> or the college and to hold inquiries into the affairs thereof and to make a report and on receipt of any such report <ORG> has power with the approval of <ORG> to take such action and issue such directions as it may consider necessary in respect of any of the matters dealt with in the report and the <ORG> or the <ORG> as the case may be is bound to comply with such directions There is a provision made in clause of the Memorandum of Association that in case the <ORG> or the college is not functioning properly <ORG> will have the power to take over the administration and assets of the college with the prior approval of <ORG> Clause iv of Rule confers power on the <ORG> to make bye laws for admission of students to various courses and clause xiv of that Rule empowers the <ORG> to delegate to a committee or to the Chairman such of its powers for the conduct of its business as it may deem fit subject to the condition that the action taken by the committee of the Chairman shall be reported for confirmation at the next meeting of the <ORG> Clause xv of Rule provides that the <ORG> shall have power to consider and pass resolution on the annual report the annual accounts and other financial estimates of the college but the annual report and the annual accounts together with the resolution passed thereon are required to be submitted to the <ORG> and <ORG>s We are not directly concerned with the admission procedure laid down by this Resolution save and except that under this Resolution admissions to the candidates belonging to the State of Jammu and Kashmir were to be given on the basis of comparative merit to be determined by holding a written entrance test and a viva voce examination and the marks allocated for the written test in the subjects of English Physics Chemistry and Mathematics were while for viva voce examination the marks allocated were divided as follows i General Knowledge and Awareness ii Broad understanding of Specific Phenomenon iii Extra curricular activities and iv General Personality Trait making up in the aggregate So far as the seats reserved for candidates belonging to States other than Jammu Kashmir were concerned certain reservations were made for candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and sons and wards of defence personnel killed or disabled during hostilities and it was provided that inter se merit will be determined on the basis of marks secured in the subjects of English Physics Chemistry and Mathematics only The provision made with regard to seats reserved for candidates belonging to Jammu Kashmir State was that apart from seats reserved for the sons and daughters of the permanent college employees reservations shall be made in accordance with the Orders of Jammu and Kashmir Government for admission to technical institutions and the seats shall be filled up on the basis of comparative merit as determined under the following scheme both for seats to be filled on open merit and for reserved seats in each category separately marks for written test and marks for viva voce examination marking up in the aggregate It was not mentioned expressly that the marks for the written test shall be in the subjects of Physics English Chemistry and Mathematics nor were the factors to be taken into account in the viva voce examination and the allocation of marks for such factors indicated specifically in the admission procedure laid down for the academic year but we were told and this was not disputed on behalf of the petitioners in any of the writ petitions that the subjects in which the written test was held were English Physics Chemistry and Mathematics and the marks at the viva voce examination were allocated under the same four heads and in the same manner as in the case of admissions under the procedure laid down in the Resolution dated th June The petitioners feeling aggrieved by this mode of selection filed the present writ petitions challenging the validity of the admissions made to the college on various grounds But before we proceed to consider the merits of this ground of challenge we must dispose of a preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents against the maintainability of the writ petition Obviously the <ORG> cannot be equated with <ORG> or the Government of any <ORG> nor can it be said to be a local authority and therefore it must come within the expression other authorities if it is to fall within the definition of <ORG> That immediately leads us to a consideration of the question as to what are the other authorities contemplated in the definition of <ORG> in Art We must therefore give such an interpretation to the expression other authorities as will not stultify the operation and reach of the fundamental rights by enabling the <ORG> to its obligation in relation to the Fundamental Rights by setting up an authority to act as its instrumentality or agency for carrying out its functions Today with increasing assumption by the <ORG> of commercial ventures and economic projects the corporation has become an effective legal contrivance in the hands of the <ORG> for carrying out its activities for it is found that this legal facility of corporate instrument provides considerable flexibility and elasticity and facilitates proper and efficient management with professional skills and on business principles and it is blissfully free from departmental rigidity slow motion procedure and hierarchy of officers It must be remembered that the Fundamental Rights are constitutional guarantees given to the people of India and are not merely paper hopes or fleeting promises and so long as they find a place in the Constitution they should not be allowed to be emasculated in their application by a narrow and constricted judicial interpretation Where a <ORG> is wholly controlled by <ORG> not only in its policy making but also in carrying out the functions entrusted to it by the law establishing it or by the Charter of its incorporation there can be no doubt that it would be an instrumentality or agency of <ORG> The <ORG> then proceeded to indicate the different tests apart from ownership of the entire share capital if extensive and unusual financial assistance is given and the purpose of the <ORG> in giving such assistance coincides with the purpose for which the corporation is expected to use the assistance and such purpose is of public character it may be a relevant circumstance supporting an inference that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of <ORG> We find that the same view has been taken by <NAME> in a subsequent decision of this court in <ORG> <NAME> and the observations made by the learned Judge in that case strongly reinforced the view we are taking particularly in the matrix of our constitutional system The corporation may be a statutory corporation created by a statute or it may be a <ORG> Company or a company formed under the Companies Act or it may be a society registered under the Societies Registration Act or any other similar statute Whatever be its genetical origin it would be an authority within the meaning of Article if it is an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> and that would have to be decided on a proper assessment of the facts in the light of the relevant factors The concept of instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> is not limited to a corporation created by a statute but is equally applicable to a company or society and in a given case it would have to be decided on a consideration of the relevant factors whether the company or society is an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> so as to come within the meaning of the expression authority in Article It is also necessary to add that merely because a juristic entity may be an authority and therefore State within the meaning of Article it may not be elevated to the position of State for the purpose of Articles and which find a place in Part XIV The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents Nos This being a decision given by a Bench of five Judges of this <ORG> is undoubtedly binding upon us but we do not think it lays down any such proposition as is contended on behalf of the respondents The question which arose in this case was as to whether <ORG> which was juridically a society registered under the Societies Registration Act was an authority within the meaning of Article The test which the <ORG> applied for determining this question was the same as the one laid down in <ORG> case and approved by us namely whether the <ORG> was an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> Is it an instrumentality or agency of the Government The answer must obviously be in the affirmative if we have regard to the Memorandum of Association and the Rules of the <ORG> The <ORG> and <ORG>s have even the power to appoint any other person or persons to be members of the <ORG> and any member of the <ORG> other than a member representing the <ORG> or <ORG> can be removed from the membership of the <ORG> by the <ORG> Government with the approval of <ORG> It will thus be seen that the <ORG> Government and by reason of the provision for approval <ORG> also have full control of the working of the <ORG> and it would not be incorrect to say that the <ORG> is merely a projection of the <ORG> and <ORG>s and to use the words of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case supra the voice is that of the <ORG> and <ORG>s and the hands are also of the <ORG> and <ORG>s We must therefore hold that the <ORG> is an instrumentality or agency of the <ORG> and <ORG>s and it is an authority within the meaning of Art Unfortunately in the early stages of the evolution of our constitutional law Article came to be identified with the doctrine of classification because the view taken was that Article forbids discrimination and there would be no discrimination where the classification making the differentia fulfils two conditions namely i that the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and ii that differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned legislative or executive action Now what is the content and reach of this great equalising principle It is a founding faith to use the words of <NAME> <NAME> a way of life and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch and if it affects any matter relating to public employment it is also violative of Art Articles and strike at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment And therefore it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach No attempt should be made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits Article strikes at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omnipresence It must therefore now be taken to be well settled that what Article strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in <ORG> action whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of authority under Article Article immediately springs into action and strikes down such <ORG> action Though several contentions were urged in the writ petitions challenging the validity of the admissions made to the college they were not all pressed before us and the principal contention that was advanced was that the society acted arbitrarily in the matter of granting of admissions first by ignoring the marks obtained by the candidates at the qualifying examination secondly by relying on viva voce examination as a test for determining comparative merit of the candidates thirdly by allocating as many as marks for the viva voce examination as against marks allocated for the written test and lastly by holding superficial interviews lasting only or minutes on an average and asking questions which had no relevance to assessment of the suitability of the candidates with reference to the four factors required to be considered at the viva voce examination It is difficult to appreciate how a procedure for admission which does not take into account the marks obtained at the qualifying examination but prefers to test the comparative merit of the candidates by insisting on an entrance examination can ever be said to be arbitrary It has been pointed out in the counter affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of the college that there are two universities on two different dates and the examination by <ORG> is also held on a different date than the examination by <ORG> and the results of these examinations are not always declared before the admissions to the college can be decided All this shows that there is a great element of chance in the interview test In the first case on the point which came before this <ORG> namely <NAME> and Others <ORG> and Others this <ORG> pointed out In the field of education there are divergent views as regards the mode of testing the capacity and calibre of students in the matter of admissions to colleges The marks allocated for the oral interview were as against allocated for the written test so that the marks allocated for the oral interview came to of the total number of marks taken into account for the purpose of making the selection Now there can be no doubt that having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated for the written test cannot be accepted by the <ORG> as free from the vice of arbitrariness It is significant to note that even for selection of candidates for <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> where the personality of the candidate and his personal characteristics and traits are extremely relevant for the purpose of selection the marks allocated for oral interview are as against marks for the written examination constituting only of the total marks taken into consideration for the purpose of making the selection But we do not think we would be justified in the exercise of our discretion in setting aside the selections made for the academic year after the lapse of a period of about months since to do so would be to cause immense hardship to those students in whose case the validity of the selection cannot otherwise be questioned and who have nearly completed three semesters and moreover even if the petitioners are ultimately found to be deserving of selection on the application of the proper test it would not be possible to restore them to the position as if they were admitted for the academic year which has run out long since It is true there is an allegation of mala fides against the <ORG> which interviewed the candidates and we may concede that if this allegation were established we might have been inclined to interfere with the selections even after the lapse of a period of months because the writ petitions were filed as early as October November and merely because the <ORG> could not take up the hearing of the writ petitions for such a long time should be no ground for denying relief to the petitioners if they are otherwise so entitled The petitioners arguing under the last ground of challenge urged that the oral interview as conducted in the present case was a mere pretence or farce as it did not last for more than or minutes per candidate on an average and the questions which were asked were formal questions relating to parentage and residence of the candidate and hardly any question was asked which had relevance to assessment of the suitability of the candidate with reference to any of the four factors required to be considered by the <ORG> Now there can be no doubt that if the interview did not take more than or minutes on an average and the questions asked had no bearing on the factors required to be taken into account the oral interview test would be vitiated because it would be impossible in such an interview to assess the merit of a candidate with reference to these factors This allegation of the petitioners has been denied in the affidavit in reply filed by <NAME> on behalf of the college and it has been stated that each candidate was interviewed for to minutes and only the relevant questions on the aforesaid subjects were asked If this statement of <NAME> is correct we cannot find much fault with the oral interview test held by the <ORG> But we do not think we can act on this statement made by <NAME> because there is nothing to show that he was present at the interviews and none of the three <ORG> members has come forward to make an affidavit denying the allegation of the petitioners and stating that each candidate was interviewed for to minutes and only relevant questions were asked We must therefore proceed on the basis that the interview of each candidate did not last for more than or minutes on an average and hardly any questions were asked having bearing on the relevant factors We are however not inclined for reasons already given to set aside the selection made for the academic year though we may caution <ORG> and the <ORG> that for the future academic years selections may be made on the basis of observation made by us in this judgment lest they might run the risk of being struck down We may point out that in our opinion if the marks allocated for the oral interview do not exceed of the total marks and the candidates are properly interviewed and relevant questions are asked with a view to assessing their suitability with reference to the factors required to be taken into consideration the oral interview test would satisfy the criterion of reasonableness and non arbitrariness We think that it would also be desirable if the interview of the candidates is tape recorded for in that event there will be contemporaneous evidence to show what were the questions asked to the candidates by the interviewing committee and what were the answers given and that will eliminate a lot of unnecessary controversy besides acting as a check on the possible arbitrariness of the interviewing committee
