Subject to the provisions of this Act a every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and the tax shall be calculated at the rate of three pies for every rupee in such turnover For the purposes of this section and the other provisions of this Act turnover shall be determined in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed Provided that no such rules shall come into force unless they are approved by a resolution of <ORG> The tax or taxes under section shall be levied on the net turnover of a dealer This rule was amended by a notification dated November by the addition of the words groundnut oil but this modification of the rule is not relevant to the present case which is concerned with the assessment of a period anterior to the modification Any dealer who manufactures groundnut oil and cake from groundnut and or kernel purchased by him may on application to the assessing authority having jurisdiction over the area in which he carries on his business be registered as a manufacturer of groundnut oil and cake Every such registered manufacturer of groundnut oil will be entitled to a deduction under clause of sub rule of rule equal to the value of the groundnut and or kernel purchased by him and converted into oil and cake if he has paid the tax to the <ORG> on such purchases Provided that the amount for which the oil is sold is included in his net turnover Provided further that the amount of the turnover in respect of which deduction is allowed shall not exceed the amount of the turnover attributable to the groundnut and or kernel used in the manufacture of oil and included in the net turnover the groundnuts from the proceeds of the sale of all oil by the company raw refined and hydrogenated granted a deduction in respect of the purchase price of the groundnuts attributable to the unrefined oil sold by the appellant but held that the appellant was not entitled to the deduction claimed in respect of the refined and hydrogenated oil for the reason that it was only unrefined or unprocessed groundnut oil that was connoted by the expression groundnut oil in rule read with rule and of the Turnover and Assessment Rules This order of the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer was affirmed by the Commercial Tax Officer on appeal and the appellant filed a further appeal to <ORG> The second appellate authority upfield the contention of the appellant in regard to the sale of refined oil but rejected it in so far as it related to the sales of hydrogenated oil A portion of the oleic acid which formed a good part of the content of the groundnut oil in its raw state is converted by the absorption of the hydrogen atoms into stearic acid and it is this which gives the characteristic appearance as well as the semi solid condition which it attains In the language of the <ORG> an inter molecular or configurational chemical change takes place which results in the hardening of the oil Both the <ORG> as well as the learned Judges of <ORG> held that the hydrogenated oil or Vanaspati ceased to be groundnut oil by reason of the chemical changes which took place which resulted in the acquisition of new properties including the loss of its fluidity The arguments of Mr <NAME> for the appellants were briefly two The reasons behind the rules which were designed to afford relief against what would amount practically to double taxation of the same assessee both when he purchased and when he sold the goods required that the appellants claim should be allowed In support of this submission he referred us to the Table of Conversion of groundnuts and kernel into oil set out in the Explanation to extracted earlier and submitted that the lb We must however point out that this last submission has no factual basis to support it Nor is the learned Advocate General well founded in his submission that the processing of the oil in order to render it more acceptable to the customer by improving its quality would render the oil a commodity other than groundnut oil within the meaning of the rule For instance if the oil as extracted were kept still in a vessel for a period of time the sediment normally present in the oil would settle at the bottom leaving a clear liquid to be drawn out The next question is whether if beyond the process of refinement of the oil the oil is hardened again by the use of chemical processes it is rendered any the less groundnut oil In regard to this the learned Advocate General first laid stress on the fact that while normally oil was a viscous liquid the hydrogenated oil was semi solid and that this change in its physical state was itself indicative of a substantial modification of the identity of the substance The next submission of the learned Advocate General was that in the course of hydrogenation the oil absorbed two atoms of hydrogen and that there was an inter molecular change in the content of the substance If it is it would be entitled to the benefit of the deduction from the turnover or to put it slightly differently the benefit of the deduction from the turnover cannot be denied unless the hydrogenated groundnut oil has ceased to be groundnut oil The addition of the hydrogen atoms was effected in order to saturate a portion of the oleic and linoleic constituents of the oil and render the oil more stable thus improving its quality and utility But neither mere absorption of other matter nor inter molecular changes necessarily affect the identity of a substance as ordinarily understood It would undoubtedly be very bad groundnut oil but still it would be groundnut oil and if so it does not seem to accord with logic that when the quality of the oil is improved in that its resistance to the natural processes of deterioration through oxidation is increased it should be held not to be oil There is no use to which the groundnut oil can be put for which the hydrogenated oil could not be used nor is there any use to which the hydrogenated oil could be put for which the raw oil could not be used Similarly we consider that hydrogenated oil still continues to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which is merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable thus improving its keeping qualities for those who desire to consume groundnut oil The appellant claimed exemption on a sum of Rs The result therefore is that the appeal is allowed in part and the order of <ORG> in so far as it denied to the appellant the benefit of the deduction in the turnover provided by of the Turnover and Assessment Rules is set aside Appeal allowed in part
