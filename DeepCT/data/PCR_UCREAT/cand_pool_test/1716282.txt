of Constitution of India Inconsistency between laws made by <ORG> and laws made by legislature of states Effect of In the appeals to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant Even though the <ORG> Act was repealed the provisions of the Central Act having themselves been protanto repealed by the <ORG> Act when it was passed could not be pressed into service for the purpose of prosecuting the appellant unless these provisions were re enacted by the appropriate legislature It was contended that even assuming that the <ORG> Act had ceased to exist and the Central Act applied the appellant cannot be prosecuted under any of the sections of the Penal Code or the Corruption Act because by virtue of the position that the appellant enjoyed as Chief Minister there was no relationship of master and servant between him and the <ORG> and he was acting as a constitutional functionary and therefore could not be described as a public servant as contemplated by of the Penal Code The provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act regarding the grant of sanction under of the Code to the accused is given a complete go by and instead a Commissioner is appointed to hold a regular inquiry for himself and then to submit his report An accused who has to be tried under the <ORG> Act is thus deprived of the protection afforded to every <ORG> servant regarding grant of a sanction by the appointing authority In such matters repugnancy may result from the following circumstances i Where the provisions of a Central Act and a <ORG> Act in the Concurrent List are fully inconsistent and are absolutely irreconcilable the Central Act will prevail and the <ORG> Act will become void in view of the repugnancy ii Where however a law passed by the <ORG> comes into collision with a law passed by <ORG> on an Entry in the Concurrent List the <ORG> Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act would become void provided the <ORG> Act has been passed in accordance with cl of Art iii Where a law passed by the <ORG> legislature while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the <ORG> List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the lay may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the <ORG> List an entrenchment if any being purely incidental or inconsequential iv Where however a law made by <ORG> on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with or repugnant to a previous law made by <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Art of the Constitution The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the <ORG> Act is concerned it will prevail in the <ORG> and over rule the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the <ORG> only Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amending varying or repealing the law made by <ORG> under the proviso to Art Prima facie there does not appear to be any inconsistency between the <ORG> Act and the Central Act Before any repugnancy can arise the following conditions must be satisfied i That there is a clear and direct inconsistency between the Central Act and the <ORG> Act ii that such an inconsistency is absolutely irreconcilable iii that the inconsistency between the provisions of the two Acts is of such a nature as to bring the two Acts into direct collision with each other and a situation is reached where it is impossible to obey the one without disobeying the other In order to decide the questions of repugnancy it must be shown that the two enactments contain inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions so that they cannot stand together or operate in the same field that there can be no repeal by implication unless the inconsistency appears on the face of the two statutes that where the two statutes occupy a particular field but there is room or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming into collision with each other no repugnancy results that where there is no inconsistency but a statute occupying the same field seeks to create distinct and separate offences no question of repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same field Doubtless the <ORG> Act is the dominant legislation but there are no provisions in the <ORG> Act which are irreconcilably or directly inconsistent with the Central Act so as to over rule them Although the <ORG> Act was passed as far back as December it received the assent of the President on the April that is on the same date as Act of The Act was however brought into force on the May when the new which had already replaced the old section and had become a part of the statute Thus the <ORG> about a month before the main Act came into force clearly declared its intention that there would be no question of the <ORG> Act colliding with the Central Act referred to above The provisions of would be presumptive proof of the fact that there is no repugnancy between the <ORG> Act and the Central Act nor did either the legislature or the President intend to create any repugnancy between these Acts as a result of which the criticism regarding the repugnancy is completely obliterated in the instant case and we therefore hold that the <ORG> legislature never intended to occupy the same field as covered by the Central Act By virtue of the provisions contained in Art iii That the said salary is paid to the Chief Minister or the Minister from the <ORG> funds It is thus incontrovertible that the holder of a public office such as the Chief Minister is a public servant in respect of which the Constitution provides that he will get his salary from the <ORG> Treasury so long he holds his office on account of the public service that he discharges From the Judgment and Order dated of <ORG> in No and Crl The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These two appeals by certificate are directed against a common order of <ORG> dated th May dismissing the applications filed before <ORG> by the appellant for quashing the order of the Special Judge Madras dated th January refusing to discharge the appellant under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter referred to as the Code A first information report was accordingly recorded on and four months later sanction under section of the Code was granted by the Governor of Tamil Nadu for the prosecution of the appellant under sections and of the Indian Penal Code and section read with section of the Prevention of Corruption Act hereinafter referred to as the Corruption Act The appellant on appearing before the Special Judge filed an application for discharging him under section of the Code on the ground that the prosecution against him suffered from various legal and constitutional infirmities The Special Judge however after hearing counsel for the parties rejected the application of the appellant as a result of which the appellant filed two applications in <ORG> for quashing the proceedings and for setting aside the order of the Special Judge refusing to discharge the appellant According to the allegations made against the appellant the acts said to have been committed by him fell within the period November to March Faced with this situation Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant has raised only two points before us The argument was that by virtue of the position that the appellant enjoyed as Chief Minister there was no relationship of master and servant between him and the <ORG> and he was acting as a constitutional functionary and therefore could not be described as a public servant as contemplated by section of the Penal Code We would first deal with the question of repugnancy as raised by learned counsel for the appellant Inconsistency between laws made by <ORG> and laws made by the <ORG>s of States If any provision of a law made by the <ORG> of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the <ORG> of such State or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the <ORG> of the State shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Where a law made by <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by <ORG> It would be seen that so far as clause of Article is concerned it clearly lays down that where there is a direct collision between a provision of a law made by the <ORG> and that made by <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the <ORG> law would be void to the extent of the repugnancy First regarding the matters contained in List I i the Union List to the Seventh Schedule <ORG> alone is empowered to legislate and the <ORG> Legislatures have no authority to make any law in respect of the Entries contained in List I Secondly so far as the Concurrent List is concerned both <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislatures are entitled to legislate in regard to any of the Entries appearing therein but that is subject to the condition laid down by Article discussed above It is therefore obvious that in such matters repugnancy may result from the following circumstances Where the provisions of a Central Act and a State Act in the Concurrent List are fully inconsistent and are absolutely irreconcilable the Central Act will prevail and the State Act will become void in view of the repugnancy Where however a law passed by the <ORG> comes into collision with a law passed by <ORG> on an Entry in the Concurrent List the <ORG> Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act would become void provided the <ORG> Act has been passed in accordance with clause of Article Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the State List an entrenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential Where however a law made by <ORG> on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law made by <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Article of the Constitution The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the <ORG> Act is concerned it will prevail in the <ORG> and overrule the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the <ORG> only Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amending varying or repealing the law made by <ORG> under the proviso to Article <ORG> has on a very careful and cautious analysis of the various provisions of the two Acts come to a clear finding that there is no repugnancy between the State Act and the Central Act but the State Act merely creates a new and distinct offence which in its nature and purport is essentially different from the offences contemplated by the Indian Penal Code and the Corruption Act It was further argued by the Solicitor General that there is absolutely no repugnancy between the two Acts and both can operate in their respective fields In order to appreciate this question we would briefly refer to the scheme of the State Act This is a basic departure from the provisions of the Penal Code where the word public servant has been used in the widest possible sense so as to include not only <ORG> servants who are receiving salary from the <ORG> but also other dignitaries who are in the pay of the <ORG> Section prescribes the procedure for appointment of a high powered tribunal for the purpose of holding investigation into the allegations made against any public man Every person appointed as the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner shall before entering upon his office make and subscribe before the Chief Justice of <ORG> or some person appointed in that behalf by him an oath for affirmation in the form set out for the purpose in the First Schedule Another important provision which is contained in the State Act but not in the Central Act is a provision regarding limitation Similarly section of the State Act confers plenary powers on the Commissioner or the Additional Commissioner to prescribe a procedure for conducting an investigation in respect of a complaint and runs thus Subject to the provisions of sub section where any complaint of criminal misconduct against a public man is received by the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner shall make or cause to be made a preliminary investigation to find out whether there is any prima facie case against the public man in respect of the allegation of criminal misconduct Where the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner gives a finding under sub section that there is no prima facie case against the public man in respect of the allegation of criminal misconduct he shall dismiss the complaint after briefly recording his reasons for doing so Provided that the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner shall not dismiss any complaint under this sub section unless the complainant has been given an opportunity of being heard if such complainant has not already been heard under clause a of the proviso to sub section Section gives a right of appeal to <ORG> of <ORG> against any order passed by the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner under sub section of section granting compensatory costs to the public man and runs thus Appeal against an order under section Against any order passed by the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner under sub section of section the complainant may within such period as may be prescribed appeal to <ORG> consisting of two Judges of <ORG> nominated from time to time by the Chief Justice in that behalf Section provides the procedure for examination of witnesses receiving of affidavits issuing of commissions etc Section provides for prosecution of a complainant if his complaint is found to be false frivolous and vexatious and such a complainant is liable to be punished for a term which may extend to three years and fine but such a prosecution can be launched only with the previous sanction of the Commissioner Punishment for false frivolous or vexatious complaint Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act every person who makes a false frivolous or vexatious complaint against a public man under this Act shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine Report of the Commissioner and Additional Commissioner Where as a result of any detailed investigation under sub section of section in respect of a complaint of criminal misconduct against a public man the Commissioner or an Additional Commissioner is of opinion a that it is expedient in the interest of justice that the public man against whom criminal misconduct has been alleged should be prosecuted for an offence under section or that the allegation has not been substantiated he shall record a finding to that effect stating his reasons therefor and report the same to the Government The provision under the Prevention of Corruption Act regarding the grant of sanction under section of the Code to the accused is given a complete go by and instead a Commissioner is appointed to hold a regular inquiry for himself and then to submit his report Thus an accused who has been tried under the State Act is deprived of protection afforded to every Government servant regarding grant of a sanction by the appointing authority It is well settled that the presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the onus lies on the person assailing the Act to prove that it is unconstitutional That there is a clear and direct inconsistency between the Central Act and the State Act That the inconsistency between the provisions of the two Acts is of such a nature as to bring the two Acts into direct collision with each other and a situation is reached where it is impossible to obey the one without disobeying the other It is inconsistent with the <ORG> Act in various ways including general supersession of the regulations of conduct and so displacing the <ORG> regulations whatever those may be the jurisdiction to convict the <ORG> law empowering the <ORG> to convict summarily the Commonwealth Law making the contravention an indictable offence and therefore bringing into operation sec If the later legislation deals not with the matters which formed the subject of the earlier legislation but with other and distinct matters though of a cognate and allied character then Article will have no application The principle embodied in section and Article is that when there is legislation covering the same ground both by the <ORG> and by the Province both of them being competent to enact the same the law of the <ORG> should prevail over that of the <ORG> Even in the absence of intention a conflict may arise when both State and <ORG> seek to exercise their powers over the same subject matter Victoria <ORG> <NAME> Attorney General This Court also relied on the decisions in the case of <NAME> <NAME> as also the case of Ex Parte Mclean supra referred to above where this Court was considering the question of the inconsistency between the two Central enactments namely the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act held that there was no inconsistency and observed as follows It seems to us therefore that the two offences are distinct and separate this Court indicated the various tests to ascertain the question of repugnancy between the two statutes and observed as follows Repugnancy between two statutes may thus be ascertained on the basis of the following three principles Whether there is direct conflict between the two provisions Whether <ORG> intended to lay down an exhaustive code in respect of the subject matter replacing the Act of <ORG> and Whether the law made by <ORG> and the law made by <ORG> occupy the same field where <NAME> speaking for the Court pointed out that where as in Australia a provision similar to section of the Government of India Act existed in the shape of section of the Australian Constitution there was no corresponding provision in the American Constitution According to the learned Judge the safe rule to follow was that where the paramount legislation does not purport to be exhaustive or unqualified there is no inconsistency and in this connection observed as follows The principle of that decision is that where the paramount legislation does not purport to be exhaustive or unqualified but itself permits or recognises other laws restricting or qualifying the general provision made in it it can not be said that any qualification or restriction introduced by another law is repugnant to the provision in the main or paramount law <NAME> speaking for the Court observed as follows Repugnancy arises when two enactments both within the competence of the two <ORG>s collide and when the Constitution expressly or by necessary implication provides that the enactment of one <ORG> has superiority over the other then to the extent of the repugnancy the one supersedes the other The test of two legislations containing contradictory provisions is not however the only criterion of repugnancy for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance Where such is the position the inconsistency is demonstrated not by a detailed comparison of provisions of the two statutes but by the mere existence of the two pieces of legislation In this connection the Court made the following observations Before coming to the conclusion that there is a repeal by implication the <ORG> must be satisfied that the two enactments are so inconsistent or repugnant that they cannot stand together and the repeal of the express prior enactment must flow from necessary implication of the language of the later enactment A plain reading of the section shows that there is no bar to the trial or conviction of the offender under both enactments but there is only a bar to the punishment of the offender twice for the same offence In other words the section provides that where an act or omission constitutes an offence under two enactments the offender may be prosecuted and punished under either or both the enactments but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence That in order to decide the question of repugnancy it must be shown that the two enactments contain inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions so that they cannot stand together or operate in the same field That there can be no repeal by implication unless the inconsistency appears on the face of the two statutes That where the two statutes occupy a particular field there is room or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming into collision with each other no repugnancy results That where there is no inconsistency but a statute occupying the same field seeks to create distinct and separate offences no question of repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same field It was contended however by Mr <NAME> that by virtue of the fact that the State Act has obtained the assent of the President it will be deemed to be a dominant legislation and therefore it would overrule the Central Act Doubtless the State Act is the dominant legislation but we are unable to agree with Mr <NAME> that there are any provisions in the State Act which are irreconcilably or directly inconsistent with the Central Act so as to overrule them Last but not the least there is a very important circumstance which completely and conclusively clinches the issue and takes the force out of the argument of Mr <NAME> on the question of repugnancy The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any custom usage or contract or decree or order of a court or other authority We have already shown that although the State Act was passed as far back as th December it received the assent of the President on the th April that is to say on the same date as Act of The Act was however brought into force on the th May when the new section which had already replaced the old section and had become a part of the statute Thus the <ORG> about a month before the main Act came into force clearly declared its intention that there would be no question of the State Act colliding with the Central Act referred to above In accordance with this rule penalties imposed by statute for offences already punishable under a prior statute are regarded as cumulative or alternative and not as replacing the penalty to which the offender was previously liable We have already found on a discussion of the various provisions of the <ORG> Act that there is no direct inconsistency at all between the <ORG> Act and the Central Act and this affords a sufficient answer to the argument of Mr <NAME> Having therefore given our anxious consideration to the import and ambit of section it seems to us that the provisions of section would be presumptive proof of the fact that there is no repugnancy between the <ORG> Act and the Central Act nor did either the legislature or the President intend to create any repugnancy between these Acts as a result of which the criticism regarding the repugnancy is completely obliterated in the instant case and we therefore hold that the <ORG> legislature never intended to occupy the same field covered by the Central Act It was also contended by Mr <NAME> that if the Central Act being repugnant to the State Act are pressed into service even after the repeal of the State Act the Central Act would stand repealed hence the prosecution of the appellant would be hit by Article of the Constitution i the appellant cannot be prosecuted for an ex post facto offence On our findings in this case that there is no inconsistency between the State Act and the Central Act the application of Article of the Constitution to the facts of this case does not arise at all We therefore find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by <ORG> that the State Act creates new and distinct offences and is not in any way repugnant to any provisions of the Central Act and consequently overruled the first limb of the argument of counsel for the appellant Similarly the contention of Mr <NAME> as to whether or not the prosecution of the appellant would be violative of Article of the Constitution is not available to the appellant and consequently the learned counsel gave up this point and in our opinion very rightly because since the State Act has now been repealed the question of the prosecution of the appellant hereafter under the State Act does not arise at all and therefore the question of two remedies being open to the prosecution which they may elect at their own option does not arise in this case This brings us to the second limb of the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant which relates to the import and connotation of the term public servant appearing in section of the Indian Penal Code Even in section of the Government of India Act which preceded our Constitution the provision was worded thus The Governor of a Governor province may by notification appoint ministers not being members of his executive council or other officials to administer transferred subjects and any ministers so appointed shall hold office during his pleasure There may be paid to any minister so appointed in any province the same salary as is payable to a member of the executive council in that province unless a smaller salary is provided by vote of the legislative council of the province In this section also it was the Governor who alone had the power to choose the ministers It is therefore clear that by virtue of the provisions contained in Article the Chief Minister undoubtedly performs a public duty of the nature as enjoined by clauses a to of Article There is another circumstance to show that a Chief Minister or a Minister is undoubtedly a public servant which was relied upon by <ORG> in repelling the argument of Mr <NAME> The use of words other public servants following a Minister of the Union or of a <ORG> clearly show that a Minister would also be a public servant as other public servants contemplated by section of the Code are the Code being a statute complimentary and allied to the Penal Code can be looked into for the purpose of determining the real meaning and import of the words public servant as used in the aforesaid section Mr <NAME> has however distinguished this decision on the ground that this Court proceeded on the assumption that it was not disputed before the Court that the Minister was a Public Servant and the case having been decided on the concession of the parties cannot be relied upon by the Solicitor General Will it make any difference in the case of a Minister In our judgment not These observations no doubt fortify our opinion that the Chief Minister is a public servant which is based on the reasons that we have already given and which are different from those given in the case cited before us We find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by <ORG> The amendment of the said section brought about therefore no substantial change in the position of the first appellant The result therefore is that accused No is a public servant who can be said to be removable only by <ORG> meaning thereby the Governor and I do not find any difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the second requirement of Section Cr Obviously the executive authority carries on the business of the Government and part of this business is the power given to the State Government under section of the Consolidation Act We find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken and the reasons given by <ORG> in the aforesaid case The opinion expressed by the learned Judge is clearly in consonance with the view that we have taken in this case That the said salary is paid to the Chief Minister or the Minister from the Government funds It is thus incontrovertible that the holder of a public office such as the Chief Minister is a public servant in respect of whom the Constitution provides that he will get his salary from <ORG> so long he holds his office on account of the public service that he discharges For the reasons given above we are satisfied that a Chief Minister or a Minister is undoubtedly a public servant as defined in section a of the Penal Code and the view taken by <ORG> on this point was absolutely correct in law The result is that all the contentions raised by Mr <NAME> counsel for the appellant fail and the appeals are dismissed
