The plaintiff instituted this suit impleading the husband other co sharers as parties Reference bas also been made of a suit instituted by the co sharers against herself and the defendants <NAME> and <NAME> in <ORG> wherein adoption and the deed was challenged While pleading this case of fraud it has been stated in the plaint that as a condition of adoption the plaintiff was to be in control of the property of her husband and to enjoy the usufruct during her natural life At the time when the two preliminary issues were being argued before me Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that apart from the case made out in the plaint that the plaintiff was the owner of one sixth share of her husband property the plaintiff is in any event entitled to be in possession of the property during her life time inasmuch as it was one of the conditions of adoption After the argument was concluded I took some time to give my decision and in the meantime before I delivered judgment the present summons has been taken out by the plaintiff for amendment In the petition in support of the summons it is stated in paragraph that the petitioner felt in the course of discussions in court that certain facts have not been fully stated and that the alternate case has not been properly pleaded Whereas the case made in the original plaint is that the plaintiff is the owner of one sixth share as <NAME> widow on the footing that there was no adoption the alternate case is that as a condition of adoption she is entitled to possession during her natural life even though <NAME> is the owner of <NAME> one sixth share In the instant case the fact that the adoption was conditional has been stated in the plaint even though I agree with the learned counsel appearing for the defendants that these facts have been referred to with reference to the deed of adoption There is another point of controversy between the parties viz That one paragraph is to this effect that the plaintiff claims title as <NAME> widow to the one sixth share in the properties in suit alternately and in any event she is entitled to be in possession of the one sixth share during her natural life even if the adoption is held to be binding on her It is next contended that by allowing the plaintiff to amend her plaint the defendants are being deprived of a legal right which has accrued to the defendants by lapse of time The suit no doubt has been instituted in and the amendment is being asked in This argument is tenable if it is shown that a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on the date of the application It is clear as against the <ORG> defendants there is no question of limitation How then can it be said that the claim made in the amended plaint is time barred having regard to the fact that the plaintiff still continues to be in possession and has not been dispossessed This is a simple suit for partition by one co sharer against another involving the determination of another question as to title and right to possession vis a vis her adopted son There is a substantial point of limitation to be gone into in any event a question I was not invited to decide as a preliminary issue In the circumstances it can hardly be contended that the defendants are being deprived of a legal right which has accrued to the defendants by lapse of time Next it is argued that by reason of this delay many of the witnesses have died and if the plaint is allowed to be amended the defendants would suffer serious difficulty in disproving the plaintiff new case Mr <NAME> points out that the case being already there in the original pleading there is already evidence on this point taken on commission from witnesses who are competent to depose on the point viz There is therefore no substance in this grievance This argument of Mr <NAME> has force It is next argued that this suit was instituted after obtaining leave under Clause of the Letters Patent In such a suit no amendment can be ordered if it requires a fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent This leave cannot be given and the court has no power to grant amendment in such cases In the case of <NAME> State of Bibar <NAME> laid down the following proposition at page of Cal LJ at of AIR Where by amendment of the plaint a cause of action is altered or a new cause of action added it is not a new suit but the old suit in new form In such a case no amendment can be ordered if it requires leave to be granted under Clause of the Letters Patent at the time of amendment It follows that leave under Clause of the Letters Patent cannot be granted in such a case at any stage after the institution of the original suit In this cited case the jurisdiction was invoked on the ground that part of the cause of action arose within and part outside the jurisdiction of this court The jurisdiction of the court was invoked on the ground that part of the cause of action arose within jurisdiction It was held by the learned Judge that the suit was a suit for land and the land being outside jurisdiction this court has no jurisdiction to entertain it Having regard to the decision of the learned Judge that the suit was a suit for land and that the land was situate wholly outside jurisdiction and the suit was dismissed on that ground the observation of the learned Judge on the point is nothing more than an obiter The learned Judge held that if an amendment which would alter the cause of action is made it necessarily follows that fresh leave should be obtained in respect of the altered cause of action This Bombay decision was considered in the two Calcutta cases noted above and it was pointed out that the learned Judge was not called upon to consider in that case directly whether in such cases the court had power to grant leave when the application for amendment was moved held that where the court considers that the plaint has to be amended so as to include a cause of action which was not originally in the plaint on the ground that such an amendment is necessary it is not precluded from granting such an amendment merely for the reason that it was a suit instituted after obtaining previous leave under Clause of the Letters Patent It is therefore clear that there is a substantial divergence of judicial opinion on this point There is no compelling decision of our <ORG> on the point Again it is to be noticed that in all the cases the jurisdiction of the court was invoked on the basis of the cause of action having arisen in part within the jurisdiction of the court Neither originally nor by the amendment jurisdiction of the court is invoked on the ground that part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of this court But it seems mat there is another view which cannot be ignored For reasons given above I make on order in terms of paragraphs a and of the Summons There is a prayer for leave to reverify certain allegations in the plaint as being true to knowledge and not as of submission
