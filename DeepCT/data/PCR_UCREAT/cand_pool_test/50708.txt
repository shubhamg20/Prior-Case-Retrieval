Agricultural Income is denned by Section of the Act so far as relevant as a Any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes Any income derived from such land by i Agriculture or ii The performance of certain specified acts which may be paraphrased as acts necessary to render agricultural produce lit for market and sale The Board held that the annuity was not rent or revenue derived from land it was money payable under a contract imposing personal liability on the covenantor the discharge of which was secured by a charge on land the assessee carried on business as a money lender It was held that the rents received by the assessee from the agricultural land were agricultural income and exempt from income tax and that the exemption was not affected by the circumstance that the rents were received as part of the money lending business of the assessee the exemption depending on the kind of income received and not on the character of the recipient It was held by the Board that the fact that the income of the <ORG> was derived from agricultural land did not make the remuneration paid to the mutawalli agricultural income since the remuneration did not depend either on the nature of the properties which constituted the <ORG> estate or on the amount of income derived therefrom by the estate In their Lordships view the principle to be derived from a consideration of the terms of the Income tax Act and the authorities referred to is that where an assessee receives income not itself of a character to fall within the definition of agricultural income contained in the Act such income does not assume the character of agricultural income by reason of the source from which it is derived or the method by which it is calculated In the present case the assessee received no agricultural income as denned by the Act it received remuneration under a contract for personal service calculated on the amount of profits earned by the employer payable not in specie out of any item of such profits but out of any moneys of the employer available for the purpose For these reasons their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal be dismissed
