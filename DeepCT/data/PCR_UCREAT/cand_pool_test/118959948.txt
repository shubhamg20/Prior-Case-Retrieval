This appeal is by the Income tax Officer Group Circle Ahmedabad by certificate granted under Article by <ORG> against its Judgment June allowing the application filed by the respondent assessee and issuing a writ of mandamus quashing and setting aside the notice dated September issued by the Income tax Officer under Section of the Income tax Act The respondent on July replied that the Income tax Officer was not competent to reopen the assessment under Section and that the municipal taxes were validly allowed as a deduction in computing the income from self occupied properties Not satisfied with the explanation the Income tax Officer issued a notice dated September to the respondent under Section stating that whereas he had reason to believe that the income of the respondent chargeable to tax for the assessment year had escaped assessment within the meaning of Section he proposed to re assess the income for the said assessment year and required the respondent to file a return of his income within days from the date of receipt of the notice On an application filed by the appellant <ORG> granted a certificate and the appeal is thus before us The Income tax Officer when he assessed the tax for the year was aware of the fact that the property was self occupied but erroneously thought that the assessee was entitled to deduction of the municipal taxes On receipt of this intimation from <ORG> the Income tax Officer treated the intimation as Information within the meaning of Section and in consequence of this in formation he was satisfied that he had reason to believe that the income of the respondent for the assessment year had escaped assessment and therefore proceeded to issue the impugned notice under Section read with Section of the Income tax Act The only question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the intimation which the Income tax Officer received from <ORG> would constitute information within the meaning of Section Section provides notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in Clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may assess or reassess such income for the assessment year concerned Sub section of Section enables the Income tax Officer to assess or reassess the income if in consequence of information in his possession he has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment Two conditions are necessary for invoking the Sub section the officer should receive information after the original assessment in consequence of such information he should have reason to believe that income has escaped assessment Section of the Income tax Act which the court was dealing with had a similar provision the material words being The Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe this Court was considering the question whether the opinion of <ORG> if <ORG> would amount to information within Section of the Estate Duty Act under Section of Income tax Act this Court reiterated the view taken in that case and observed that the opinion expressed by the Board of <ORG> as to valuation was clearly information This court held Jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to reassess income arises if he has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment The <ORG> further observed that information means instruction or knowledge derived from an external source The Income tax Officer treated the income derived by way of interest from bank deposits as earned income and accepted the assessee claim of expenditure on the salary paid to her daughter in law Subsequently the revenue audit staff working under the Comptroller and Auditor General of India while scrutinising these assessments brought to the notice of the department that the Income tax Officer had wrongly treated the interest income as business income and also that the Income tax Officer had wrongly allowed the assessee claim with regard to the salary paid to her daughter in law <NAME> speaking for the court held that the note put up by the Audit to the effect that the assessment ought to have been made on the reconstituted firm for the entire income of the two periods and therefore the Income tax Officer committed an error was instruction or knowledge derived from an external source and would constitute information a Bench of <ORG> held that when subsequent to the assessment <ORG> and the Revenue Audit pointed out that as a question of fact the payment of interest by the petitioner was made to his own account in the Provident Fund and as a question of law the money so paid did not vest in the Government but continued to belong to the petitioner and therefore the income of the petitioner had escaped assessment it would be information available to the Income tax Officer where it was held that the expression information in the context would mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning fact or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment <ORG> is the proper machinery to scrutinise the assessments of the Income tax Officer and point out the errors if any in law We allow this appeal and hold that the Income tax Officer in the circumstances is entitled to reopen the assessment under Section of the Income tax Act The appeal is allowed with costs
