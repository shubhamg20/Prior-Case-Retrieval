Immediately thereafter the appellant took out a pistol from underneath the chola robes that he was wearing and fired a shot at <NAME> Medical Officer PW on July at about a The doctor found fire arm injuries on the deceased and opined that the death had been caused due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of injury No which was found to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death Learned counsel also submitted that in Rukka Ex lie is the solitary eye witness examined by the prosecution because the postmortem examination was conducted the next day on at a There is no explanation available on the record nor has any been offered before us to explain the absence of the name of PW from Ruqqa Ex in which it was recorded that <NAME> and Major <NAME> had brought the deceased to the hospital That the deceased died as a result of fire arm injuries is not disputed but what has been challenged is whether the occurrence took place in the manner described by <NAME> and whether <NAME> is an eye witness Moreover we find that the special report reached the Ilaqa magistrate on the next day at a There is no explanation available on the record about the delay in receipt of the special report by the Ilaqa Magistrate The prosecution in this case came up with a positive case that besides <NAME> PW <NAME> and Major Singh PW had also witnessed the occurrence We are at a loss to appreciate how a wit ness could be cross examined when he has not been examined in chief that is to say when there is nothing in relation to which he could be cross examined The re examination shall be directed to the ex planation of matters referred to in cross examination and if new matter is by per mission of <ORG> introduced in re exami nation the adverse part may further cross examine upon that matter It would thus be seen that Section supra envisages that a witness would first be examined in chief and then subjected to cross examination and for seeking any clarification the witness may be re examined by the prosecution There is in our opinion no meaning in tendering a witness for cross examination only It will be pertinent to mention here that Act of which amended the Code of restricted the examination of prosecution witnesses in the committal enquiry in respect of cases instituted on police report only to those who were to give an ocular version of the incident only The question as to whether such a practice was legal and valid in view of Section supra and if so to what extent and in what manner it could be adopted came up for consideration by different <ORG> Where the prosecution have already got suffi cient evidence on a particular point and do not want to waste time by examining a witness who was examined in the lower <ORG> but at the same time do not want to deprive the accused of the right of cross examining such witness they tender him for cross examination There is no provision in that Act for permitting a witness to be tendered for cross examination without his being examined in chief and this practice is opposed to of the Act It does not appear from the record in this case that the evidence of the witness before the Committing Magistrate was brought on the record at all There is nothing in law that justifies such a course PW who had given evidence in <ORG> as an eye witness was tendered for cross examination in <ORG> after he made a bald statement that he has correctly stated all he knew about the incident in the enquiry Court Thus it is seen that the Bombay Kerala Calcutta Madras and Punjab <ORG> have notwithstanding the provisions of Sections of the Code of consistently taken the view that there is no procedure whereby the prosecution is permitted to tender a witness for cross ex amination only without there being any examination in chief in relation to which such a witness can be cross examined Our attention has not been drawn to any judgment of any other <ORG> which may have taken the contrary view That judgment cannot be read to lay down as a matter of legal preposition that a witness can be tendered for cross examination even without there being any examination in chief If there is some earlier statement of the witness recorded by a competent court or an affidavit filed in the trial court and the witness testifies to the correctness of that earlier statement at the trial it in certain cases of witnesses of a formal nature as noticed earlier be per missible to tender him for cross examination after he is sworn to the correctness of the earlier statement because in thateventhat earlier statement is treated as the examination in chief of the witness but that is not the same thing as tendering a witness for cross examination only without there being any cxamination in chief on the record It was for this reason suggested by the Bench that where the prosecution makes such an allegation it must keep the witness in attendance and produce him to enable the defence to cross examine such a witness to test his evidence as well as the allegations of the prosecution and bring out the truth on the record There is yet another infirmity in this case From a critical analysis of the material on the record we find that it would not be safe to rely upon the sole testimony of PW <NAME> the brother of the deceased without independent corroboration in view of the infirmities pointed out by us above which render his testimony as not wholly reliable and since in the present case no such independent corroboration is available on the record it would be unsafe to rely upon the testimony of PW only to uphold the conviction of the appellant
