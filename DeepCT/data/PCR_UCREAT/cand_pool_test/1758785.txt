There after a person claiming to be a relative of the deceased filed a complaint alleging that the first information report was false and that certain persons other than those stated in the first information report had committed the murder He made another report on the second complaint stating that no prima facie case had been made against respondent No The main contentions of the appellant before this Court were the respondent No had no locus standi to appear and contest a criminal case before the issue of process the test applied by <ORG> for determining the question of issue of process was erroneous the Magistrate making an inquiry under Criminal Procedure Code had no jurisdiction to weigh the evidence as if it were a trial the Sub Even though he may be allowed to be represented by counsel he has no right to take part in the proceedings nor has the Magistrate jurisdiction to permit him to do so For determining the question whether process is to be issued or not the test to be applied is whether there is sufficient ground for proceedings and not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction While acting under Criminal Procedure Code it is not open to the Magistrate to consider the statements recorded by the police during investigation or to consider the evidence adduced before him in another complaint Where there is a prima facie case even though much can be said on both sides a committing Magistrate is bound to commit the accused for trial When a Magistrate dismisses a complaint because there are no sufficient grounds for proceeding with the trial he shall record his reasons for doing so There is nothing which prevents the undertaking of an inquiry against one person when an inquiry is pending against different persons with reference to the same offence Appeal from the judgment and order dated January of <ORG> in Criminal Revision No of On the same day he made another report to the Sub Divisional Magistrate saying that no prima facie case was made out against respondent No Aggrieved by the order of the learned single judge the appellant <NAME> made an application under Art The second ground was that the test propounded by the learned single judge for determining the question whether any process should be issued by the court was erroneous The third ground was that a Magistrate making an enquiry under of the Code of Criminal Procedure had no jurisdiction to weigh the evidence in golden scales as was done in the present case It has been held by this court that <ORG> cannot limit its certificate in this manner and therefore we propose to examine all the four grounds taken by the appellant He may remain present either in person or through a counsel or agent with a view to be informed of what is going on But since the very question for consideration being whether he should be called upon to face an accusation he has no right to take part in the proceedings nor has the Magistrate any jurisdiction to permit him to do so It would follow from this therefore that it would not be open to the Magistrate to put any question to witnesses at the instance of the person named as accused but against whom process has not been issued nor can he examine any witnesses at the instance of such a person It was however contended by Mr <NAME> for respondent No that the very object of the provisions of Ch XVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to prevent an accused person from being harassed by a frivolous complaint and therefore power is given to a Magistrate before whom complaint is made to postpone the issue of summons to the accused person pending the result of an enquiry made either by himself or by a Magistrate subordinate to him A privilege conferred by these provisions can according to Mr <NAME> be waived by the accused person and he can take part in the proceedings is to enable the Magistrate to scrutinise carefully the allegations made in the complaint with a view to prevent a person named therein as accused from being called upon to face an obviously frivolous complaint But there is also another object behind this provision and it is to find out what material there is to support the allegations made in the complaint It is the bounden duty of the Magistrate while making an enquiry to elicit all facts not merely with a view to protect the interests of an absent accused person but also with a view to bring to book a person or persons against whom grave allegations are made Permitting an accused person to intervene during the enquiry would frustrate its very object and that is why the legislature has made no specific provision permitting an accused person to take part in an enquiry It is true that there is no direct evidence in the case before us that the two persons who were examined as court witnesses were so examined at the instance of respondent No but from the fact that they were persons who were alleged to have been the associates of respondent No in the first information report lodged by <NAME> and who were alleged to have been arrested on the spot by some of the local people they would not have been summoned by the Magistrate unless suggestion to that effect had been made by counsel appearing for respondent No Coming to the second ground we have no hesitation in holding that the test propounded by the learned single judge of <ORG> is wholly wrong For determining the question whether any process is to be issued or not what the Magistrate has to be satisfied is whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there is sufficient ground for the conviction The learned judges in some of these cases have been at pains to observe that an enquiry under is not to be likened to a trial which can only take place after process is issued and that there can be only one trial No doubt as stated in sub of itself the object of the enquiry is to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the complaint but the Magistrate making the enquiry has to do this only with reference to the intrinsic quality of the statements made before him at the enquiry which would naturally mean the complaint itself the statement on oath made by the complainant and the statements made before him by persons examined at the instance of the complainant This brings us to the third ground Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which empowers a Magistrate to dismiss a complaint reads thus The Magistrate before whom a complaint is made or to whom it has been transferred may dismiss the complaint if after considering the statement on oath if any of the complainant and the witnesses and the result of the investigation or inquiry if any under there is in his judgment no sufficient ground for proceeding <NAME> If before issue of process he had sent down the complaint to a Magistrate subordinate to him for making the enquiry he has the power to dismiss the complaint if in his judgment there is no sufficient ground for proceeding One of the conditions however requisite for doing so is the consideration of the statements on oath if any made by the complainant and the witnesses and of the result of the investigation of the enquiry which he had ordered to be made under Cr In fact two separate cases ought not to have been started at all even though there were two separate complaints giving two different versions There was only one incident in the course of which <NAME> has lost his life Reliance is however placed by Mr <NAME> on the decision of this court in <NAME> case at of the report As we read the decision it does not lay down an inflexible rule but seems to hold that while considering the evidence tendered at the enquiry it is open to the Magistrate to consider whether the accused could have acted in self defence Fortunately no such question arises for consideration in this case but we may point out that since the object of an enquiry under is to ascertain whether the allegations made in the complaint are intrinsically true the Magistrate acting under has to satisfy himself that there is sufficient ground for proceeding consider the evidence taken by him or recorded in an enquiry under or statements made in an investigation under that section as the case may be at where the law regarding commitment for trial has been stated this court has observed In each case therefore the magistrate holding the preliminary inquiry has to be satisfied that a prima facie case is made out against the accused by the evidence of witnesses entitled to a reasonable degree of credit and unless he is so satisfied he is not to commit Applying the aforesaid test to the present case can it be said that there is no evidence to make out prima facie case or that the voluminous evi dence adduced in this case is so incredibly that no reasonable body of persons could rely upon it As already indicated in this case there is a large volume of documentary evidence the latter being wholly books and registers and other documents kept or is used by the <NAME> themselves which may lend themselves to the inference that the accused are guilty or to the contrary conclusion <ORG> has taken pains to point out that this is one of those cases where much can be said on both sides Thus Where there is a prima facie case even though much can be said on both sides a committing Magistrate is bound to commit an accused for trial All the greater reason therefore that where there is prima facie evidence even though an accused may have a defence like that in the present case that the offence is committed by some other person or persons the matter has to be left to be decided by the appropriate forum at the appropriate stage and issue of process cannot be refused Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that where the Magistrate dismisses a complaint because in his judgment there is no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial he shall record his reasons for doing so It is stated on behalf of respondent No that this is at best an error in his order and therefore it is curable under a of the Code of Criminal Procedure Here the error is of a kind which goes to the root of the matter Even assuming however that the rule laid down in <NAME> case applies to such a case prejudice is writ large on the face of the corder Being kept in ignorance of the reasons clearly prejudices his right to move the revisiona court and where he takes a matter to the revisional court renders his task before that court difficult particularly in view of the limited scope of the provisions of and Code of Criminal Procedure Mr <NAME> however contends that since there is only one offence i the murder of <NAME> there can be only one trial and since other persons are being tried for that offence there could be no further enquiry As there was no material on record we could not know what happened to the enquiry against <NAME> and <NAME> after the dismissal of their application for revision by <ORG>
