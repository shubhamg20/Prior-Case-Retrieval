There were in fact six bidders for Delhi and five bidders for Mumbai It was felt that there was no need for change in the evaluation criteria as stipulated in the RFP documents On <ORG> Airport Operator wrote to the <ORG> asserting that it had the requisite qualification If in respect of one airport <ORG> was given the option of matching the financial bid of the appellant in respect of the other airport similar option should have been given to the appellant who was at the relevant point of time and even now willing to match the financial bid of <ORG> There was no justification for reduction of standard from to particularly when at all stages <ORG> had emphasized that there shall not be any compromise with quality The argument that any bidder who had crossed the mandatory requirement stage would be competent to execute the contract is completely erroneous since in that case there was no need to fix the high bench mark of Appellant has contended that the option of choosing one of the airports should not have been given to <ORG> but it should have been allotted the Mumbai airport because of its superior quality of bid in respect of the said airport There was departure by <ORG> from the norms in various cases without good reasons Where there is such departure it shows arbitrariness In view of the existence of various tiers in the decision making process <ORG> who has delegated the power of <ORG> did not exceed the powers by setting up the committees It baffles one as to how the appellant had knowledge as to what had transpired in the meetings A person who seeks relief on equitable ground should have clean conduct and surreptitious methods adopted by it cannot be condoned and this according to learned counsel for the respondents is an additional factor to dismiss the appeal filed by the appellant Various clauses of RFP which have relevance read as follows INTRODUCTION Purpose of this RFP The purpose of this Document is to Provide an overview of the process for Stage of the restructuring and modernization of Mumbai Airport Transaction Specify the terms and procedures governing the transaction process for selecting Joint Venture Partners and for <ORG> JVC to be incorporated for the Airport Specify the requirements for the preparation and lodgement of binding offers and Outline the approach that will be used in evaluating Binding Offers An overview of the indicative Transaction structure is set out in Appendix The key features of the Transaction are as follows the Operations Management and Development Agreement will be for an initial period of years with the <ORG> having the right to extend this by a further years in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents Organizing and managing interactions and communications with the potential bidders Negotiation assistance together with other advisors to <ORG> in successfully concluding the transaction Work closely with <ORG> on overall coordination and management of various aspects of the transaction i Any other work as may be required for the successful completion of the transaction Glossary Words and phrases used in the document have the meaning set out below Technical Pre All remaining Phase Qualifications offers are Management Capability assessed on Commitment and value add technical prequalification Development criteria and Capability Commitment only those and value add assessed with technical pre qualification on each of the two criteria of or more proceed to Phase Phase Assessment of Financial The offer of the Consideration Bidder with highest Financial consideration for the Airport is selected as Successful Bidder Mandatory Requirement The Mandatory Requirements for Stage Offers are as follows Mandatory Requirements for Stage Offers Confirmation of acceptance of final Transaction Documents Confirmation that the Networth criteria of the Bidder as per the requirement in the <ORG> document continues to be fulfilled No <ORG> member or Group Entity of a <ORG> member or nominated Airport Operator is participating in more than one <ORG> bidding for the same Airport <ORG> has an Airport Operator who has relevant and significant experience of operating managing and developing airports Hence there is no predetermined number of Offers that will be considered in the final phase It is to be noted that the ultimate authority to take the decision in the matter was <ORG> It was within the powers of <ORG> to decide as to what inputs it can take note of and the source of these inputs There was no question of having the view of one <ORG> in preference to another In the multi tier system in the decision making process the authority empowered to take a decision can accept the view expressed by one committee in preference to another for plausible reasons Though the word discretion literally means and denotes an uncontrolled power of disposal yet in law the meaning given to this word appears to be a power decide within the limits allowed by positive rules of law as to the punishments remedies or costs The word discretion connotes necessarily an act of a judicial character and as used with reference to discretion exercised judicially it implies the absence of a hard and fast rule and it requires an actual exercise of judgment and a consideration of the facts and circumstances which are necessary to make a sound fair and just determination and a knowledge of the facts upon which the discretion may properly operate Discretion Lord <NAME> stated in classic terms in <NAME> Hurr must be a sound one governed by law and guided by rule not by humour Lord <NAME> put it eloquently in <NAME> <ORG> All ER that in a Government of Laws there is nothing like unfettered discretion immune from judicial reviewability Lord <NAME> elegantly observed in the case of Chief Constable of North Sales Police <NAME> All ER that Judicial review as the words imply is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the matter in which the decision was made When any thing is left to any person Judge or magistrate to be done according to his discretion the law intends it must be done with sound discretion and according to law <NAME> But when applied to public functionaries it means a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially in certain circumstances according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of others DISCRETION FREE AND UNQUALIFIED The free and unqualified discretion to refuse or grant licences which is given to justices by <ORG> is absolute as well as regards the renewal of an old as the grant of a new licence In the instant case though <ORG> seems to have noted that the <ORG> has absolute discretion it has really not held that the discretion was unfettered There were four identified areas where it was noted that the <ORG> approach in the evaluation exercise was inconsistent with the terms of the RFP Essentially there were four instances of rewriting of priorities and weightages as contained in the RFP and valuation was then made by the <ORG> on the basis of these re written priorities and weightages It was informed to the <ORG> that there was no Tender Committee per se and the assignment of marks to the sub factors was done entirely by the <ORG> The <ORG> again met on th January when <ORG> dated rd January in reply to queries raised was handed over to the <ORG> Annexure From this letter it appears inter se weightage and marks to the sub factors were finalized prior to assigning scores on the offers but there was no categorical assertion that this was finalized before the exercise was started and kept seated While examining the assignments of marks to the various bidders we kept in mind the issues raised by the members of <ORG> but we were not solely guided by their views xx xx xx There are sub criterions in the criteria no out of which have further sub factors Similarly there are sub criterions in the criteria out of which have further sub factors By assigning different weightages there is room to suspect that some of the bidders have been favoured No Item Mumbai Delhi i If equal weightage is given to sub factors ii If equal weightage is given to sub factors Weightage A No Total Score as per shift Moderation due to i If equal weightage is given to sub factor and ii If equal weightage is given to sub factor and iii If the marks of sub factor given to for non aeronautical revenue less than are reduced from to others no change Weightage A No Total Score as per shift Moderation due to i If equal weightage is given to sub factor and ii If equal to sub factor and iii If the marks of sub factor given to for non aeronautical revenue less than are reduced from to others no change There was an urgency for early completion of the airports keeping in view the Commonwealth Games One of the points that falls for determination is the scope for judicial interference in matters of administrative decisions It must act in good faith must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously Thus discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires If the power has been exercised on a non consideration or non application of mind to relevant factors the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous If a power whether legislative or administrative is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous such exercise of power will stand vitiated The effect of several decisions on the question of jurisdiction have been summed up by <NAME> and <NAME> in their book Applications for Judicial Review Law and Practice thus There is a general presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the <ORG> so that statutory provisions which purport to exclude judicial review are construed restrictively There are however certain areas of governmental activity national security being the paradig which the <ORG> regard themselves as incompetent to investigate beyond an initial decision as to whether the government claim is bona fide Lords <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> appeared to agree that there is no general distinction between powers based upon whether their source is statutory or prerogative but that judicial review can be limited by the subject matter of a particular power in that case national security Before summarizing the substance of the principles laid down therein we shall refer to the passage from the judgment of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider Similarly there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers the authority In another it is taking into consideration extraneous matters Lord <NAME> observed in that case as follows Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of proportionality which is recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of <ORG> Lord <NAME> explained irrationality as follows By irrationality I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness It applies to a decision which is to outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it In essence the test is to see whether there is any infirmity in the decision making process and not in the decision itself See <ORG> <NAME> SCC <ORG> principles of reasonableness to which reference has been made in almost all the decisions referred to hereinabove is contained in <ORG> case supra In that case Lord Green MR has held that a decision of a public authority will be liable to be quashed in judicial review proceeding where the court concludes that the decision is such that no authority properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have arrived it underlined for emphasis Section of the Judicial Review Procedure Act Canada states that the Court may reject an application for judicial review of a statutory power of decision if there is mere irregularity in form or a technical irregularity or if the court feels that there has been no miscarriage of justice There was some dispute between the <ORG> on one hand and the consultant who was called upon to evaluate on the other on the question whether there is any power of making any correction to the bid documents after a specified period Whether a decision making authority exceeded its powers The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from case to case Shortly put the grounds upon which an administrative action is subject to control by judicial review can be classified as under i Illegality This means the decision maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and must give effect to it ii Irrationality namely Wednesbury unreasonableness The above are only the broad grounds but it does not rule out addition of further grounds in course of time Therefore though the principle of judicial review cannot be denied so far as exercise of contractual powers of government bodies are concerned but it is intended to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism and it is exercised in the larger public interest or if it is brought to the notice of the court that in the matter of award of a contract power has been exercised for any collateral purpose Further we find from the letter dated that <ORG> itself has come to the following conclusion The technical capability of any of the three bidders to undertake the works is not in question This being the position in our considered opinion <ORG> was not justified in interfering with the award by going into different clauses of the bid document and then coming to the conclusion that the terms provided for modifications or corrections even after a specified date and further coming to the conclusion that Respondent being the lowest bidder there was no reason for <ORG> to award the contract in favour of the appellant We cannot lose sight of the fact of escalation of cost in such project on account of delay and the time involved and further in a coordinated project like this if one component is not worked out the entire project gets delayed and the enormous cost on that score if rebidding is done It is pointed out by learned counsel for the respondents that parameters for judicial review are different in the matters of contract for normal case of tenders It is pointed out that there is no overwhelming public interest involving such matters It proceeds on the basis that there would be another eligible bidder for the other airport and on that basis the procedure to be adopted has been prescribed This procedure does not deal with a situation where there is only one bidder with valid bids for both the airports Only when it comes to a conclusion that there is an overwhelming public interest in entertaining the petition the court should intervene Same would be available only if public law element is apparent which would arise only in a case of bribery corruption implementation of unlawful policy and the like The majority of the court <ORG> said that it embraced decisions that were irrational or unreasonable in the <NAME> sense even if there was no wilful or conscious departure from the rational but it also included a finding of fact that was wholly unsupported by the evidence provided always that this was a finding as to a material matter Be that as it may the question that frequently arises for consideration is in what situation cases the non compliance or error or mistake committed by the statutory authority or tribunal makes the decision rendered ultra vires or a nullity or one without jurisdiction If the decision is without jurisdiction notwithstanding the provisions for obtaining reliefs contained in the Act and the ouster clauses the jurisdiction of the ordinary court is not excluded In <ORG> Lord <NAME> said But there are many cases where although the tribunal had jurisdiction to enter on the enquiry it has done or failed to do something in the course of the enquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity It may have made a decision which it had no power to make It may in perfect good faith have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it failed to deal with the question remitted to it and decided some question which was not remitted to it Or it may have based its decision on some matter which under the provisions setting it up it had no right to take into account There may be an absence of those formalities or things which are conditions precedent to the tribunal having any jurisdiction to embark on an enquiry Or the tribunal may at the end make an order that it has no jurisdiction to make Or in the intervening stage while engaged on a proper enquiry the tribunal may depart from the rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong questions or it may take into account matters which it was not directed to take into account This comes perilously close to saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right in law but none if it is wrong Almost any misconstruction of a statute can be represented as basing their decision on a matter with which they have no right to deal imposing an unwarranted condition or addressing themselves to a wrong question Whether there is excess of jurisdiction or merely error within jurisdiction can be determined only by construing the empowering statute which will give little guidance It is really a question of how much latitude the court is prepared to allow We are aware of the difficulty in formulating an exhaustive rule to tell when there is lack of power and when there is an erroneous exercise of it to the following effect The inferior court or tribunal lacks jurisdiction if it has no power to enter upon an enquiry into a matter at all and it exceeds jurisdiction if it nevertheless enters upon such an enquiry or having jurisdiction in the first place it proceeds to arrogate an authority withheld from it by perpetrating a major error of substance form or procedure or by making an order or taking action outside its limited area of competence Jurisdiction to decide a matter imports a limited power to decide that matter incorrectly There is a presumption in construing statutes which confer jurisdiction or discretionary powers on a body that if that body makes an error of law while purporting to act within that jurisdiction or in exercising those powers its decision or action will exceed the jurisdiction conferred and will be quashed An error of law going to jurisdiction may be committed by a body which fails to follow the proper procedure required by law which takes legally irrelevant considerations into account or which fails to take relevant considerations into account or which asks itself and answers the wrong question Errors of law include misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule of common law asking oneself and answering the wrong question taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant evidence exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons and misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof It is not safe to say that the classical doctrines are wholly obsolete and that the broad and simple principles of review which clearly now commend themselves to the judiciary will entirely supplant them Though there is no penal clause for such breach it goes against a very concept of fairness in the process and evaluation of bids Costs made easy
