The Collector of <ORG> however passed an order that the goods imported were marble requiring a specific import licence Before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appel lant that for the purpose of understanding the meaning of marble occurring in Appendix Schedule I of the Im ports Control Order it is necessary to refer to Mineral Products in Chapter Tariff Entry No the term marble therein does not occur by itself or in isolation bal as an inseverable part of a Tariff Entry which deals with five items a Marble Travertine Ecaussine Other calcareous stone Alabaster the Tariff Entry draws a clear line of distinction between each of these five items and regards them as five distinct products the term marble has to be given a meaning which fits in and harmonises in the above mentioned statutory context so that marble continues to remain distinct and different from the said other four items though the general principle of interpretation of tariff entries occurring in a tax statute is that of commer cial nomenclature or understanding in the trade the said doctrine or commercial nomenclature or trade understanding can and should be departed from in a case where the statuto ry context in which the tariff item appears requires such a departure the principles of interpretation are never embodied rules and the same must always yield to the context of the particular statute as the word marble has not been defined and the tariff item refers to calcareous stone of an apparent spe cific gravity of or more has to be taken to be used in a technical and scientific sense and as such the same cannot be interpreted in the popular commercial sense the end use of the particular product is irrelevant and of no consequence for determining its classification and if the term marble is to be given the commercial meaning as relied upon by <ORG> then the inevitable consequence would be that the term marble in Chapter Heading would automatically include within it the other four items thereby rendering the rest of the Tariff Entry otiose redundant and meaningless Calcareous stone as mentioned in ITC Schedule has to be taken in scientific and technical sense as therein the said stone has been described as of an apparent specific gravity of or more Therefore the word marble has to be interpreted in the scientific or technical sense and not in the sense as commercially understood or as meant in the trade parlance Trade meaning or commercial nomenclature would be applicable if a particular product description occurs by itself in a Tariff Entry and there is no conflict between the Tariff Entry and any other Entry requiring to reconcile and harmonise that Tariff Entry with any other Entry The most vital question that comes up for consideration in this appeal is whether marble as mentioned in Tariff Item No in Appendix Schedule I to the Import Con trol Order mentioning Marble travertine ecaussine and other calcareous monumental or building stone of an apparent specific gravity of or more and Alabaster whether or not roughly trimmed or merely cut by sawing or otherwise into blocks or slabs of a rectangular including square shape is genus within which a other kinds of calcareous stones are included or whether marble is a dis tinct or different item which is one of the restricted item in the List of Restricted Items described in Appendix Part of Import and Export Policy for April March Para of the said Specification provides that The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this standard has taken into consideration the views of producers consumers and technologists and has related the standard to the manufacturing and trade practices followed in the country in this field The appellant also obtained the certificate dated Decem ber from one <NAME> a Surveyor regis tered with <ORG> Carrara and a Specialist for stones The appellant filed a Bill of Entry No dated for clearance of the goods for home consumption The appellant set out the correct position and informed the <ORG> by several letters dated th February th February th February and th February that the said goods could not be regarded as marble in terms of the expression marble appearing in heading in Schedule I Appendix I <ORG> Tariff Amendment Act The appellant accordingly cleared of the imported consignment The appellant also by a letter dated Febru ary sent a sample of the same consignment for testing to the <ORG> The appellant addressed further letters dated March March to <ORG> The appellant on March received a letter dated March from <ORG> enclosing the test report on the sample of the imported goods submit ted by the appellant to <ORG> The Collector of <ORG> New <ORG> House Ballard Estate Bombay passed an order that the goods imported are marble and thus require a specific import licence However the importer was given option to clear the said goods for home consumption on payment of fine of Rs in lieu of confiscation under Section of the <ORG> Act the option to be exercised within days from the date of receipt of the said order Against this order the appellant filed a writ petition being Writ Petition No of which was dismissed at the admission stage on the ground that it involves disputed questions of fact which were difficult to be decided in a writ jurisdiction The appellant thereaf ter filed the said appeal before <ORG> West Regional Bench Bombay to Rs Feeling aggrieved by the said order the appellant filed the instant appeal under Section of the Customs Act In the said Appendix I Schedule I states that each heading number in Column corresponds to the respective Chapter and heading number of the first Schedule to the Customs Tariff Amendment Act as amended on and each entry in Column has the same scope and meaning as the corresponding Chapter and heading of the said first Schedule Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has submitted that for the purpose of understand ing the meaning of marble occurring in Appendix I Schedule I of the Imports Control Order it is neces sary to refer to Mineral Products in Chapter Tariff Entry No which refers to Marble Travertine Ecaus sine and other calcareous monumental and building stone of an apparent specific gravity of or more and Alabaster whether or not roughly trimmed or merely cut by sawing or otherwise into blocks or slabs of a rectangular including square shape The term marble has to be given a meaning which fits in and harmonises in the above mentioned statuto ry context so that marble continues to remain distinct and different from the said other four items It has therefore been submitted on behalf of the appellant that the term marble has to be interpreted in a manner which is in consonance with the context and which does not militate against it It has been secondly submitted on behalf of <ORG> that the general principle of interpretation of tariff entries occurring in a tax statute is that of commercial nomenclature or understanding in the trade It has also been submitted in this connection that the trade meaning or commercial nomenclature would be applicable if a particular product description occurs by itself in a Tariff Entry and there is no competition between that Tariff Entry and any other tariff entry nor is there any need to reconcile and harmonise that tariff entry with any other It has also been contended on behalf of the appellant that from the language of the Tariff Entry itself it is only the technical meaning which can be applied for interpreting Chapter Heading The expres sions calcareous travertine ecaussine and alabaster are all technical expressions known to the science of Geology which are found defined in dictionaries of Geology It has also been submitted that the said <ORG> also con tains specific note regarding serpentine rocks to the effect that the same are sometimes called Marble but the same is excluded from Chapter Heading This clearly shows that according to <ORG> Chapter Heading must be construed according to its technical meaning It has therefore been submitted that the findings arrived at by <ORG> that the calcareous stone slab imported by the appellant is marble as understood in the commercial or trade nomenclature and as such the import of the said slab being without a licence is subject to the liability of confiscation and imposition of penalty and wholly unwarranted It is further submitted that it is not a scientific or technical word and as such it does not require to be interpreted in its scientific and technical sense He has cited certain decisions in support of his above contention He further submitted that the ISI specification for marble as referred to in IS item No which defines marble as metamorphic rocks can not be applied in the instant case especially in view of the note to the said item that sometimes rocks such as serpentine are also polished and used in trade as marble Mr <NAME> therefore submitted that there is no infirmity in the findings and conclusions of <ORG> and as such the calcareous stone slabs imported by the appellant being marble one of the restricted items the order of confiscation of the said stone slabs and in lieu thereof the imposition of the cus toms duty and the penalty is quite in accordance with law The sole question to be considered in this appeal is whether the word calcareous monumental or building stones of more than or more specific gravity as mentioned in Tariff Item No in Appendix Schedule commonly known as ITC Schedule to the Imports Control Order comes within the purview of the restricted items mentioned in Item Appendix Part of the Import and Export Policy April March to the Appendix Schedule I to the Imports Control Order which is to the following effect Note Each heading number in Column corresponds to the respective Chapter and heading number of this first Schedule to the Customs Tariff Amendment Act as amend ed on and each entry in Column has the same scope and meaning as the corresponding Chapter and heading of the said first Schedule Section of the Imports and Exports Control Act as amended upto th April provides that The Central Government may by order published in the Official Gazette make provisions for prohibiting restrict ing or otherwise controlling in all cases or in specified classes of cases and subject to such exceptions if any as may be made by or under the order Chapter of Schedule I Appendix i of the ITC Sched ule mentions mineral products which can be imported under Entry No refers to marble which is as under Marble travertine ecaussine and other calcareous monumen tal or building stone of an apparent specific gravity of or more and Alabaster whether or not roughly trimmed or merely cut by sawing or otherwise into blocks or slabs of a rectangular including square shape It has been stated in the said report that the sample is a limestone and thus differs from the marble in being of sedimentary origin and has not undergone any metamorphism to be considered under metamorphic rocks to be described as a marble The appellant also obtained a certificate from one <NAME> a survey or registered with <ORG> Carrara and a specialist for control of marble calcareous stones other than Marble and Granite It has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that as the word marble has not been defined and the tariff item refers to calcareous stone of an apparent specific gravity of or more it has to be taken to be used in a technical and scientific sense and as such the same cannot be interpreted in the popular commercial sense or as understood in trade parlance by persons dealing with the said stones Moreover the calcareous stone as mentioned in ITC Schedule has to be taken in scientific and technical sense as therein the said stone has been described as of an apparent specific gravity of or more Therefore the word marble has to be interpreted in our considered opinion in the scientific or technical sense and not in the sense as commercially under stood or as meant in the trade parlance There is no doubt that the general principle of interpretation of Tariff Entries occurring in a text statute is of a commercial nomenclature and understanding between persons in the trade but it is also a settled legal position that the said doc trine of commercial nomenclature or trade understanding should be departed from in a case where the statutory con tent in which the Tariff Entry appears requires such a departure Trade meaning or commercial nomenclature would be applicable if a particular product description occurs by itself in a Tariff Entry and there is no conflict between the Tariff Entry and any other Entry requiring to reconcile and harmo nise that Tariff Entry with any other Entry There was no competition between that Tariff Entry with any other nor was there any need to reconcile and harmonise the said entry with any other provision of the tariff Viewed from this angle both a merchant dealing in coal and a consumer wanting to purchase it would regard coal not in its geological sense but in these sense as ordinarily understood and would include charcoal in the term coal It may be pointed out that this Court has clearly and unequivocally laid down that it is not permissible but in fact it is absolutely necessary to depart from the trade meaning or commercial nomenclature test where the trade or commercial meaning does not fit into the scheme of the commercial statements The <ORG> has also referred to the observations of <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> Ch Referring to the above decisions this <ORG> held that While construing the word coal in Entry of Part III of Schedule II the test that would be applied is what would be the meaning which persons dealing with coal and consumers purchasing it as fuel would give to that word A sales tax statute is being one levying a tax on goods must in the absence of a technical term or a term of science or art be presumed to have used an ordinary term as coal according to the meaning ascribed to it in common parlance The word hank as used in the Notification meant a coil of yarn and nothing more SCC it has been observed by this <ORG> that it is a well settled principle of construction that where the word has a scientific or technical meaning and also in ordinary meaning according to common parlance it is in the latter sense that in a taxing statute the word must be held to have been used unless contrary intention is clearly expressed by the legislature Where howev er there is no evidence either way then the definition given and the meaning flowing from particular statute at particular time would be the decisive test It has further been observed by this <ORG> in this case that Where no definition is provided in the statute itself as in this case for ascertaining the correct mean ing of a fiscal entry reference to a dictionary is not always safe The correct guide it appears in such a case is the context and the trade meaning The importer had imported skimmed milk powder and relied upon the principle of commercial nomenclature or trade understanding in order to contend that there was a settled and accepted distinction between milk powder and skimmed milk powder which was specifically recognised and accepted by this Court in <ORG> State of Haryana It may be understood as in most of financial measures where the expressions are not defined not in a technical or pre conceived basis but on the basis of trade understanding of those who deal with these goods When no statutory definition is provided in respect of an item in the Customs Act or the Central Excises Act the trade understanding meaning thereby the understanding in the opinion of those who deal with the goods in question is the safest guide On a conspectus of all these decisions mentioned herein before the position thus emerges is that when the expression marble has not been defined in the Customs Tariff Act as well as in the Customs Act or in the relevant Notification regarding the restriction on import of Marble in the List of Restricted Articles it is necessary to decide the signifi cance and true meaning of the word marble as used in the ITC Schedule as well as in the List of Restricted Items Customs Tariff Act and the Customs Act not in its popular sense i people who are dealing with this trade meant the same or what that term is commercially known in trade par lance but it has to be given a meaning in the context in which this word has been used in the ITC Schedule as well as in the List of Restricted items of Import but there are pure white varieties It has been further stated under the said report that the specimen has been examined and it is observed that the rock is cryptocrystalline fine grained mildly metamorphosed with few bigger grains of calcite It has been stated in the said report that the sample is of a fine grained off white rock it is of course well settled that in Taxing Statute the words used are to be understood in the common parlance or commercial parlance but such a trade understanding or commercial nomenclature can be given only in cases where the word in the Tariff Entry has not been used in a scientific or technical sense and where there is no conflict between the words used in the Tariff Entry and any other Entry in the Tariff Schedule Although much stress has been laid on the note to Item No of Indian Standards Specification for Marble Blocks Slabs and Tiles wherein it has been stated that some times rocks such as serpentine are also polished and used in trade as marble but it cannot be taken into consideration in coming to the finding that marble is the genus and all the other calcareous stones referred to in Tariff Entry No in ITC Schedule Appendix I are included in it Moreover he referred the sample of the calcareous stone to be imported to <ORG> Bombay and to <ORG> of <ORG> to ascertain wheth er calcareous stone in question is marble or not in order to enable him to import the same under open general licence In other words a harmonised interpretation has to be given to each of the calcareous stones mentioned in the said Tariff Item in ITC Schedule and nothing should be left out or made redundant in giving the interpretation Considering all these aspects there is no other alter native but to conclude that the slabs of calcareous stone imported by the appellant are not marble as mentioned in Entry No of Appendix of the Import and Export Policy for April March and so it is covered by open general licence A penalty will ordinarily be imposed in cases where the party acts deliberately in defiance of law or is guilty of contumacious or dishonest conduct or acts in conscious disregard of its obligation but not in cases where there is a technical or venial breach of the provisions of the Act or where the breach flows from a bona fide belief that the offender is not liable to act in the manner prescribed by the statute In the premises aforesaid we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by <ORG> and direct the <ORG> to release the goods to the appellant forthwith We also direct the <ORG> to release the personal bond given by the Appellant for a sum of Rs on the basis of which one container wasreleased as per order of this Court dated October and also to release the appellant from payment of detention charges and demurrage for retaining the goods
