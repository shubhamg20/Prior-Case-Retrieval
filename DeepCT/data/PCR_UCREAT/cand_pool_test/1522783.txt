This appeal by the assessee is directed against the order of the CIT A on following grounds That the CIT A erred on facts and in law in confirming the addition of Rs to the valuation of closing stock by not accepting the change in the method of valuation of closing of levy sugar to lower of cost or realizable value from lower of cost or average realizable value of levy and free sale sugar That the CIT A erred on facts and in law in confirming disallowance of expenditure of Rs on repairs at the residence of employees as non business expenditure That the CIT A erred on facts and in law in confirming the action of the AO in disallowing deduction for interest accrued but not due amounting to Rs lakh is also without any basis and is admittedly a liability which may arise in future The assessee was asked to explain as to why this change should be accepted and through its written submissions it was stated on behalf of the assessee that the change in the method of valuation is in accordance with the guidelines of <ORG> that the inventories should be valued at lower historical cost and net realizable value The <ORG> has noted that upto AY the assessee had been continuously following a particular method for valuing the closing stock of sugar but suddenly in AY in changed the method of valuing the closing stock of sugar and third method was followed only upto the next year i and in the AY the assessee again reverted back to his old method The <ORG> has observed that the assessee had changed its method of valuing the closing stock with the intent to avoid incidence of tax resorted by record growth in turnover and in profits He further pleaded that the assessee would have no objection if the same method adopted in the year under appeal is consistently adopted in tax assessments in all subsequent assessment years The CIT A re examined the issue in the light of various case laws referred to before him and confirmed the addition after making the following observations I have carefully considered the submissions of the appellant the observations made in the assessment order as well as the facts of the case In any case the subsequent events show that the method adopted in the year under appeal has not been followed consistently in future It was held in the case of <ORG> Vs Food Specialties ITR that such change was permissible when it was bona fide and not for the purpose of evading tax It was held by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> Vs CIT ITR that there could be no splitting up of the stock of sugar and its valuation at different rates Aggrieved the assessee has preferred an appeal before the <ORG> and besides reiterting its earlier contentions it contended before us that the assessee was to sell its production of sugar at levy price and market price at a rate determined by the <ORG> from time to time During the previous year the assessee changed its method of valuation of closing stock treating levy of sugar as a separate product as the assessee was advised that such method of closing stock is more rational and scientific It was further contended on behalf of the assessee that the subsequent change in the method of valuation during the previous year relevant to the AY may call for being rejected but that change cannot result in the present change being rejected DR on the other hand besides relying upon the order of the CIT A has emphatically argued that the assessee had been consistently following an average method of valuing the stock of sugar upto the AY and the same was duly accepted by the <ORG> This change in method was valued upto the AY and again in AY the assessee reverted back to its old method of valuation of closing stock of sugar DR further submitted that it has been repeatedly held that the assessee has a right to change its method of accounting or valuation of closing stock but it should be bona fide and continuously followed in succeeding years Again in AY the assessee itself has reverted back to its old method of valuation of closing stock Counsel for the assessee could not satisfactorily explain as to why he has reverted back to its old method of valuation in AY and for what reasons now the assessee is submitting that the method adopted during the AY and must be followed in succeeding years after rejecting the method of valuation adopted by the assessee for valuing its stock for the AY In the previous year relevant to the AY the assessee valued the closing stock by bifurcating the closing stock into levy sugar and free sugar The assessee accordingly valued its closing stock of levy sugar at Rs Since nothing has been placed on record to prove that the change in method of valuation during the impugned assessment year is bona fide except the oral submission that this changed method is more scientific and rational we have no hesitation in holding that the change in method of valuation is not bona fide and is not regularly followed We therefore do not find any infirmity in the order of the CIT A Accordingly we confirm his order We have heard the rival submissions and carefully perused the orders of the authorities below and documents placed on record Aggrieved the assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT A with the submission that the aluminium material is very convenient to install and its cost compares favourably with wooden items of similar quality Aggrieved the assessee preferred an appeal before the <ORG> with the submission that entry I of Appendix I of the IT Rules while talking of purely temporary erection such as wooden structures refers to wooden structures merely by way of an example In support of his contention he placed reliance upon the following judgments <ORG> Vs CIT ITR SC CIT Vs <ORG> ITR SC CIT Vs <ORG> ITR <ORG> Vs CIT ITR Del ITO Vs <ORG> ITD <ORG> Vs ITo ITD tm Delhi <ORG> Vs ITO ITD Synthetics Vs ITO ITD Delhi <NAME> on the other hand has submitted that by claiming depreciation at of these aluminium partitions and structures by treating it to be a temporary erection the assessee itself has treated this expenditure as a capital expenditure and the same stand was taken by the assessee even upto the first appellate authority To determine that nature of erection one has to look into the nature of material used in erection But during the course of hearing the assessee has raised a new claim that these expenditures should be treated as revenue expenditure and deduction of the same should be allowed while computing business income of the assessee We therefore confine ourselves to the moot question whether the expenditures were incurred to raise a temporary erection entitling the assessee to depreciation at In the instant case the assessee has incurred certain expenditure on wooden partition on which depreciation was allowed at but on aluminium erection the <ORG> has allowed depreciation at only for the reason that life span of aluminium structure is more that the wooden partition We therefore do not find any infirmity in the order of the CIT A Accordingly we confirms his order on this court Having considered the rival submissions and from a perusal of record that the assessee has claimed an expenditure incurred on fixing side units at the residence of the Vice President of the company as per bill dated of <ORG> as business expenditure but the AO had disallowed the same on the ground that this expenditure was incurred for non business purposes the assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT A but did not find favour with him Ground no relates to the disallowance of deduction of interest accrued but not due amounting to Rs The assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT A with the submission that as per the terms of loan agreement the interest accrued from day to day though the same is to be repaid in instalments commencing from he further placed reliance on Section iii and of the IT Act and emphasized that provisions of Section are not attracted at all He further held that Section clearly applies to the case of the assessee and according to this Section if interest is not paid it cannot be allowed Now the assessee has preferred an appeal before the <ORG> with the submission that Section iii of the Act allows deduction for interest paid in respect of capital borrowed for the purpose of business or profession and as per Section the word paid means the actually paid or incurred according to the method of accounting on the basis of which profits or gains are computed under the head profits and gains of business and profession <ORG> Ld<ORG> DR on the other hand has submitted that the <ORG><ORG> always operates through its financing agencies and Section sub section deals with the payment of interest on any loan or borrowings from any public financial institution or state financial institution or <ORG><ORG> As such the payment of interest to <ORG> cannot be called to be a direct payment to the <ORG> of India for taking the case out of the purview of Section of the Act<ORG> He further submitted that Section is a non obstantie clause starting with notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of this Act <ORG> It means it has an overriding effect on other provisions of this Act and according to it deductions are otherwise allowable under this Act in respect of different payments given in sub section a to of on payment basis<ORG> The Ld<ORG> DR further submits that since as per the agreement repayment of interest accrued thereon starts w<ORG>e<ORG>f<ORG> <ORG> <ORG> the interest alone cannot be claimed to have been accrued during the impugned assessment year<ORG> We have carefully examined the facts of the case in the light of legal provisions and we find that the assessee is only entitled to claim the payment of interest when it becomes due and not prior to that In this background we do not find any infirmity in the order of the CIT A Accordingly we confirm his order From a careful perusal of record on this issue we find that the assessee has claimed in its revised computation filed during the course of assessment proceeding that a sum of Rs The assessee preferred an appeal before <ORG> with the submission that as per <ORG> directions the assessee was required to pay half of the amount which became due in monthly installments with interest of from the date of the order and for the balance amount the assessee had to furnish a bank guarantee inclusive of interest on Since the assessee has complied with the directions of <ORG> it raised a claim and its liability of payment cannot be treated as a contingent liability The claim of the assessee was re examined by <ORG> in the light of various judgements but he was not convinced with the explanation of the assessee and confirmed the disallowance after making the following observations I have carefully considered the observations of the <ORG> as well as submissions of the appellant Now the assessee has carried the matter before the <ORG> and reiterated his contentions He further placed reliance upon the orders of the <ORG> in the case of <ORG> Vs Inspecting Assistant Commissioner ITD and Rajeshkumar Vs ITO ITD Having considered the rival submissions and from a careful perusal of the record we find that the impugned liability is admittedly a contractual liability and it can only be claimed on its accrual We therefore do not find any infirmity in the order of the CIT A Aggrieved the assessee has preferred an appeal before the <ORG> with the submission that the entire expenditure should have been allowed because the seminars were conducted for the assessee employees only therefore it cannot be treated as entertainment expenses for the purpose of Section A of the Act On a careful perusal of the break up of the expenses and material available on record we find that the CIT A has already given proper directions to the AO to allow of such expenditure on account of employee participation Since the CIT A has properly adjudicated the impugned issue and we do not find any infirmity therein we use Id his order
