It is in this scenario where there is a lack of quality education and adequate number of schools and colleges that private educational institutions have been established by educationists philanthropists and religious and linguistic minorities The private educational institutions both aided and unaided established by minorities and non minorities in their desire to break free of the unnecessary shackles put on their functioning as modern educational institutions and seeking to impart quality education for the benefit of the community for whom they were established and others have filed the present writ petitions and appeals asserting their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice unhampered by rules and regulations that unnecessarily impinge upon their autonomy On behalf of all these institutions the learned counsels have submitted that the Constitution provides a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions With regard to non minorities the right was stated to be contained in Article and or Article while in the case of linguistic and religious minorities the submission was that this right was enshrined and protected by Article It was further their case that private educational institutions should have full autonomy in their administration It was submitted that the scheme that had been framed in <NAME> case had imposed unreasonable restrictions on the administration of the private educational institutions and that especially in the case of minority institutions the right guaranteed to them under Article stood infringed On behalf of the private minority institutions it was submitted that on the correct interpretation of the various provisions of the Constitution and Articles and in particular the minority institutions have a right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The use of the phrase of their choice in Article clearly postulated that the religious and linguistic minorities could establish and administer any type of educational institution whether it was a school a degree college or a professional college it was argued that such an educational institution is invariably established primarily for the benefit of the religious and linguistic minority and it should be open to such institutions to admit students of their choice In particular it was submitted that Article could not be applied or so interpreted as to completely obliterate the right of the minority institution to grant admission to the students of its own religion or language It was emphasized by the learned counsel that the right to administer an educational institution included the right to constitute a governing body appoint teachers and admit students The learned Solicitor General did not dispute the contention that the right in establish an institution had been confined on the non minorities by Articles and and on the religious and linguistic minorities by Article He agreed with the submission of the counsels for the appellants that the <NAME> decision required reconsideration and that the private unaided educational institutions were entitled to greater autonomy Several States have totally disagreed with the arguments advanced by the learned Solicitor General with regard to the applicability of Article and The State of Andhra Pradesh has not expressly referred to the inter play between Article and Article but has stated that as the minority educational institutions are intended to benefit the minorities a restriction that at least per cent of the students admitted should come from the particular minority which has established the institution should be stipulated as a working rule and that an institution which fulfilled the following conditions should be regarded as minority educational institutions The State of Kerala has submitted again without express reference to Article that the constitutional right of the minorities should be extended to professional education also but while limiting the right of the minorities to admit students belonging to their community to of the total intake of each minority institution We recorded our appreciation for the assistance rendered by him and the other learned counsel We will first consider the arguments of the learned counsels under these heads before dealing with the questions now remaining to be answered Article gives the right to all the citizens to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business this right is subject to restrictions that may be placed under Article Article gives the right to every religious denomination to establish and maintain an institution for religious purposes which would include an educational institution Article and Article therefore confer rights on all citizens and religious denominations to establish and maintain educational institutions There was no serious dispute that the majority community as well as linguistic and religious minorities would have a right under Article and to establish educational institutions In addition Article in no uncertain terms gives the right to the religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice We will first consider the right to establish and administer an educational institution under Article of the Constitution and deal with the right to establish educational institutions under Article and in the next part of the judgment while considering the rights of the minorities Even if there is any doubt about whether education is a profession or not it does appear that education will fall within the meaning of the expression occupation Article uses the four expressions so as to cover all activities of a citizen in respect of which income or profit is generated and which can consequently be regulated under Article There is nothing ambiguous about the word occupation as it is used in the sense of employing one time The fundamental right to establish an educational institution cannot be confused with the right to ask for recognition of affiliation For example the right to carry on a business does not entail the right to carry on a business at a particular place The right to carry on a business may be subject to licensing laws so that a denial of the licence presents a person from carrying on that particular business The question of whether there is a fundamental right or not cannot be dependent upon whether it can be made the subject matter of controls The establishment and running of an educational institution where a large number of persons are employed as teachers or administrative staff and an activity is carried on that results in the imparting of knowledge to the students must necessarily be regarded as an occupation even if there is no element of profit generation The right to establish and maintain educational institutions may also be sourced to Article a which grants in positive terms the right to every religious denomination or any section thereof to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes subject to public order morality and health Therefore religious denominations or sections thereof which do not fall within the special categories carved out in Article and have the right to establish and maintain religious and educational institutions Given this the phrase private educational institution as used in this judgment would include not only those educational institutions set up by the secular persons or bodies but also educational institutions set up by religious denominations the word private is used in contradistinction to government institutions This attack was sustained and it was held that there was a fundamental right to education in every citizen and that the state was duty bound to provide the education and that the private institutions that discharge the state duties were equally bound not to charge a higher fee than the government institutions We will now examine the decision in <NAME> case In this case this <ORG> considered the conditions and regulations if any which the state could impose in the running of private unaided aided recognized or affiliated educational institutions conducting professional courses such a medicine engineering etc The extent to which the fee could be charged by such an institution and the manner in which admissions could be granted was also considered With regard to private aided recognized affiliated educational institutions the <ORG> upheld the power of the government to frame rules and regulations in matter of admission and fees as well as in matters such a recruitment and conditions of service of teachers and staff While we do not wish to express any opinion on the question whether the right to establish an educational institution can be said to be carrying on any occupation within the meaning of Article perhaps it is we are certainly of the opinion that such activity can neither be a trade or business nor can it be a profession within the meaning of Article While holding on an interpretation of Articles and that a citizen who had not completed the age of years had a right to free education it was held that such a right was not available to citizens who were beyond the age of years It was also submitted by the counsel for the minority institutions that <NAME> case was not applicable to the minority institutions but that notwithstanding this the scheme to evolved had been made applicable to them as well Counsel for the institutions as well as the Solicitor General submitted that the decision in <NAME> case insofar as it had framed the scheme relating to the grant of admission and the fixing of the fee was unreasonable and invalid It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the parties that the implementation of the scheme by the States which have amended their rules and regulations has shown a number of anomalies It was contended by petitioned counsel that the implementation of the <NAME> scheme has in fact helped the privileged from richer urban families even after they ceased to be comparatively meritorious and resulted in economic losses for the educational institutions concerned and made them financially unviable Material has also been placed on the record in an effort to show that the total fee realized from the fee fixed for free seats and the payment seats is actually less than the amount of expense that is incurred on each student admitted to the professional college Directions were given to <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> governments to regulate or fix a ceiling on fees and to enforce the same by imposing conditions of affiliation permission to establish and run the institutions The private unaided educational institutions impart education and that cannot be the reason to take away their choice in matters inter alia of selection of students and fixation of fees In practice it has been the case of the marginally less merited rural or poor student bearing the burden of a rich and well exposed urban student the right of a private unaided institution to give admission and to fix the fee Any system of student selection would be unreasonable if it deprives the private unaided institution of the right of rational selection which it devised for itself subject to the minimum qualification that may be prescribed and to some system of computing the equivalence between different kinds of qualifications like a common entrance test Such a system of selection can involve both written and oral tests for selection based on principle of fairness Apart from the decision in <ORG>CITATION> which recognized and upheld the right of a minority aided institution to have a rational admission procedure of its own earlier <ORG> decision of this Court have in effect upheld such a right of an institution devising a rational manner of selecting and admitting students while considering the validity of a viva voce test for admission to a government medical college it was observed at page that colleges run by the government having regard to financial commitments and other relevant considerations would only admit a specific number of students While upholding the order so issued it was observed that once it is conceded and it is not disputed before us that <ORG> can run medical and engineering colleges it cannot be denied the power to admit such qualified students as pass the reasonable tests laid down by it it was observed at page that so far as admission is concerned it has to be made by those who are in control of the Colleges and in this case the <ORG> because the medical colleges are <ORG> colleges affiliated to the University The aforesaid observations clearly underscore the right of the colleges to frame rules for admission and to admit students In view of the discussion hereinabove we hold that the decision in <NAME> case insofar as it framed the scheme relating to the grant of admission and the fixing of the fee was not correct and to that extent the said decision and the consequent direction given to <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> etc Such private educational institutions provide education at three levels viz The right to establish and administer broadly comprises of the following rights a to admit students to set up a reasonable fee structure to constitute a governing body to appoint staff teaching and non teaching and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any employees With regard to the core components of the rights under Article and a it must be held that while the state has the right to prescribe qualifications necessary for admission private unaided colleges have the right to admit students of their choice subject to an objective and rational procedure of selection and the compliance of conditions if any requiring admission of a small percentage of students belonging to weaker sections of the society by granting them freeships or scholarships if not granted by the <ORG> In any event a private institution will have the right to constitute its own governing body for which qualifications may be prescribed by the state or the concerned university Nomination by the state which could be on a political basis will be an inhibiting factor for private enterprise to embark upon the occupation of establishing and administering educational institutions The right to establish an educational institution can be regulated but such regulatory measures must in general be to ensure the maintenance of proper academic standards atmosphere and infrastructure including qualified staff and the prevention of mal administration by those in charge of management The Constitution recognizes the right of the individual or religious denomination or a religious or linguistic minority to establish an educational institution But the essence of a private educational institution is the autonomy that the institution must have in its management and administration While an educational institution is not a business in order to examine the degree of independence that can be given to a recognized educational institution like any private entity that does not seek aid or assistance from the Government and that exists by virtue of the funds generated by it including its loans or borrowings it is important to note that the essential ingredients of the management of the private institution include the recruiting students and staff and the quantum of fee that is to be charged An educational institution is established for the purpose of imparting education of the type made available by the institution More amenities will ensure that better students seek admission to that institution One cannot lose sight of the fact that providing good amenities to the students in the form of competent teaching faculty and other infrastructure costs money One also cannot lose sight of the fact that we live in a competitive world today where professional education is in demand Since the object of setting up an educational institution is by definition charitable it is clear that an educational institution cannot charge such a fee as is not required for the purpose of fulfilling that object While it may not be normally possible to judge the merit of the applicant who seeks admission into a school while seeking admission to a professional institution and to become a competent professional it is necessary that meritorious candidates are not unfairly treated or put at a disadvantage by preferences shown to less meritorious but more influential applicants Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission Appropriate regulations for this purpose may be made keeping in view the other observations made in this judgment in the context of admissions to unaided institutions Merit is usually determined for admission to professional and higher education colleges by either the marks that the student obtains at the qualifying examination or school leaving certificate stage followed by the interview or by a common entrance test conducted by the institution or in the case of professional colleges by government agencies There is no compulsion on students to attend private schools There is a need for private enterprise in non professional college education as well At present insufficient number of undergraduate colleges are being and have been established one of the inhibiting factors being that there is a lack of autonomy due to government regulations An educational institution is established only for the purpose of imparting education to the students Once this principle is kept in mind it must follow that it becomes imperative for the teaching and other staff of an educational institution to perform their duties properly and for the benefit of the students We see no reason why the Management of a private unaided educational should seek the consent or approval of any governmental authority before taking any such action Till a specialized tribunal is set up the right of filing the appeal would lie before the District Judge or Additional District Judge as notified by the government The private educational institutions have a personality of their own and in order to maintain their atmosphere and traditions it is but necessary that they must have the right to choose and select the students who can be admitted to their courses of studies It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided professional institutions It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they do not forgo or discard the principle of merit It would therefore be permissible for the university or the government at the time of granting recognition to require a private unaided institution to provide for merit based selection while at the same time giving the <ORG> sufficient discretion in admitting students This can be done through various methods For instance a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the <ORG> out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by <ORG> and have applied to the college concerned for admission while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the state agency This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the government according to the local needs and different percentage can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided and professional colleges The same principles may be applied to other non professional but unaided educational institutions viz In such professional unaided institutions the Management will have the right to select teachers as per the qualifications and eligibility conditions laid down by <ORG> subject to adoption of a rational procedure of selection A rational fee structure should be adopted by the Management which would not be entitled to charge a capitation fee Appropriate machinery can be devised by the state or university to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering though a reasonable surplus for the furtherance of education is permissible Conditions granting recognition or affiliation can broadly cover academic and educational matters including the welfare of students and teachers It is well established all over the world that those who seek professional education must pay for it The number of seats available in government and government aided colleges is very small compared to the number of persons seeking admission to the medical and engineering colleges All those eligible and deserving candidates who could not be accommodated in government colleges would stand deprived of professional education This void in the field of medical and technical education has been filled by institutions that are established in different places with the aid of donations and the active part taken by public minded individuals The object of establishing an institution has thus been to provide technical or professional education to the deserving candidates and is not necessarily a commercial venture At the school level the recognition or affiliation has to be sought from the educational authority or the body that conducts the school leaving examination It is only on the basis of that examination that a school leaving certificate is granted which enables a student to seek admission in further courses of study after school A college or a professional educational institution has to get recognition from the concerned university which normally requires certain conditions to be fulfilled before recognition It has been held that conditions of affiliation or recognition which pertain to the academic and educational character of the institution and ensure uniformity efficiency and excellence in educational courses are valid and that they do not violate even the provisions of Article of the Constitution but conditions that are laid down for granting recognition should not be such as may lead to governmental control of the administration of the private educational institutions While giving aid to professional institutions it would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe by rules or regulations the conditions on the basis of which admission will be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with the reservation policy of the state The merit may be determined either through a common entrance test conducted by the <ORG> or the <ORG> followed by counseling or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by individual institutions the method to be followed is for the university or the government to decide The authority may also device other means to ensure that admission is granted to an aided professional institution on the basis of merit In the case of such institutions it will be permissible for the government or the university to provide that consideration should be shown to the weaker sections of the society The state which gives aid to an educational institution can impose such conditions as are necessary for the proper maintenance of the high standards of education as the financial burden is shared by the state In many states there are various statutory provisions to regulate the functioning of such educational institutions where the States give as a grant or aid a substantial proportion of the revenue expenditure including salary pay and allowances of teaching and non teaching staff Ever since In Re The Kerala Education Bill SCR this Court has upheld in the case of aided institutions those regulations that served the interests of students and teachers There are a large number of educational institutions like schools and non professional colleges which cannot operate without the support of aid from the state Such rules and regulations can also provide for the reasons and the manner in which a teacher or any other member of the staff can be removed IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A RELIGIOUS OR LINGUISTIC MINORITY IN RELATION TO ARTICLE WHAT IS TO BE THE UNIT THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE We now consider the question of the unit for the purpose of determining the definition of minority within the meaning of Article If therefore the state has to be regarded as the unit for determining linguistic minority vis a vis Article then with religious minority being on the same footing it is the state in relation to which the majority or minority status will have to be determined In the Kerala Education Bill case the question as to whether the minority community was to be determined on the basis of the entire population of India or on the basis of the population of the State forming a part of the Union was posed at page No final opinion on this question was expressed but it was observed at page that as the Kerala Education Bill extends to the whole of the State of Kerala and consequently the minority must be determined by reference to the entire population of that State There can therefore be little doubt that this <ORG> has consistently held that with regard to a state law the unit to determine a religious or linguistic minority can only be the state However Article gives the right to a linguistic or religious minority of a State to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Article give to all persons the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess practice and propagate religion This would mean that the right given to a person under can be curtailed or regulated if the exercise of that right would violate other provisions of Part III of the Constitution or if the exercise thereof is to in consonance with public order morality and health The general law made by the government contains provisions relating to public order morality and health these would have to be complied with and cannot be violated by any person in exercise of his freedom of conscience or his freedom to profess practice and propagate religion Article gives specific power to the state to make any law regulating or restricting any economic financial political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice as provided by Sub clause a of Article This is a further curtailment of the right to profess practice and propagate religion conferred on the persons under Article This Article gives the right to every religious denomination or any section thereof to exercise the rights that it stipulates Clause a of Article gives a religious denomination the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes There is no dispute that the establishment of an educational institution comes within the meaning of the expression charitable purpose Therefore while Article grants the freedom of conscience and the right to profess practice and propagate religion Article can be said to be complementary to it and provides for every religious denomination or any section thereof to exercise the rights mentioned therein Article gives the right to majority religious denominations as well as to minority religious denominations to exercise the rights contained therein In other words if there is a tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination no person an be compelled to pay any such tax While Article and Article relate to institutions that are wholly maintained out of state funds Article deals with an educational institution that is recognized by the state or receives aid out of state funds Article gives the person attending any educational institution the right not to take part in any religious instruction which may be imparted by an institution recognized by the state or receiving aid from the state Such a person also has the right not to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such an institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such a person or if he she is a minor his her guardian has given his her consent We have seen that Article a gives the religious denomination the right to establish an educational institution the religious denomination being either of the majority community or minority community Articles and are a group of articles relating to cultural and educational rights Article gives the right to any section of the citizens residing in India or any part thereof and having a distinct language script or culture of its own to conserve the same For example if in any part of the country there is a section of society that has a distinct language they are entitled to conserve the same even though the persons having that language may profess different religions Article gives the right to all sections of citizens whether they are in a minority or the majority religions to conserve their language script or culture The right to establish and maintain institutions of its choice is a necessary concomitant to the right conferred by Article Article provides that where any educational institution is maintained by the state or receives aid out of state funds no citizen shall be denied admission on the grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The use of the expression any educational institution in Article would refer to any educational institution established by anyone but which is maintained by the state or receives aid out of state funds The right of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions is provided for by Article To some extent Article a and Article overlap insofar as they relate to the establishment of educational institutions but whereas Article gives the right both to the majority as well as minority communities to establish and maintain institutions for charitable purposes which would inter alia include educational institutions Article refers to the right of minorities to establish and maintain educational institutions of their choice Another difference between Article and Article is that whereas Article refers only to religious denominations Article contains the right of religious as well as linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Article bestows on the minorities whether based on religion or language the right to establish and administer educational institution of their choice This Sub Article also does not specifically mention that the right to establish and administer a minority educational institution would be subject to any rules or regulations Can Article be so read as to mean that it contains an absolute right of the minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions in any manner they desire and without being obliged to comply with the provisions of any law Des Article give the religious or linguistic minorities a right to establish an educational institution that propagates religious or racial bigotry or ill will amongst the people Can the right under Article be so exercised that it is opposed to public morality or health In the exercise of its right would the minority while establishing educational institutions not be bound by town planning rules and regulations Can they construct and maintain buildings in any manner they desire without complying with the provisions of the building by laws or health regulations While considering the validity of this order this Court interpreted Article and held that if admission was refused only on the grounds of religion race caste language or any of them then there was a clear breach of the fundamental right under Article In deciding this question the <ORG> analyzed the provisions of Articles and and repelled the contention that Article guaranteed the right only to the citizens of the minority group It was observed in this connection at page as follows Article confers a special right on citizens for admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the <ORG> To limit this right only to citizens belonging to minority groups will be to provide a double protection for such citizens and to hold that the citizens of the majority group have no special educational rights in the nature of a right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of which they make contributions by way of taxes We see no cogent reason for such discrimination It is clear from the aforesaid discussion that this Court came to the conclusion that in the case of minority educational institutions to which protection was available under Article the provisions of Article were indeed applicable But it may be seen that the question in the present from i whether in the matter of admissions into aided minority educational institutions minority students could be preferred to a reasonable extent keeping in view the special protection given under Article did not arise for consideration in that case In the Kerala Education Bill case this Court again had the occasion to consider the interplay of Articles and of the Constitution This case was a reference under Article of the Constitution made by the President of India to obtain the opinion of this Court on certain questions relating to the constitutional validity of some of the provisions of the kerala Education Bill which had been passed by <ORG> but had been reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the President With reference to Article the <ORG> observed at page while dealing with an argument based on Article that likewise Article provides inter alia that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution receiving did out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Under Article all persons are equally entitled subject to public order morality and health and to the other provisions of Part III to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion Article confers the fundamental right to every religious denomination or any section thereof subject to public order morality and health to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes to manage its own affairs in matters of religion to acquire property and to administer such property in accordance with law Article confers on any section of the citizens having a distinct language script or culture of its own to have the right of conserving the same Clause of that Article provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Dealing with Articles and at page it was observed as follows Articles and are set out in Part III of our Constitution which guarantees our fundamental rights It is obvious that a minority community can effectively conserve its language script or culture by and through educational institutions and therefore the right to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice is a necessary concomitant to the right to conserve its distinctive language script or culture and that is what is conferred on all minorities by Article which has hereinbefore been quoted in full This right however is subject to Clause or Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them It had been inter alia contended on behalf of the state that if a single member of any other community is admitted in a school establish for a particular minority community then the education institution would cease to be an educational institution established by that particular minority community It was contended that because of Article when an educational institution established by a minority community gets aid it would be precluded from denying admission to members of other communities because of Article and that as a consequence thereof it would cease to be an educational institution of the choice of the minority community that established it Repelling this argument it was observed at pages as follows There is no such limitation in Article and to accept this limitation will necessarily involve the addition of the words for their own community in the Article which is ordinarily not permissible according to well established rules of interpretation To say that an institution which receives aid on account of its being minority educational institution must not refuse to admit any member of any other community only on the grounds therein mentioned and then to say that as soon as such institution admit such an outsider it will cease to be a minority institution is tentamount to saying that minority institutions will not as minority institutions be entitled to any aid It will be seen that the use of the expression sprinkling of outsiders in that case clearly implied the applicability of Article to Article the <ORG> held that when a minority educational institution received aid outsiders would have to be admitted The <ORG> concluded at page as follows We have already observed that Article gives two rights to the minorities to establish and to administer educational institutions of their choice The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to maladminister The minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings without any competent teachers possessing any semblance of qualification and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars It stands to reason then that the constitutional right to administer an educational institution of their choice does not necessarily militate against the claim of the <ORG> to insist that in order to grant aid the <ORG> may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to be aided While noting that Article referred not only to religious minorities but also to linguistic minorities it was held that the Article gave those minorities the right to establish educational institutions of their choice and that no limitation could be placed on the subjects to be taught at such educational institutions and that general secular education is also comprehended within the scope of Article The opinion expressed therein does not really go counter to the ultimate view taken by us in regard to the inter play of Articles and The said primary schools and college were conducted for the benefit of the religious denomination of <ORG> and <ORG> generally though admission was not denied to students belonging to other communities The petitioners challenged the government order requiring of the seats to be filled by nominees of the government inter alia on the ground that the petitioners were members of a religious denomination and that they constituted a religious minority and that the educational institutions had been established primarily for the benefit of the Christian community It was the case of the petitioners that the decision of the <ORG> violated their fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles a and and and While interpreting Article it was observed by this <ORG> at pages as under All minorities linguistic or religious have by Article an absolute right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and any law or executive direction which seeks to infringe the substance of that right under Article would to that extent to void While coming to the conclusion that the right of the private training colleges to admit students of their choice was severely restricted this Court referred to the opinion in the <ORG> case but distinguished it by observing that the Court did not in that case lay down any test of reasonableness of the regulation No general principle on which the reasonableness of a regulation may be tested was sought to be laid down in the <ORG> case and therefore it was held in <NAME> case that the opinion in that case was not an authority for the proposition that all regulative measures which were not destructive or annihilative of the character of the institution established by the minority provided the regulations were in the national or public interests were valid In this connection it was further held at page as follows The right established by Article is a fundamental right declared in terms absolute Unlike the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Article it is not subject to reasonable restrictions If every order which while maintaining the formal character of a minority institution destroys the power of administration is held justifiable because it is in the public or national interests though not in its interest as an educational institution the right guaranteed by Article will be but a teasing illusion a promise of unreality Regulations which may lawfully be imposed either by legislative or executive action as a condition of receiving grant or of recognition must be directed to making the institution while retaining its character as a minority institution effective as an educational institution Such regulation must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it Any regulation framed in the national interest must necessarily apply to all educational institutions whether run by the majority or the minority Such a limitation must necessarily be read into Article It is of course true that government regulations cannot destroy the minority character of the institution or make the right to establish and administer a mere illusion but the right under Article is not so absolute as to be above the law but the said case has no application here In that case it was contended on behalf of the State of Bihar that as the protection to the minority under Article was only a right to conserve a distinct language script or culture of its own the college did not qualify for the protection of Article because it was not founded to conserve them and that consequently it was open to all sections of the people Dealing with Article it was observed at pages as follows Article has been construed before by this Court The first right is the initial right to establish institutions of the minority choice It matters not if a single philanthropic individual with his own means founds the institution or the community at large contributes the funds It is equally irrelevant that in addition to the minority community others from other minority communities or even from the majority community can take advantage of these institutions Such other communities bring in income and they do not have to be turned away to enjoy the protection These and some other provisions were challenged on the ground that they were violative of Article In this connection at page it was observed as follows It will be observed that Article is wider than Article in that while any Section of the citizens including the minorities can invoke the rights guaranteed under Article the rights guaranteed under Article are only available to the minorities based on religion or language A reading of these two Articles together would lead us to conclude that a religious or linguistic minority has a right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice for effectively conserving its distinctive language script or culture which right however is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and facilitating the excellence of its standards This right is further subject to Clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution which is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them One of the questions that arose in this case was as to whether the petitioner was a minority institution Father <NAME> this Court held that there was no justification for the provisions contained in Clause a and Clause of the statutes as the interfered with the rights of management of the minority educational institutions <NAME> observed that these provisions cannot therefore be made as conditions of affiliation the non compliance of which would involved disaffiliation and consequently they will have to be struck down as offending Article Clause however was held not to suffer from the same vice as Clause because the provision insofar as it was applicable to the minority institutions empowered the <ORG> to prescribe by regulations governing the service and conduct of teachers and that this was in the larger interest of the institutions and in order to ensure their efficiency and excellence In this connection it was observed at page that Uniformity in the conditions of service and conduct of teachers in all <ORG> would make for harmony and avoid frustration Of course while the power to make ordinances in respect of the matters referred to is unexceptional the nature of the infringement of the right if any under Article will depend on the actual purpose and import of the ordinance when made and the manner in which it is likely to affect the administration of the educational institution about which it is not possible now to predicate this Court had to consider the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Gujarat <ORG> Act insofar as they were made to apply to the minority Christian institution The Court considered the scope and ambit of the rights of the minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under Article of the Constitution In dealing with this aspect <NAME> <NAME> at page while considering Article to observed as follows Every section of the public the majority as well as minority has rights in respect of religion as contemplated in Articles and and rights in respect of language script culture as contemplated in Article If religious or linguistic minorities are not given protection under Article to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice they will feel isolated and separate The Court then considered whether the religious and linguistic minorities who have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice had a fundamental right to affiliation While considering the right of the religious and linguistic minorities to administer their educational institutions it was observed by <NAME> at page as follows In other words the minority institutions want to have the right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations about academic qualifications While considering this right to administer it was held that the same was not an absolute right and that the right was not free from regulation The minority institutions have the right to administer institutions The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is that it does not rest on or proclaim its minority character The right of a minority to administer its educational institution involves as part of it a correlative duty of good administration In a concurrent judgment while noting that Clause of Article forbids the denial of admission to citizens into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of then <NAME> <NAME> then examined Article and observed at page as follows Clause of Article gives right to all minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Analyzing that clause it would follow that the right which has been conferred by the clause is no two types of minorities Those minorities may be based either on religion or on language The word establish indicates the rights to bring into existence while the right to administer an institution means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of the institution The words of their choice qualify the educational institutions and show that the educational institutions established and administered by the minorities need not be of some particular class the minorities have the right and freedom to establish and administer such educational institutions as they choose Clause of Article prevents the <ORG> from making discrimination in the matter of grant of aid to any educational institution on the ground that the institution is under the management of a minority whether based on religion or language Explaining the rationale behind Article it was observed at page as follows The idea of giving some special rights to the minorities is not to have a kind of a privileged or pampered section of the population but to give to the minorities a sense of security and a feeling of confidence the Constitution and the laws made by civilized nations therefore generally contain provisions for the protection of those interests The learned Judge then observed that the right of the minorities to administer educational institutions did not prevent the making of reasonable regulations in respect of these institutions Recognizing that the right to administer educational institutions could not include the right to mal administer it was held that regulations could be lawfully imposed for the receiving of grants and recognition while permitting the institution to retain its character as a minority institution The regulation must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conductive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it But it was also stated that the regulations made by the authority should not impinge upon the minority character of the institution Therefore a balance has to be kept between the two objectives that of ensuring the standard of excellence of the institution and that of preserving the right of the minorities to establish and administer their educational institutions While it was permissible for the state and its educational authorities to prescribe the qualifications of teachers it was held that once the teachers possessing the requisite qualifications were selected by the minorities for their educational institutions the state would have no right to veto the selection of those teachers The <ORG> attention was drawn to the fact that in the <ORG> case this <ORG> has opined that Clauses and made it obligatory for all aided schools to select teachers from a panel selected from each district by <ORG> and that no teacher of an aided school could be dismissed removed or reduced in rank without the previous sanction of the authorized officer It is the law declared by this <ORG> in the subsequent contested cases which would have a binding effect It was held that the power of the Vice Chancellor while hearing an appeal against the imposition of the panel was uncanalized and unguided SCR a law which sought to regulate the working of minority institutions by providing that a broad based management committee could be re constituted by including therein the Principal and the senior most teacher was valid and not violative of the right under Article of the Constitution It was held by this Court that the regulations regarding pay and allowances for teachers and staff would not violate Article In the <ORG> case the right of minorities to administer educational institutions and the applicability of Article to an institution to which Article was applicable came up for consideration The applications were processed and a cut off percentage for each subject was determined by the Head of the respective Departments and a list of potentially suitable candidates was prepared on the basis of and ratios for Arts and Science students respectively and they were then called for an interview i for every available seat in the Arts Department four candidates were called for interviews similarly for every available seat in <ORG> five candidates were called for interviews The <ORG> however had issued a circular which provided that admission should be granted to the various courses purely on the basis of merit i the percentage of marks secured by the students in the qualifying examination It was contended by the petitioners that the <ORG> was bound to follow the <ORG> policy rules and regulations regarding admission and further argued that it was not a minority institution and in the alternative it was not entitled to discriminate against students on the ground of religion as the college was receiving grant in aid from the government and that such discrimination was violative of Article The <ORG> had also filed a writ petition in <ORG> taking the stand that it was a religious minority institution and that the circular of the <ORG> regarding admission violated its fundamental right under Article The <ORG> challenged the <ORG> circular on the ground that it was not regulatory in nature and that it violated its right under Article This <ORG> referred to the earlier decisions and with regard to Article observed at page paragraph as follows The minorities whether based on religion or language have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The <ORG> therefore has the right to regulate the standard of education and allied matters The right to minorities whether religious or linguistic to administer educational institutions and the power of the <ORG> to regulate academic matters and management is now fairly well settled The right to administer does not include the right to maladminister The <ORG> being the controlling authority has right and duty to regulate all academic matters Regulations however shall not have the effect of depriving the right of minorities to educate their children in their own institution That is a privilege which is implied in the right conferred by Article Bearing this principle in mind this <ORG> took note of the fact that if the <ORG> was to admit students as per the circular issued by the <ORG> it would have to deny admissions to the students belonging to the Christian community because of the prevailing situation that even after the concession only a small number of minority applicants would gain admission This <ORG> then dealt with the question as to whether a preference in favour of or a reservation of seats for candidates belonging to its own community by the minority institutions would be invalid under Article of the Constitution On behalf of the institutions it was argued that a preference given to minority candidates in their own educational institutions on the ground that those candidates belonged to that minority community was not violative of Article and that in the exercise of Article the minorities were entitled to establish and administer educational institutions for the exclusive advantage of their own community candidates Firstly it was held that institutional preference to minority candidates based on religion was apparently an institutional discrimination on the forbidden ground of religion the <ORG> stated that if an educational institution says yes to one candidate but says no to other candidate on the ground of religion it amounts to discrimination on the ground of religion For if such was the aim Article would have been differently worded and it would have contained the words for their own community the fact that Article applied to minorities as well as non minorities did not mean that it was intended to nullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in Article Article deals with non discrimination and is available only to individuals There is no similar provision for other minorities to get grant from the <ORG> It was further held that the state could lay down reasonable conditions for obtaining grant in aid and for its proper utilization but that the state had no power to compel minority institutions to give up their rights under Article After referring to the Kerala Education Bill case and <NAME> case the Court observed at page paragraph as follows In the latter case this court observed at SCR pages that the regulation which may lawfully be imposed as a condition of receiving grant must be directed in making the institution an effective minority educational institution Such regulations must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution After referring to the following observations in <ORG> case The right of a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice under Article is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and sic ng the excellence of its standards This right is further subject to Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution which is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them the learned Judges remarked at page para that in the said case the <ORG> was not deciding the question that had arisen before them According to the learned Judges the question of the interplay of Article with Article had arisen in that case St There is need to strike a balance between the two competing rights The two competing rights are the right of the citizen not to be denied admission granted under Article and right of the religious or linguistic minority to administer and establish an institution of its choice granted under Article We agree with the contention of the learned Solicitor General that the Constitution in Part III does not contain or give any absolute right All rights conferred in Part III of the Constitution are subject to at least other provisions of the said Part It is difficult to comprehend that the framers of the Constitution would have given such an absolute right to the religious or linguistic minority which would enable them to establish and administer educational institutions in manner so as to be in conflict with the other Parts of the Constitution Decisions of this Court have held that the right to administer does not include the right to mal administer General laws of the land applicable to all persons have been held to be applicable to the minority institutions also for example laws relating to taxation sanitation social welfare economic regulation public order and morality By the same analogy there is no reason why regulations or conditions concerning generally the welfare of students and teachers should not be made applicable in order to provide a proper academic atmosphere as such provisions do not in any way interfere with the right of administration or management under Article As we look at it Article is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice It was observed in <ORG> case at page that the whole object of conferring the right on minorities under Article is to ensure that there will be equality between the majority and the minority They will have to comply with the conditions of recognition which cannot be such as to whittle down the right under Article We have now to address the question of whether Article gives a right to ask for a grant or aid from the state and secondly if it does get aid to examine to what extent its autonomy in administration specifically in the matter of admission to the educational institution established by the community can be curtailed or regulated Article only gives the right to assistance by way of grant to the Anglo Indian community for a specified period of time This means that the right under Article implies that any grant that is given by the state to the minority institution cannot have such conditions attached to it which will in any way dilute or abridge the rights of the minority institution to establish and administer that institution The conditions that can normally be permitted to be imposed on the educational institutions receiving the grant must be related to the proper utilization of the grant and fulfillment of the objectives of the grant Such conditions would be valid if they are also imposed on other educational institutions receiving the grant Whether it is an institution run by the majority or the minority all conditions that have relevance to the proper utilization of the grant in aid by an educational institution can be imposed Article is the right of a person studying in a state recognized institution or in an educational institution receiving aid from state funds not to take part in any religious instruction if imparted by such institution without his her consent or his her guardian consent if such a person is a minor Just as Article and become applicable the moment any educational institution takes aid likewise Article would also be attracted and become applicable to an educational institution maintained by the state or receiving aid out of state funds If Article and apply to a minority institution that receives aid out of state funds there is nothing in the language of Article that would make the provisions of Article inapplicable Like Article and Article Article refers to any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds it is true that one of the rights to administer an educational institution is to grant admission to the students Out of the various rights that the minority institution has in the administration of the institution Article curtails the right to grant admission to a certain extent By virtue of Article no citizen can be denied admission by an aided minority institution on the grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them A minority educational institution has a right to impart religious instruction this right is taken away by Article if that minority institution is maintained wholly out of state funds If the curtailment of the right to administer a minority institution on receiving aid or being wholly maintained out of state funds as provided by Article is valid there is no reason why Article should not be held to be applicable There is nothing in the language of Article and Article and Article to suggest that on receiving aid Article and will apply but Article will not Therefore the contention that the institutions covered by Article are outside the injunction of Article cannot be accepted As was observed in the <NAME> case the right given by Article is fortified by Article insofar as minorities are concerned In the <ORG> case it was held that the right to establish an educational institution is not confined to conservation of language script or culture When constitutional provisions are interpreted it has to be borne in mind that the interpretation should be such as to further the object of their incorporation Although the right to administer includes within it a right to grant admission to students of their choice under Article when such a minority institution is granted the facility of receiving grant in aid Article would apply and necessarily therefore one of the right of administration of the minorities would be eroded to some extent While therefore a minority educational institution receiving grant in aid would not be completely outside the discipline of Article of the Constitution by no stretch of imagination can the rights guaranteed under Article be annihilated As observed quite aptly in <ORG> case the fact that Article applies to minorities as well as non minorities does not mean that it was intended to nullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in Article The word only used in Article is of considerable significance and has been used for some avowed purpose The best possible way is to hold that as long as the minority educational institution permits admission of citizens belonging to the non minority class to a reasonable extent based upon merit it will not be an infraction of Article even though the institution admits students of the minority group of its own choice for whom the institution was meant However even if it is possible to fill up all the seats with students of the minority group the moment the institution is granted aid the institution will have to admit students of the non minority group to a reasonable extent whereby the character of the institution is not annihilated and at the same time the rights of the citizen engrafted under Article are not subverted SCC at page paragraph as follows Before we proceed to deal with the question we may be permitted to make a few observations The questions arising herein are not only of great moment and consequence they are also extremely delicate and sensitive Though we are sitting in a larger Bench we have kept in mind the relevance and significance of the principle of stare decisis Where a decision has stood the test of time and has never been doubted we have respected it unless of course there are compelling and strong reasons to depart from it The right of the aided minority institution to preferably admit students of its community when Article was applicable has been clarified by this Court over a decade ago in the <ORG> case Though we accept the ratio of <ORG> which has held the field for over a decade we have compelling reservations in accepting the rigid percentage stipulated therein As the regulations to promote academic excellence and standards do not encroach upon the guaranteed rights under Article the aided minority educational institutions can be required to observe inter se merit amongst the eligible minority applicants and passage of common entrance test by the candidates where there is one with regard to admissions in professional and non professional colleges If there is no such test a rational method of assessing comparative merit has to be evolved The aided linguistic minority educational institution is given the right to admit students belonging to the linguistic minority to a reasonable extent only to ensure that its minority character is preserved and that the objective of establishing the institution is not defeated If so such an institution is under an obligation to admit the bulk of the students fitting into the description of the minority community Therefore the students of that group residing in the state in which the institution is located have to be necessarily admitted in a large measure because they constitute the linguistic minority group as far as that state is concerned The management bodies of such institution cannot resort to the device of admitting the linguistic students of the adjoining state in which they are in a majority under the facade of the protection given under Article If not the very objective of conferring the preferential right of admission by harmoniously constructing Articles and which we have done above may be distorted It is no doubt true that the <ORG> has the power and the function to see that no one including the government acts contrary to the law but the cardinal principle of our jurisprudence is that it is for the person who alleges that the law has been violated to prove it to be so The Constitution recognizes the differences among the people of India but it gives equal importance to each of them their differences notwithstanding for only then can there be a unified secular nation Recognizing the need for the preservation and retention of different pieces that go into the making of a whole nation the Constitution while maintaining inter alia the basic principle of equality contains adequate provisions that ensure the preservation of these different pieces ANSWERS TO ELEVEN QUESTIONS What is the meaning and content of the expression minorities in Article of the Constitution of India A Linguistic and religious minorities are covered by the expression minority under Article of the Constitution Since reorganisation of the <ORG> in India has been on linguistic lines therefore for the purpose of determining the minority the unit will be the <ORG> and note the whole of India Thus religious and linguistic minorities who have been put at par in Article have to be considered <ORG> wise What is meant by the expression religion in Article Can the followers of a sect or denomination of a particular religion claim protection under Article on the basis that they constitute a minority in the State even though the followers of that religion are in majority in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench a What are the indicia for treating an educational institution as a minority educational institution Would an institution be regarded as a minority educational institution because it was established by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority or its being administered by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench To what extent can professional education be treated as a matter coming under minorities rights under Article A Article gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The use of the words of their choice indicates that even professional educational institutions would be covered by Article Whether the admission of students to minority educational institution whether aided or unaided can be regulated by <ORG> or by the <ORG> to which the institution is affiliated A Admission of students to unaided minority educational institutions viz schools and undergraduates colleges where the scope for merit based selection is practically nil cannot be regulated by the concerned <ORG> or <ORG> except for providing the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards The right to admit students being an essential facet of the right to administer educational institutions of their choice as contemplated under Article of the Constitution the state government or the university may not be entitled to interfere with that right so long as the admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a transparent basis and the merit is adequately taken care of The right to administer not being absolute there could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof and it is more so in the matter of admissions to professional institutions A minority institution does not cease to be so the moment grant in aid is received by the institution An aided minority educational institution therefore would be entitled to have the right of admission of students belonging to the minority group and at the same time would be required to admit a reasonable extent of non minority students so that the rights under Article are not substantially impaired and further the citizens rights under Article are not infringed What would be a reasonable extent would vary from the types of institution the courses of education for which admission is being sought and other factors like educational needs Observance of inter se merit amongst the applicants belonging to the minority group could be ensured As regards non minority students who are eligible to seek admission for the remaining seats admission should normally be on the basis of the common entrance test held by the state agency followed by counselling wherever it exists a Whether the minority rights to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice will include the procedure and method of admission and selection of students A A minority institution may have its own procedure and method of admission as well as selection of students but such a procedure must be fair and transparent and the selection of students in professional and higher education colleges should be on the basis of merit Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission while exercising its right to admit students to the colleges aforesaid as in that event the institution will fail to achieve excellence Whether the minority institutions right of admission of students and to lay down procedure and method of admission if any would be affected in any way by the receipt of State aid A While giving aid to professional institutions it would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe by rules or regulations the conditions on the basis of which admission will be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with the reservation policy of the state qua non minority students The merit may be determined either through a common entrance test conducted by the concerned <ORG> or the <ORG> followed by counselling or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by individual institutions the method to be followed is for the university or the government to decide The authority may also devise other means to ensure that admission is granted to an aided professional institution on the basis of merit In the case of such institutions it will be permissible for the government or the university to provide that consideration should be shown to the weaker sections of the society Whether the statutory provisions which regulate the facets of administration like control over educational agencies control over governing bodies conditions of affiliation including recognition withdrawal thereof and appointment of staff employees teachers and Principal including their service conditions and regulation of fees etc would interfere with the right of administration of minorities A So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets of administration are concerned in case of an unaided minority educational institution the regulatory measure of control should be minimal and the conditions of recognition as well as the conditions of affiliation to an university or board have to be complied with but in the mater of day to day management like the appointment of staff teaching and non teaching and administrative control over them the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency However a rational procedure for the selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the management itself For redressing the grievances of employees of aided and unaided institutions who are subjected to punishment or termination from service a mechanism will have to be evolved and in our opinion appropriate tribunals could be constituted and till then such tribunals could be presided over by a Judicial Officer of the rank of District Judge The <ORG> or other controlling authorities however can always prescribe the minimum qualification experience and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for being appointed as a teacher or a principal of any educational institution Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the state without interfering with the overall administrative control of the management over the staff Fees to be charged by unaided institutions cannot be regulated but no institution should charge capitation fee a Where can a minority institution be operationally located Where a religious or linguistic minority in State A establishes an educational institution in the said State can such educational institution grant preferential admission reservations and other benefits to members of the religious linguistic group from other States where they are non minorities A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench Whether it would be correct to say that only the members of that minority residing in State A will be treated as the members of the minority vis vis such institution A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench Whether the member of a linguistic non minority in one State can establish a trust society in another State and claim minority status in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench It has to be left to authorities to prescribe a reasonable percentage having regard to the type of institution population and educational needs of minorities except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right and the scheme framed thereunder required reconsideration modification and if yes what A The scheme framed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case case and the directio to impose the same except where it holds that primary education is fundamental right is unconstitutional Reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not however amount to profiteering Whether the non minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institution under Article and read with Articles and in the same manner and to the same extent as minority institutions And What is the meaning of the expressions Education and Educational Institutions in various provisions of the Constitution Is the right to establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under the Constitution A The expression education in the Articles of the Constitution means and includes education at all levels from the primary school level upto the post graduate level It includes professional education The expression educational institutions means institutions that impart education where education is as understood hereinabove The right to establish and administer educational institutions is guaranteed under the Constitution to all citizens under Articles and to minorities specifically under Article All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles and but this right is subject to the provisions of Articles and a However minority institutions will have a right to admit students belonging to the minority group in the manner as discussed in this judgment I have no doubt members of my profession will be very glad to throw considerable light on what is and is not a justiciable right of this nature A Member For a fee At this stage it may be noted that the expression minorities has been used in Article in two senses one based on religion and other on basis of language When India attained freedom the framers of the Constitution threw away the idea of having separate electorates based on religion and decided to have a system of joint electorates so that every candidate in an election would have to seek support of all sections of the constituency But the question arises what is the test to determine minority status based on religion or language of a group of persons residing in a State or Union Territory The said draft Article VI runs as under Citizens belonging to national minorities in a State whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other citizens in forming controlling and administering at their own expense charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establishments with the free use of their language and practice of their religions The Article intends to give protection in the matter of culture language and script not only to a minority technically but also to a minority in the wider sense of the term as I have explained just now Thus the intention of the framers of the Constitution and subsequent amendments in the Constitution indicate that protection was conferred not only to religious minorities but also to linguistic minorities on basis of their number in a State unit where they intend to establish an institution of their choice The question who are minorities arose for the first time in the case of Kerala Education Bill case SCR at The contention of the petitioners is that they have an exclusive right to administer the institution under Article of the Constitution and that the order of the Director of Public Instruction constitutes violation of that right Clause of Article provides that all minorities whether based on religion of language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and clause that the <ORG> shall not in granting aid to educational institutions discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority whether based on religion or language The word minority is not defined in the Constitution and in the absence of any special definition we must hold that any community religious or linguistic which is numerically less than fifty per cent of the population of the <ORG> is entitled to the fundamental right guaranteed by the article In the said report views of <ORG> which was based on decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> was referred to which runs as under In India <ORG> after observing that the Constitution granted specific rights to minorities declared that in the absence of any special definition we must hold that any community religious or linguistic which is numerically less than of the population of the State is entitled to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution While dealing with the said argument this Court held as follow Though there was a faint attempt to canvas the position that religious or linguistic minorities should be minorities in relation to the entire population of the country in our view they are to be determined only in relation to the particular legislation which is sought to be impugned namely that if it is the State legislature these minorities have to be determined in relation to the population of the State However curiously enough there is no discussion that if the particular legislation sought to be impugned is a central legislation minority status has to be tested in relation to the population of the whole of the country In the absence of any such discussion it cannot be inferred that if there is a central legislation the minority status of a group of persons has to be determined in relation to the entire population of the country On when these matters came up before a Bench of seven Judges of this court the Bench passed an order which runs as under In view of the nd Amendment to the Constitution placing with effect from the subject Education in Entry List III of the th Schedule to the Constitution and the quoted decisions of the Larger Benches of this Court being of the pre amendment era the answer to the brooding question as to who in the context constitutes a minority has become one of the utmost significance and therefore it is appropriate that these matters are placed before a Bench of at least Hon ble Judges for determining the questions involved In view of the referring order the question that arises for consideration is whether the transposition of the subject Education from List II to List III has brought change to the test determining who are minorities for the purposes of Article of the Constitution The power to legislate is given to the appropriate legislature by Article and other articles Article provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the legislature of a <ORG> may make laws for whole or any part of the <ORG> Under Article <ORG> has exclusive power to make law with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule From the aforesaid provisions it is clear that it is Article and other Articles which either empower <ORG> or <ORG> to enact law and not the Entries finding place in three Lists of Seventh Schedule Thus the function of entries in three lists of the Seventh Schedule is to demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislatures can enact laws but do not confer power either on <ORG> or <ORG>s to enact laws In this view of the matter by transfer of contents of entry of List II to List III as entry has not denuded the power of <ORG> to enact law on the subject Education but has also conferred power on <ORG> to enact law on the subject Education Article confers fundamental right to linguistic and religious minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice If we give different meaning to the expression minority occurring in Article in relation to a central legislation the very purpose for which protection has been given to minority would disappear Under Article linguistic or religious minorities fundamental rights to establish and administer educational institution of their choice have been protected It is urged on behalf of the minority institutions that Article confers an absolute right on linguistic or religious minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice According to them Article does not confer an absolute right on the institutions set up by the linguistic or religious minorities receiving government aid and such institutions cannot extend preference to the members of their own community in the matter of admission of students in the institutions Learned counsel for the parties has pressed into service various rules of constructions for interpreting Article and Article in their own way After the Constitution of India came into force Articles and came up for interpretation before various <ORG> and <ORG> There appears to be no unanimity amongst the judicial decisions rendered by the courts as regards the extent of right conferred by Article The second line of decisions is that minority institutions receiving government aid while admitting students from their own communities in the institutions established by them are free to admit students from other communities belonging to majority and such admission of students in the institution do not destroy the minority character of the institution The third line of decisions is that under Article fundamental right declared in terms is absolute although it was not decided whether Article is subject to Article or not However the view in the said decisions is that the right conferred under Article is an absolute right On appeal to <ORG> this Court held thus Article gives protection to any section of the citizens having a distinct language script or culture by guaranteeing their right to conserve the same Article secures to all minorities whether based on religion or language the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Nor do we see any reason to limit article to citizens belonging to a minority group other than the section or the minorities referred to in article or article for the citizens who do not belong to any minority group may quite conceivably need this protection just as much as the citizens of such other minority groups If it is urged that the citizens of the majority group are amply protected by article and do not require the protection of article then there are several obvious answers to that argument Article confers a special right on citizens for admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the <ORG> To limit this right only to citizens belonging to minority groups will be to provide a double protection for such citizens and to hold that the citizens of the majority group have no special educational rights in the nature of a right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of which they make contributions by way of taxes We see no cogent reason for such discrimination It is obvious that a minority community can effectively conserve its language script or culture by and through educational institutions and therefore the right to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice is a necessary concomitant to the right to conserve its distinctive language script or culture and that is what is conferred on all minorities by Article which has hereinbefore been quoted in full This right however is subject to clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them After holding that Article is subject to clause of Article this Court further held thus There is no such limitation in Article and to accept this limitation will necessarily involve the addition of the words for their own community in the Article which is ordinarily not permissible according to well established rules of interpretation To say that an institution which receives aid on account of its being a minority educational institution must not refuse to admit any member of any other community only on the grounds therein mentioned and then to say that as soon as such institution admits such an outsider it will cease to be a minority institution is tantamount to saying that minority institutions will not as minority institutions be entitled to any aid it was held thus A reading of these two Articles together would lead us to conclude that a religious or linguistic minority has a right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice for effectively conserving its distinctive language script or culture which right however is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and facilitating the excellence of its standards This right is further subject to clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution which is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of <ORG> funds From the decisions referred to above the principles that emerge are these Article confers right on the citizens for admission into educational institution maintained or aided by the <ORG> without discrimination To limit this right only to citizens belonging to minority group will be to provide double protection for such citizens and to hold that citizens of the majority group have no special educational rights in the nature of a right to be admitted into an educational institution for maintenance of which they make contribution by way of taxes There is no reason for such discrimination Article is subject to Article and the real import of Articles and is that they clearly contemplate minority institutions with the sprinkling of the outsiders admitted into it and by admitting the non minority into it the minority institutions do not shed its character and cease to be minority institutions SCR it was held that it is permissible that a minority institution while admitting students from its community may also admit students from majority community although the question as to whether Article is subject to Article was not considered yet it was held that under Article fundamental right declared in terms absolute It was also held that unlike fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article it is not subject to reasonable restrictions However it may be noted that this case was in relation to an institution referred to in Article but has been cited for the purpose that there cannot be communal reservation in the educational institution receiving aid out of <ORG> funds From the aforesaid four categories of decisions it appears that there is not a single decision of this <ORG> where it has been held that Article is not subject to Article Since this Bench is of eleven Judges and decisions of this <ORG> holding that Article is subject to Article are by lesser number of Judges I shall examine the question independently Citizens belonging to national minorities in a State whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other citizens in forming controlling and administering at their own expense charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establishment with the free use of their language and practice of their religion It shall be the duty of every unit to provide in the public educational system in towns and districts in which a considerable proportion of citizens of other than the language of the unit are residents adequate facilities for ensuring that in the primary schools the instruction shall be given to the children of such citizens through the medium of their own language The recommendations of the said <ORG><ORG>Committee were these i All citizens are entitled to use their mother tongue and the scrip thereof and to adopt study or use any other language and script of their choice ii Minorities in every unit shall be adequately protected in respect of their language and culture and no government may enact any laws or regulations that may act oppressively or prejudicially in this respect iii No minority whether of religion community or language shall be deprived of its rights or discriminated against in regard to the admission into State educational institutions nor shall any religious instruction be compulsorily imposed on them iv All minorities whether of religion community or language shall be free in any unit to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and they shall be entitled to <ORG> aid in the same manner and measure as is given to similar <ORG> aided institutions Notwithstanding any custom law decree or usage presumption or terms of dedication no Hindu on grounds of caste birth or denomination shall be precluded from entering in educational institutions dedicated or intended for the use of the Hindu community or any section thereof vi No disqualification shall arise on account of sex in respect of public serve or professions or admission to educational institutions save and except that this shall not prevent the establishment of separate educational institutions for boys and girls <ORG> inter alia recommended that Clause which corresponds to Article of the Constitution should be re drafted as follows All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion subject order morality or health and to the other provisions of this chapter When Clause was moved by <NAME> for adoption by the <ORG> several members were of the view that Clause may be referred back to <ORG> for reconsideration in the light of discussion that took place on that day While we welcome such donations when a principle has been laid down that if any institution receives <ORG> aid it cannot discriminate or refuse admission to members of other communities then it should be follow If he had explained it probably the <ORG> would have been convinced No minority whether based on religion community or language shall be discriminated against in regard to the admission of any person belonging to such minority into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> a All minorities whether based on religion community or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice He stated thus I want that all citizens should have the right to enter any public educational institution According to him for amendment No of the List of amendment the following be substituted No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them He further stated thus Sir I find there are three points of difference between this amendment and the provisions of the section which it seeks to amend Unfortunately there is in some matters a tendency that the minorities as such posses and are given certain special rights which are denied to the majority Subsequently Articles and A became Articles and respectively The deliberations of <ORG> show that initially <NAME> recommended that citizens belonging to national minority in the <ORG> whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other citizens in setting up and administering at their own expense charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establishments with the free use of their language and practice of their religion for being incorporated in the proposed Constitution of India This was with a view that the members of the majority community who are more in number may not at any point of time take away the rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institution of their choice It was very much clear that there was a clear intention that the rights given to minorities under Article were to be exercised by them if the institution established is administered at their own cost and expense It is for that reason we find that no educational institution either minority or majority has any common law right or fundamental right to receive financial assistance from the government Non discriminatory Clause of Article only provides that the <ORG> while giving grant in aid to the educational institutions shall not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority whether based on religion or language It may be seen that by accepting the amendment proposed by <NAME> the scope of Article was broadened inasmuch as the interest of minority either religious or linguistic was secured and therefore the intention of the framers of the Constitution for enacting Clause of Article was that once a minority institution takes government aid it becomes subject to Clause of Article There is no merit in the contention <NAME> amendment which was accepted was in relation to Clause of Article which ultimately has become Article It was also urged that if the framers of the Constitution intended to carve out a exception to Article they could have used the words subject to the provisions contained in Article in the beginning of Article or could have used the expression notwithstanding in the beginning of Article and in absence of such words it cannot be held that Article is an exception to Article Reference in this regard was made to Articles and which contained qualifying words it may be noted that there is a difference in the language of Articles and The absence of words to the other provisions of this part as occurring in Article in Article does not mean that Article is over and above other rights conferred in Part III of the Constitution it has been held that Article is subject to Article irrespective of the fact that the words subject to other provisions of this part occurring in Article is absent in Article For these reasons it must be held that even if there are no qualifying expression subject to other provisions of this part and notwithstanding anything either in Article or Article Article is subject to Article of the Constitution If Article is meant for the benefit of minority there was no sense in using the word caste in Article Although Article strictly may not be subject to reasonable restrictions it cannot be disputed that Article is subject to Article and also general laws and the laws made in the interests of national security public order morality and the like governing such institutions will have to be necessarily read into Article It therefore cannot be held that the fundamental right guaranteed under Article is absolute in terms The question then arises for what purpose the celebrated Article has been incorporated in the Constitution if the linguistic or religious minorities who establish educational institutions cannot admit their own students or are precluded from admitting members of their own communities in their own institution It is also urged that an assurance was given to the minorities that they would have a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institution of their choice and in case the minority cannot admit their own students or members of their own community it would be breach of the assurance given to the minorities There is no denial of the fact that in a democracy the rights and interest of minorities have to be protected In particular they shall have an equal right to maintain manage and control at their own expense or to establish in the future charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establishments with the right to use their own language and to exercise their religion freely therein Article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights CCPR guarantee minority rights in the following terms In those States in which ethnic religious or linguistic minorities exist persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right in community with the other members of their group to enjoy their own culture to profess and practice their own religions or to use their own language <NAME> in his celebrated study on the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic Religious or Linguistic Minorities stated as follows Article of the Covenant must therefore be placed in its proper context Under Article the minorities either linguistic or religious have right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice But right conferred on minority under Article would serve no purpose when they cannot admit students of their own community in their own institutions In order to make Article workable and meaningful such rights must be interpreted in the manner in which they serve the minorities as well as the mandate contained in Article On application of doctrine of the real de facto equality in such a situation not only Article would be workable and meaningful but it would also serve the mandate contained in Article Thus while maintaining the rule of non discrimination envisaged by Article the minorities should have also right to give preference to the students of their own community in the matter of admission in their own institution It is therefore necessary that minority be given preferential rights to admit students of their own community in their own institutions in a reasonable measure otherwise there would be no meaningful purpose of Article in the Constitution In case of minority professional institutions it can also be stipulated that passing of common entrance test held by the <ORG> agency is necessary to seek admission Another question that arises in this connection as to on what grounds the staff and teachers if aggrieved can challenge the arbitrary decisions of the management Though the questions referred to and re framed are eleven the <ORG> deemed it fit not to answer four of them On the contentions advanced by the learned counsel who argued these cases in regard to the remaining seven questions the learned Chief Justice has formulated the following five issues which encompass the entire field IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A RELIGIOUS OR LINGUISTIC MINORITY IN RELATION TO ARTICLE WHAT IS TO BE THE UNIT THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE Before I advert to these issues it would be appropriate to record that there was unanimity among the learned counsel appearing for the parties institutions States and the learned Solicitor General appearing for <ORG> on two aspects the first is that all the citizens have the right to establish educational institutions under Article and Article of the Constitution and the second is that the judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court in <ORG> <ORG> and Ors requires re consideration though there was some debate with regard to the aspects which require re consideration On this issue I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Hon ble the Chief Justice speaking for the majority However we shall refer to Articles and having a bearing on this issue All citizens shall have the right a to xxx xxx xxx to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business to xxx xxx xxx Nothing in Sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it relates to or prevent the State from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a <ORG> owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise We are concerned here with the right to establish educational institution to impart education at different levels primary secondary higher technical professional etc The mandate of Clause is that nothing is Sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making nay law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a <ORG> owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise Every religious denomination or a section thereof is conferred the right inter alia to establish and maintain institution for religious and charitable purpose incorporated in Clause a of Article which reads thus Freedom to manage religious affairs Subject to public order morality and health every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right a to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes to xxx xxx xxx If affords protection to minorities who have a distinct language script or culture of their own and declares that they shall have the right to conserve the same provided they form a section of citizens residing in the territory of India Article of the Constitution confers a special right on the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice A In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority referred to in Clause the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause Clause of Article provides that all minorities whether based on religion on language shall have the right i to establish and ii administer educational institutions of their choice It is significant to note that the right conferred under Article is not subjected to any limitations The right to establish and administer educational institutions is of the choice of the minorities The expression institutions of their choice means institutions for the benefit of the minorities the word choice encompasses both of the students as well as of the type of education to be imparted in such educational institutions IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A RELIGIOUS OR LINGUISTIC MINORITY IN RELATION TO ARTICLE WHAT IS TO BE THE UNIT THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE On these issues I respectfully agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the majority On this aspect I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of our learned sister <NAME> <NAME> I would give my reasons for this conclusion later In regard to question No reconsideration of the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> supra which relates to aided minority institutions I agree with the answer recorded in the majority judgment except to the extent of interplay between Article and and giving to the authorities power to prescribe a percentage having regard to the type of institution and educational needs of minorities With regard to answer to question No and the common answer to question Nos and in the light of the comments made above I would answer that all the citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles and The minorities have an additional right to establish and administer educational institution of their choice under Article A comparison of Articles and would show that whereas the educational institutions established and run by the citizens under Article and Article a are subject to the discipline of Articles and there are no such limitations in Article of the Constitution so in that the right conferred thereunder is absolute My answer to question is that the right of the minority institutions to admit students of the minority in any would not be affected in any way by receipt of <ORG> and I intend to dilate on this aspect of the matter in my separate reasoned opinion later Re Question What is the meaning and content of the expression minorities in Article of the Constitution of India Article affords protection to minorities in respect of limited rights namely the setting up and administration of an educational institution The question of protection raises three questions protection to whom against whom and against what The word minority means numerically less The protection under Article is against any measure legislative or otherwise which infringes the right granted under that article When the entire nation is sought to be affected surely the question of minority status must be determined with reference to the country as a whole In the subsequent decision in <ORG> State of Punjab I SCR Supp this Court opted for the first principle namely that the position of minorities should be determined in relation to the source of the legislation in question and it was clearly said Though there was a faint attempt to canvas the position that religious or linguistic minorities should be minorities in relation to the entire population of the country in our view they are to be determined only in relation to the particular legislation which is sought to be impugned namely that if it is the State legislature these minorities have to be determined in relation to the population of the State In <ORG> <ORG> of Punjab II SCR Supp Punjabi had been sought to be enforced as the sole medium of instruction and for examinations on the ground that it was the national policy of <ORG> to energetically develop Indian languages and literature If a minority status is to be determined only with respect to the territorial limits of a State non Hindi speaking persons who are in a majority in their own State but in a minority in relation to the rest of the country would not be able to impugn the legislation on the ground that it interferes with their right to preserve a distinct language and script In my opinion therefore the question whether a group is a minority or not must be determined in relation to the source and territorial application of the particular legislation against which protection is claimed and I would answer question accordingly In <ORG> the Court decided a that the minorities right to admit students under Article had to be balanced with the rights conferred under Article Therefore the <ORG> could regulate the admission of students of the minority institutions so that not more than of the available seats were filled in by the children of the minority community and the minority institution could evolve its own procedure for selecting students for admission in the institutions Article of the Constitution provides that All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Article on the other hand says that no citizen shall be denied admission into any education institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them If Article does not confer the right to admit students then of course there is no question of conflict with Article which covers the field of admission into any education institution The question therefore assumes that the right granted to minorities under Article involves the right to admit students Therefore the issue should be more appropriately framed as does the receipt of State aid and consequent admission of non minority students affect the rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institution of their choice I have sought to answer the question on an interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution so that no provision is rendered nugatory or redundant <NAME> and Ors Both Articles and are in Part III of the Constitution which deals with Fundamental Rights The rights guaranteed under the several parts of Part III of the Constitution overlap and provide different facets of the objects sought to be achieved by the Constitution In India the <ORG> is secular in that there is no official religion India is not a theocratic <ORG> The First Amendment to the American Constitution is as follows <ORG> shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof It reads The <ORG> shall not make any laws for establishing any religion or for imposing any religious observance or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the <ORG> Under the Indian Constitution there is no such wall of separation between the <ORG> and religious institutions And among the subjects over which both the <ORG> and the <ORG>s have legislative competence as set out in List No III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution Entry No are Charitable and charitable institutions charitable and religious endowments and religious institutions Although like other secular Governments the Indian Constitution in Article provides for freedom of conscience and the individual right freely to profess practice and propagate religion the right is expressly subject to public order morality and health and to the other provisions in Part III of the Constitution The involvement of the <ORG> with even the individual right under Article is exemplified by Article by which the <ORG> is empowered to make any law a regulating or restricting any economic financial political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus Freedom of religious groups or collective religious rights are provided for under Article which says that Subject to public order morality and health every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right a to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes Further the right to practise profess and propagate religion under Article if read with Article a would allow all citizens to exercise such rights through an educational institution The ostensible separation of religion and the <ORG> in the field of the <ORG>s revenue provided by Article which prohibits compulsion of an individual to pay any taxes which are specifically appropriated for the expenses for promoting or maintaining any particular religious or religious denomination does not however in terms prevent the <ORG> from making payment out of the proceeds of taxes generally collected towards the promotion or maintenance of any particular religious or religious denomination Article in fact brings to the fore the nature of the word secular used in the preamble to the Constitution and indicates clearly that there is no wall of separation between the <ORG> and religious institutions under the Indian Constitution It is subject to the extent of Sub Article of Article which provides that if the educational institution has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution then despite the prohibition in Article and despite the fact that the education institution is in fact administered by the <ORG> religious instruction can be imparted in such institution Article thus in no uncertain terms envisages that an educational institution administered by the <ORG> and wholly maintained by the <ORG> can impart religious instruction It recognises in Article that there may be educational institutions imparting religious instruction according to whichever faith and conducting religious worship which can be recognised by the <ORG> and which can also receive aid out of <ORG> funds Similarly Article provides that no individual attending any educational institution which may have been recognised by the <ORG> or is receiving <ORG> aid can be compelled to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution without such person consent Article and Article Equality which has been referred to in the Preamble is provided for in a group of Articles led by Article of the Constitution which says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Some of these are in Part III itself Article Article and Article Other such Articles conferring group rights or making special provision for a particular class include Articles and where special provision has been made for the Anglo Indian Community Further examples are to be found in Articles and other Articles giving immunity from the ordinary process of the law to persons holding certain offices On a plain reading of the provisions of the Article all minorities based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The emphasized words unambiguously and in mandatory terms grant the right to all minorities to establish and administer educational institutions The question then is does this special right in an admitted linguistic or religious minority to establish and administer an educational institution encompass the right to admit students belonging to that particular community Before considering the earlier decision on this a semantic analysis of the word used in Article of indicates that the right to admit students is an intrinsic part of Article First Article speaks of the right to set up an educational institution It is the activity which is carried on in the structure which gives it its character as an educational institution It follows that the right to set up an educational institution necessarily includes not only the selection of teachers or educators but also the admission of students Second Article speaks of the right to administer an educational institution The right to admit students is therefore part of the right to administer an educational institution Third the benefit which has been guaranteed under Article is a protection of benefit guaranteed to all members of the minority as a whole What is protected is the community right which includes the right of children of the minority community to receive education and the right of parents to have their children educated in such institution It would be meaningless to give the minorities the right to establish and set up an organisation for giving education as an end in itself and deny them the benefit of the education Finally the words of their choice is not qualified by any words of limitation and would include the right to admit students of the minority choice In Kerala Education Bill it was said The minorities quite understandably regard it as essential that the education of their children should be in accordance with the teachings of their religion and they hold quite honestly that such an education cannot be obtained in ordinary schools designed for all the members of the public but can only be secured in schools conducted under the influence and guidance of people well versed in the tenets of their religion and in the traditions of their culture The issue of admission to minority institutions under Article arose in the decision of Rev However in a statement which is diametrically opposed to the earlier decisions of this <ORG> it was held The choice of institution provided in Article does not mean that the minorities could establish educational institution for the benefit of their own community people If such was the aim Article would have been differently worded and it would have contained the words for their own community In the absence of such words it is legally impermissible to construe the article as conferring the right on the minorities to establish educational institution for their own benefit In that case there was no question of the non minority students being given admission overlooking the needs of the minority community That is a necessary concomitant right which flows from the right to establish and administer educational institution in Article There is also a related right to the parents in the minority communities There is nothing in Article which allows the drawing of a distinction in the exercise of the right under that Article between needy minorities and affluent ones Article of the Constitution reinforces this when it says The <ORG> shall not in granting aid to educational institutions discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority whether based on religion or language The argument is based on the construction of the word management Besides Article is an additional right conferred on minorities under Article I would therefore respectfully agree with the conclusion expressed in the majority opinion that grant of aid under Article cannot be used as a lever to take away the rights of the minorities under Article Articles and Article says that No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race case language or any of them It is because Article covers the right to admit students that there is an apparent conflict between Article and Article There are two ways of considering the relationship between Article and Article the first in the context of Article the second by an interpretation of Article itself Nevertheless in substance it confers a right on a person not to be denied admission into an aided institution only on the basis of religion race etc The language of Article reflects the language used in other non discriminatory Articles in the Constitution namely Clauses and of Article and Clauses and of Article As already noted both the Articles contain exceptions which permit laws being made which make special provisions on the basis of sex caste and race By the same token Article does not create an absolute right for citizens to be admitted into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds This is exemplified in Article which provides for Nothing in this article or in Clause of Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Tribes To the extent that legislation is enacted under Article making special provision in respect of a particular caste there is a denial of admission to others who do not belong to the caste Then again under Article grants are made available for the benefit of the Anglo Indian community in respect of education provided that any educational institution receiving such grant makes available at least of the annual admission for members of communities other than the Anglo Indian community To the extent of such reservation there is necessarily a denial of admission to non Anglo Indians on the basis of race Similarly the Constitution has also carved out a further exception to Article in the form of Article by recognising the rights of special classes in the form of minorities based on language or religion to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The reason for such classification is not only religion or language per se but minorities based on religion and language As <NAME> said if there is any doubt in the interpretation of the words in the section the heading certainly helps us to resolve that doubt When aid is sought for by the minority institution to run its institution for the benefit of students belonging to that particular community the argument on the basis of Article is that if such an institution asks for aid it does so at the peril of depriving the very persons for whom aid was asked for in the first place The argument proceeds on the assumption that an educational institution set up under Article is set up for the purposes and with the sole object of giving religious instruction Furthermore the right to set up an educational institution in which religious instruction is to be imparted is a right which is derived from Article a which provides that every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and not under Article This follows from the fact that it has been separately and expressly provided for and there is nothing in the language of Article making the right thereunder subject to Articles and Whereas if one reads Article as subject to Article then effect can be given to both But once the minority educational institution travels beyond the needs in the sense of requirements of its own community at that stage it is no longer exercising rights of admission guaranteed under Article To put it differently when the right of admission is exercised not to meet the need of the minorities the rights of admission given under Article is to that extent removed and the institution is bound to admit students for the balance in keeping with the provisions of Article I would therefore not subscribe to the view that Article operates to deprive aided minority institutions the right to admit members of their community to educational institutions established and administered by them either on any principle of interpretation or on any concept of equality or secularism Ultimately it is for this <ORG> to say what is meant by the words of the Constitution The proponents of the argument that Article over rides Article have referred to excerpts from the speeches made by members of Constituent Assembly which have been quoted in support of their view The intention indicated in the speeches relating to the framing of Article appears to be an extension of the right of non discrimination to members of the non minority in respect of <ORG> aided or <ORG> maintained educational institutions The history which preluded the independence of this country and the framing of the Constitution highlights the political context in which the Constitution was framed and the political content of the special rights given to minorities This has been adequately done by <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> State of Kerala on the basis of which the learned Judge came to the conclusion that the rights of the minorities under the Constitution formed part of the basic structure of the Constitution and were un amendable and inalienable The recognition of the principle of unity in diversity has continued to be the hall mark of the Constitution a concept which has been further strengthened by affording further support to the protection of minorities on linguistic bases in by way of Articles A and and in by introducing Clause A in Article requiring the <ORG> that is to say <ORG> in the case of a Central legislation or a <ORG> legislature in the case of <ORG> legislation in making a specific law to provide for the compulsory acquisition of the property of minority educational institutions to ensure that the amount payable to the educational institution for the acquisition of its property will not be such as will in any manner impair the functioning of the educational institution The contention on the part of the executive then was that a minority institution could not avail of the protection of Article if there was any non minority element either in the establishment administration admission or subjects taught It was in that context that the <ORG> in Kerala Education Bill held that a sprinkling of outsiders being admitted into a minority institution did not result in the minority institution shedding its character and ceasing to be a minority institution It was also in that context that the <ORG> in <ORG> supra came to the conclusion that a minority institution based on religion and language had the right to establish and administer educational institution for imparting general secular education and still not lose its minority character There is thus no question of striking a balance between Article and as if they were two competing rights I agree with the view as expressed by the Learned Chief Justice that there is no question of fixing a percentage when the need may be variable If the non minority student is otherwise eligible for admission the decision on the issue of refusal would depend on whether the minority institution is able to establish that the refusal was only because it was satisfying the requirements of its own community under Article If the <ORG> is given the power to determine the requirements of the minority community in the matter of admission to its educational institutions we would be subjecting the minority educational institution in question to an intolerable encroachment on the right under Article and let in by the back door as it were what should be denied entry altogether We have had the advantage of going through the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of India brother justice <NAME> brother Justice <NAME> and sister Justice <NAME> We are unable to agree with the views expressed by brother Justice <NAME> and sister Justice <NAME> Is there a fundamental right to set up educational institutions and if so under which provision Does the judgment in <NAME> case require reconsideration In case of private unaided institutions can there be Government regulations and if so the what extent In determining the existence of a religious or linguistic minority in relation to Article what is to be the unit the State or Country as a whole and To what extent the rights of aided minority institutions to administer be regulated Thus we agree with the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice that the scheme cannot be considered to be a reasonable restriction and requires reconsideration and that the regulations must be minimum However we cannot lose sight of the ground realities in our country There must therefore be an attempt not just on the part of the <ORG> and the <ORG> but also by the educational institutions to ensure that students from the poorer section of society get admission In respect of categories and we wish to point out that this <ORG> has been constantly taking the view that these aided educational institutions whether majority or minority should not have unfettered freedom in the matter of administration and management The <ORG> which gives aid to educational institution including minority educational institution can impose such conditions as are necessary for the proper maintenance for the higher standards of education In many <ORG>s there are various statutory provisions to regulate the functioning of these educational institutions The provisions contained in the various enactments are not specially challenged before us Educational Institution receiving <ORG> aid cannot claim to have complete autonomy in the matter of administration But in some <ORG>s the entire salary of the teaching and non teaching staff are paid and these employees are given pension and other benefits the <ORG> may then have a right and an obligation to see that the selection and appointment of teachers are properly made Similarly the <ORG> could impose conditions to the effect that in the matter of appointments preference shall be given to weaker sections of the community specially physically handicapped or dependents of employees who died in harness As this decision is being rendered by a larger bench consisting of eleven judges we feel that it is not advisable and we should not be taken to have laid down extensive guidelines in respect of myriads of legal questions that may arise for consideration As regards category we agree with the conclusion of both the learned Chief Justice as well as Justice <NAME> that Article applies to Article However in our view there is need to emphasise the same It has been held that <ORG> debates are not conclusive but that in a Constitutional matter where the intent of the framers of the Constitution is to be ascertained the <ORG> should look into the proceedings and the relevant data including the speeches which throw light on ascertaining the intent Initially there was a demand for separate electorate and reservation of seats The relevant portion reads as follows The right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice has been conferred on religious and linguistic minorities so that the majority who can always having their rights by having proper legislation do not pass a legislation prohibiting minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx Every section of the public the majority as well as minority has rights in respect of religion as contemplated in Articles and and rights in respect of language script culture as contemplated in Article If religious or linguistic minorities are not given protection under Article to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice they will feel isolated and separate emphasis supplied In the same Judgment Justice <NAME> has held as follows Before we deal with the contentions advanced before us and the scope and ambit of Article of the Constitution it may be pertinent to refer to the historical background Citizens belonging to national minorities in a State whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other citizens in forming controlling and administering at their own expense charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establishments with the free use of their language and practice of their religion It shall be the duty of every unit to provide in the public educational system in towns and districts in which a considerable proportion of citizens of other than the language of the unit are residents adequate facilities for ensuring that in the primary schools the instruction shall be given to the children of such citizens through the medium of their own language This shows that the intention was to give to the minorities the right to form control and administer amongst others educational institutions at their own expense All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion subject to public order morality or health and to the other provisions of this Part Every religious denomination or a section thereof shall have the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion and subject to law to own acquire and administer property movable and immovable and to establish and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes The Constituent Assembly Debates of th August indicate that it was understood and clear that the right to establish and administer educational institutions was to be at their own expense To be noted that both Mr <NAME> and Mrs <NAME> were by their proposed amendments seeking to enhance rights of minorities While we welcome such donations when a principle has been laid down that if any institution receives <ORG> aid it cannot discriminate or refuse admission to members of other communities then it should be followed If he had explained it probably the <ORG> would have been convinced Now this as I said can best be done by legislation in the provinces through the administrative action of the <ORG> which takes into consideration susceptibilities and sometimes makes allowances for certain conditions Thus to be seen that Mr <NAME> echoed the sentiment so often expressed by Counsel before us i that by securing a small amount of aid the right to administer educational institutions cannot be given up I think there is nothing wrong with the amendment which has been moved by Mrs <NAME> No institution receiving <ORG> aid should close its door to any other class of persons in India merely because its donor has originally so desired to restrict His view was that if we accepted the principle that educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> shall be bound to admit boys of all communities it would be a great gain and that we should not mix up this matter with other matters howsoever important they may be Nevertheless I think that it is desirable in view of the importance that we have attached to various provisions accepted by us regarding the development of a feeling of unity in the country that we should today accept the principle that a boy shall be at liberty to join any school whether maintained by the <ORG> or by any private agency which receives aid from <ORG> funds The protection which was being given to the minorities was merely to ensure that the politically strong majority did not prevent the minorities from having educational institutions at their own expense On this basis the amendments moved by Mr <NAME> and Mrs <NAME> which sought to create additional rights in favour of minorities were rejected No religious instruction shall be provided by the <ORG> in any educational institution wholly maintained out of <ORG> funds Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the <ORG> but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution No minority whether based on religion community or language shall be discriminated against the regard to the admission of any person belonging to such minority into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> a All minorities whether based on religion community or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice It must be noted that there was a practice to circulate in advance any proposed amendment which a Member desired to move If we scan the various clauses of this article carefully and turn a sidelong glance at the next articles too we will find that there are some inconsistencies or at least an inconsistency I am afraid I will have to turn to Clause Sub clause a where it is said that all minorities whether based on religion community or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice There is no point about <ORG> aid but I cannot certainly understand why the <ORG> should refuse recognition to those institutions established by minorities where they insist on compulsory attendance at religious classes If minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their own choice is it contended by the Honourable Dr <NAME> that the <ORG> will say You can have institutions but you should not have religious instructions in them if you want our recognition If the minorities Christians and Muslims can administer those institutions according to their choice and manner does the <ORG> mean to suggest that the <ORG> shall not recognize such institutions Sir to my mind if you pursue such a course the promises we have made to the minorities in our country the promises we have made to the ear we shall have broken to the heart He is pointing out that there is an apparent conflict between these two Articles Dr <NAME> opposed the amendments proposed by <NAME> for various reasons one of which is as follows We have accepted the proposition which is embodied in Article that public funds raised by taxes shall not be utilised for the benefit of any particular community To be noted that in the draft Articles there is no clause which provided that if an institution whether maintained by the community or not gets a grant it shall keep the school open to all communities That for amendment No of the List of amendments the following be substituted That for Clause of Article the following be substituted No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds of grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Sir I find there are three points of difference between this amendment and the provisions of the section which it seeks to amend Thirdly we have instead of the words religion community or language the words religion race caste language or any of them Unfortunately there is in some matters a tendency that the minorities as such possess and are given certain special rights which are denied to the majority There are a very large number of such institutions and in future by this amendment the rights of the minority have been broadened and the rights of the majority have been secured The whole purpose is to further principles of secularism and to see that in <ORG> maintained and <ORG> aided educational institutions there was no distinction between majority or minority communities Vice President The question is That for Clause of Articles the following be substituted No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them and Sub clause a and of Clause of Article be renumbered as new Article A This being the historical background and the intention of the framers the contextual approach must also be one which gives effect to the minority rights but which does not elevate them into a special or privileged class of citizens The contextual approach must therefore be that minorities have full rights to establish and administer educational institution at their own costs but if they choose to take State aid they must then abide by the Constitutional mandate of Article and with principles of equality and secularism The framers unambiguously and unanimously intended that rights given under Article could be fully enjoyed so long as the educational institutions were established and administered at their own costs and expense A plain reading of Article shows that it applies to any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds A plain reading of the two Articles indicates that the rights given under Article can be fully exercised so long as no aid is taken from the <ORG> In cases where the <ORG> gives aid to educational institutions the <ORG> would be bound by the Constitutional mandate of Article to ensure that no citizen is denied admission into the educational institution on grounds of religion race caste language or any of them To be noted that Article does not provide that <ORG> shall not in granting aid impose any condition which would restrict or abridge the rights guaranteed under Article Even though a plain reading of Articles and Article leads to no clash between the two Articles it has been submitted by counsel on behalf of minorities that the right to establish and administer educational institutions be considered an absolute right and that by giving aid the <ORG> cannot impose conditions which would restrict or abrogate and or abridge in any manner the right under Article It has been submitted that the right to administer educational institutions includes the right to admit students It has been submitted that the minorities whether based on religion or language have a right to admit students of their community All counsel appearing for the minority educational institutions conceded that rights under Article are subject to general secular laws of the country If Article were to be read in a manner which permits <ORG> aided minority educational institutions to admit students as per their choice then they could refuse to admit students who do not agree to take part in religious instructions In all fairness to all the counsels appearing for minority educational institutions it must be stated that not a single counsel argued that Article would not govern Article As is being held all citizens have a fundamental right to establish and carry on an educational institution under Article An educational institution could also be established under Article for purposes of conserving a distinct language script or culture We cannot give to Article a meaning which would result in making the minorities whether religious or linguistic a special or privileged class of citizens We should give to Article a meaning which would further the basic and overriding principles of our Constitution viz It has also been submitted that a minority educational institute would have been established only for the purpose of giving education to students of that particular religious or linguistic community If an educational institute established by a majority community for members of that community only takes <ORG>s aid it would then lose the right to admit only students of its own community Article merely protects the right of the minority to establish and administer an educational institution i to have the same rights as those enjoyed by majority Article gives no right to receive <ORG> aid At this stage there is no common entrance test which determines merit Thus whilst admitting at this stage preference can always be given to members of their own community so long as some students of other communities are also admitted and denial is not on basis of religion race caste language or any of them More importantly there is no reason to believe that students of these minority communities will not be able to compete on merit To be remembered that there is no compulsion to receive State aid Now let us see whether the principles of stare decisis require us to take a different view On behalf of the <ORG> it was argued that there was no discrimination and no infringement of fundamental rights This argument was repelled and it was held as follows It will be noticed that while Clause protects the language script or culture of a section of the citizens Clause guarantees the fundamental right of an individual citizen The right to get admission into any educational institution of the kind mentioned in Clause is a right which an individual citizen has as a citizen and not as a member of any community or class of citizens If a citizen who seeks admission into any such educational institution has not the requisite academic qualifications and is denied admission on that ground he certainly cannot be heard to complain of an infraction of his fundamental right under this article But on the other hand if he has the academic qualifications but is refused admission only on ground of religion race caste language or any of them then there is a clear breach of his fundamental rights He may have secured higher marks than the Anglo Indian and Indian Christians or Muslim candidates but nevertheless he cannot get any of the seats reserved for the last mentioned communities for no fault of his except that he is a Brahmin and not a member of the aforesaid communities In our view the classification made in the Communal is opposed to the Constitution and constitutes a clear violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizen under Article There were reservations for Anglo Indians Indian Christians Muslims Brahmins and Non Brahmins Nothing in this article or in Clause of Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Significantly no such amendment was made in Article even though reservations in favour of minority communities was also held to be violative of Article In the first place he contends that Article does not confer any fundamental right on all citizens generally but guarantees the rights of citizens of minority groups by providing that they must not be denied admission to educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of the <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them and he refers us to the marginal note to the article It does not appear to have been specifically taken in the affidavits in opposition filed in <ORG> and there is not indication in the judgment under appeal that it was advanced in this form before <ORG> Article gives protection to any section of the citizens having a distinct language script or culture by guaranteeing their right to conserve the same Article secures to all minorities whether based on religion or language the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Nor do we see any reason to limit Article to citizens belonging to a minority group other than the section or the minorities referred to in Article or Article for the citizens who do no belong to any minority group may quite conceivably need this protection just as much as the citizens of such other minority groups If it is urged that the citizens of the majority group are amply protected by Article and do not require the protection of Article then there are several obvious answers to that argument Article confers a special right on citizens for admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the <ORG> To limit this right only to citizens belonging to minority groups will be to provide a double protection for such citizens and to hold that the citizens of the majority group have no special educational rights in the nature of a right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of which they make contributions by way of taxes We see no cogent reason for such discrimination The right to get admission into any educational institution of the kind mentioned in Clause is a right which an individual citizen has as a citizen and not as a member of any community or class of citizens emphasis supplied In this case it was also argued that the word only in Article had to be given some meaning and that the circular order did not deny citizens admission only on ground of religion race caste language or any of them It was submitted that thus there was no denial only on the ground of religion race caste language or any of them In our opinion the impugned order offends against the fundamental right guaranteed to all citizens by Article In Re The Kerala Education Bill reported in SCR the President of India made a Reference under Article of the Constitution of India for obtaining opinion of this Court upon certain questions relating to the constitutional validity of some of the provisions of the Kerala Education Bill which had been passed by <ORG> but had been reserved by the Governor for consideration of the President of India Question Articles and are set out in Part III of our Constitution which guarantees our fundamental rights It is obvious that a minority community can effectively conserve its language script or culture by and though educational institutions and therefore the right to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice is a necessary concomitant to the right to conserve its distinctive language script or culture and that is what is conferred on all minorities by Article which has hereinbefore been quoted in full This right however is subject to Clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Likewise Article provides inter alia that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Learned counsel appearing for two Anglo Indian schools contends that the <ORG> of Kerala is bound to implement the provisions of Article In this case it was argued on behalf of the <ORG> that as the minority instate received <ORG> aid it was bound by virtue of Article to admit students of all communities and thus did not retain its minority character The argument that it lost its minority character because it admitted students of other communities was repelled in the following terms On the contrary as is set out on page of the Report it was an admitted position that these institutions did not deny admissions to students belonging to other communities All observations made in this case are in this context In this case also it is held that the rights under Article are subject to reasonable restrictions and regulations The petitioners challenged the virus of the provision and claimed that it affected their rights under Article of the Constitution One of the arguments raised on behalf of the <ORG> was that since the admissions were not reserved only for students of the Jesuits community the college did not qualify for protection under Article This case thus shows that even if members of other community are admitted into the institution the institution would still remain a minority institution which is under the management of the minority This Court held that rights under Article could only be claimed by Indian citizens but Article guarantees the rights of minority In this case there is no discussion regarding the effect of Article on Article It was held that this violated the rights under Article as well as Article inasmuch as the right to have an educational institution of a choice includes the right to have a choice of the medium of instruction also Sub section of Section of the Act provided that the university shall make provision for study and research on the life and teaching of <NAME> and their cultural and religious impact in the context of Indian and World Civilisation and Sub section enjoined the <ORG> to promote studies to provide for research in Punjabi language and literature and to undertake measures for the development of Punjabi language literature and culture It was held that Clause a interfered with the right of the religious minority to administer their educational institutions but that Clause did not suffer from the same vice It must be observed that whilst dealing with the Articles and this Court observed as follows It will be observed that Article is wider than Article in that while any Section of the citizens including the minorities can invoke the rights guaranteed under Article the rights guaranteed under Article are only available to the minorities based on religion or language A reading of these two Articles together would lead us to conclude that a religious or linguistic minority has a right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice for effectively conserving its distinctive language script or culture which right however is subject to the regulatory power of the <ORG> for maintaining and facilitating the excellence of its standards This right is further subject to Clause of Article which provides that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution which is maintained by the <ORG> or receives aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The law laid down in <NAME> case in <ORG> case and in Kerala Education Bill case has been reaffirmed The authority on which strong reliance has been placed by the counsel of the minority is <ORG> case supra Sub section of Section stated that the State Government shall issue a notification declaring that the provisions of Section shall come into force on such date as may be specified in the notification <ORG> contended that they had a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and that such a right included the right of affiliation They therefore challenged the constitutional validity of the above Sections Thus the <ORG> never claimed the right to only admit students of its own community This test reads as follows Such regulation must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it emphasis supplied Thus it is held by the majority that the institute is to be made an effective vehicle of education not just for the minority community but also for other persons who resort to do This aspect is clearly brought out in the Judgment of Justice <NAME> who whilst dealing with the various provisions of the Constitution held as follows A glance at the context and scheme of Part III of the Constitution would show that the Constitution makers did not intend to confer absolute rights on a religious or linguistic minority to establish and administer educational institutions No religious or linguistic minority establishing and administering an educational institution which receives aid from the <ORG> funds shall deny admission to any citizen to the institution on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them The right to admit a student to an educational institution is admittedly comprised in the right to administer it Article enables the <ORG> to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes in the matter of admission in the educational institutions maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid from the <ORG> Article imposes a third restriction on the right in Article Obviously Article prohibits a religious minority establishing and administering an educational institution which receives aid or is recognised by the <ORG> from compelling any citizen reading in the institution to receive religious instruction against his wishes or if minor against the wishes of his guardian It cannot be disputed that the right of a religious minority to impart religious instruction in an educational institution forms part of the right to administer the institution There are also certain implied limitations on this right This case also holds that reasonable restrictions can be placed on the rights under Article subject to the test set out hereinabove The Petitioners filed a Writ Petition in <ORG> challenging the imposition of such a condition on the ground that it was violative of their rights under Article Of course Counsel for the minorities were claiming a right to admit students of their own community even to the extent of With the greatest of respect to the learned Judges concerned once it was held that Article applied to Article there was no question of trying to balance rights or to seek a compromise It must be noted that in <ORG> case in his minority judgment he has held that Article governs Article and that if the minority educational institute chooses to take aid it must comply with the constitutional mandate of Article It therefore cannot form the basis for applying the principles of State Decisis Thus from any point of view i historical or contextual or on principles of pure interpretation or on principles of stare decisis the only interpretation possible is that the rights under Article are conferred on minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice at their own cost The right is a special right which is given by way of protection so that the majority which is politically powerful does not prevent the minorities from establishing their educational institutions What has been granted to them is a right which was equal to the rights enjoyed by the majority community namely to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice at their own cost But if they choose to take <ORG> aid then they have to comply with constitutional mandates which are based on principles which are as important as if not more important than the rights given to the minorities Our Constitution mandates that all citizens are equal and that no citizen can be denied admission into educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Of course as stated above preferences could always be given to students of their own community They could give some preference to students coming from their own schools Once the language is clear and unambiguous full effect must be given to Article irrespective of the consequences As there is no conflict the question of balancing rights under Article and Article of the Constitution does not arise In view of above discussion we answer the questions as follows What is the meaning and content of the expression minorities in Article of the Constitution of India A Linguistic and religious minorities are covered by the expression minority under Article of the Constitution Since reorganization of the States in India has been on linguistic lines therefore for the purpose of determining the minority the unit will be the State and not the whole of India Thus religious and linguistic minorities who have been put at par in Article have to be considered state wise What is meant by the expression religion in Article Can the followers of a sect or denomination of a particular religion claim protection under Article on the basis that they constitute a minority in the State even though the followers of that religion are in majority in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench a What are the indicia for treating an educational institution as a minority educational institution Would an institution be regarded as a minority educational institution because it was established by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority or its being administered by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority A This question need not be answered by this <ORG> it will be dealt with by a regular <ORG> To what extent can professional education be treated as a matter coming under minorities rights under Article A Article gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The use of the words of their choice indicates that professional educational institutions would be covered by Article Whether the admission of students to minority educational institution whether aided or unaided can be regulated by <ORG> or by the <ORG> to which the institution is affiliated A Admission of students to unaided minority educational institutions viz Schools where scope for merit based selection is practically nil cannot be regulated by the <ORG> or the <ORG> except for providing the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards Right to admit students being an essential facet of right to administer educational institutions of their choice as contemplated under Article of the Constitution <ORG> or the <ORG> may not be entitled to interfere with that right in respect of unaided minority institutions provided however that the admission to the unaided educational institutions is on transparent basis and the merit is the criteria In other words it cannot then give preference to students of its own community In the case of aided professional institutions it can also be stipulated that passing of common entrance test held by the <ORG> agency is necessary to seek admission a Whether the minority rights to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice will include the procedure and method of admission and selection of students A A minority institution may have its own procedure and method of admission as well as selection of students but such procedure must be fair and transparent and selection of students in professional and higher educational colleges should be on the basis of merit Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore merit of the students for admission while exercising its right to admit students to the colleges aforesaid as in that event The institution will fail to achieve excellence Whether the minority institutions right of admission of students and to lay down procedure and method of admission if any would be affected in any way by the receipt of State aid A Further to what is stated in answer to question No it must be stated that whilst giving aid to professional institutions it would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe by rules or regulations the conditions on the basis of which admission will be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with the reservation policy of the state The merit may be determined either through a common entrance test conducted by the <ORG> or the <ORG> followed by counselling or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by individual institutions the method to be followed is for the university or the government to decide The authority may also devise other means to ensure that admission is granted to an aided professional institution on the basis of merit In the case of such institutions it will be permissible for the government or the university to provide that consideration should be shown to the weaker sections of the society Whether the statutory Provisions which regulate the facets of administration like control over educational agencies control over governing bodies conditions of affiliation including recognition withdrawal thereof and appointment of state employees teachers and Principals including their service conditions and regulation of fees etc would interfere with the right of administration of minorities A So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets administration is concerned in case of an unaided minority educational institution the regulatory measure of control should be minimal and the conditions of recognition as well as conditions of affiliation to an <ORG> or <ORG> have to be complied with but in the matter of day to day Management like appointment of staff teaching and non teaching and administrative control over them the Management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency However a rational procedure for selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the Management itself For redressing the grievances of such employees who are subjected to punishment or termination from service a mechanism will have to be evolved and in our opinion appropriate tribunals could be constituted and till then such tribunal could be presided over by a Judicial officer of the rank of District Judge The state or other controlling authorities however can always prescribe the minimum qualifications salaries experience and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for being appointed as a teacher of an educational institution Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the <ORG> without interfering with overall administrative control of Management over the staff <ORG> representative can be associated with the selection committee and the guidelines for selection can be laid down There could be appropriate mechanism to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and profiteering is not restored to a Where can minority institution be operationally located Where a religious or linguistic minority in State A establishes an educational institution in the said State can such educational institution grant preferential admission reservations and other benefits to members of the religious linguistic group from other States where they are non minorities A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench Whether it would be correct to say that only the members of that minority residing in State A will be treated as the members of the minority vis a vis such institution A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench Whether the member of a linguistic non minority in one State can establish a trust society in another State and claim minority status in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right and the scheme framed thereunder require reconsideration modification and if yes what A The scheme framed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case and the direction to impose the same except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right is unconstitutional Reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not however amount to profiteering Whether the non minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institution under Articles and read with Article and in the same manner and to the same extent as minority institutions and What is the meaning of the expressions Education and Educational Institutions in various provisions of the Constitution Is the right to establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under the Constitution A The expression education in the Articles of the Constitution means and includes education at all levels from the primary school level up to the post graduate level It includes professional education The expression educational institutions means institutions that impart education where education is as understood hereinabove The right to establish and administer educational institutions is guaranteed under the Constitution to all citizens under Article and and to minorities specifically under Article All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles and but this right will be subject to the provisions of Articles and a However minority institutions will have a right to admit students belonging to the minority group in the manner as discussed in this judgment
