As all the cases involve similar questions of fact and law they were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment As the provisions of sub section of Section of the Act were applied notices were issued on th October under Section of the Act to the claimants for payment of compensation in respect of the acquired land A reference in terms of Section of the Act was made which was answered by the learned Additional District Judge Ghaziabad by a order dated nd October determining the amount of compensation Rs per sq In continuation of para of that letter this is to inform you that there are five cases in which delivery of possession is shown to have been given As per sub section A to Section of the Land Acquisition Act it is made obligatory that before taking possession of any land the Collector shall pay of the compensation to the interested persons This mandatory provision not having been complied with the delivery of possession on paper has no legal force and that is why land owners did not allow <ORG> to take possession of these lands Since no legally valid possession has been given to <ORG> nor land owners have allowed <ORG> to take possession of these lands mutations in revenue records made need to be set right by necessary correction proceedings On or about th September the appellant filed an application for vacating the stay which having been refused a Special Leave Petition was filed before this Court which was dismissed by an order dated th October Indisputably on the same day the same Bench passed judgment in <ORG> preferred by appellant <ORG> against the order of <ORG> dated nd October Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> would contend that although in the event possession had been taken by the Collector from the land owners Section of the Act will have no application but in view of the fact that possession of acres of land had not been delivered in favour of <ORG> and merely a symbolic possession had been delivered <ORG> must be held to have committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents on the other hand would contend i Having regard to the provisions contained in Section of the Act as the vesting of the acquired land takes place immediately the impugned Notification dated th November has rightly been held to be illegal and without jurisdiction iii The fact that the possession of the entire land had been taken over not only would appear from the materials brought on record during the land acquisition proceedings culminating in passing of the Award but also from the award of <ORG> as also the judgment of <ORG> in the First Appeals and in that view of the matter it would not be correct to contend that <ORG> could not have entered into such disputed questions of fact particularly when the validity or otherwise of the proceedings is not in question Sub sections A and of the Act read as under In cases of urgency whenever the Appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any waste or arable land needed for a public purpose A Before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the Collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does not so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section Indisputably the said provisions were been taken recourse to and thus the lands under acquisition vested absolutely in the Government Section of the Act providing for taking over possession of the land after making the Award would not be applicable in this case as possession is said to have already been taken over in terms of sub section of Section thereof Whether actual or symbolic possession had been taken over from the land owners is essentially a question of fact Mr <NAME> however would draw our attention to a letter dated issued by the appellant to the District Magistrate to contend that even payment of of the compensation had not made and thus the purported delivery of possession was merely a papr transaction Our attention had further been drawn to the written statement filed on behalf of the appellant before the reference court which reads as under That out of the total acquired area in question the respondent utilized only a portion of the land by construction of their Satellite building while remaining area could not be put into use by the respondent since the land is in actual physical possession of the land owners and they are deriving all the benefits from the land thereof and the respondent is having only a symbolic possession over the same <ORG> also in its judgment held The petitioners will get per annum as additional amount on the above market value for the period commencing from the date of publication of the notification In the memo of appeal preferred by the appellant before <ORG> a statement was made that the possession of the land was taken by invoking Section of the Act on and thus interest at the rate of per annum on the excess amount under the provisions of Section of the Act would be payble only in the case where such excess payment had not been made before the expiry of one year period from the date on which the possession has been taken and as determined by the <ORG> In view of the stand taken by the appellant before <ORG> as also the reference court and <ORG> in our opinion it is estopped and precluded from raising a plea contra There can be no question of taking symbolical possession in the sense understood by judicial decisions under the Code of Civil Procedure What the Act contemplates as a necessary condition of vesting of the land in the <ORG> is the taking of actual possession of the land How such possession may be taken would depend on the nature of the land There can be no hard and fast rule laying down what act would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land We should not therefore be taken as laying down an absolute and inviolable rule that merely going on the spot and making a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land in every case But here in our opinion since the land was lying fallow and there was no crop on it at the material time the act of the Tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and determining its extent was sufficient to constitute taking of possession It is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or the occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time though it may be desirable where possible to give such notice before possession is taken by the authorities as that would eliminate the possibility of any fraudulent or collusive transaction of taking of mere paper possession without the occupant or the owner ever coming to know of it The question as to whether actual physical possession had been taken in compliance of the provisions of Section of the Act or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case Even in the said certificate of possession it had not been stated that there were standing crops on the land on the date on which possession was taken There is no provision by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> reverts to the original owner by mere cancellation of the notification in the context of applicablility of Section A of the Act it was stated When Section is applied by reason of urgency <ORG> takes possession of the land prior to the making of the award under Section and thereupon the owner is divested of the title to the land which is vested in the <ORG> Clearly Section A can have no application to cases of acquisitions under Section because the lands have already vested in the <ORG> and there is no provision in the said Act by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> can revert to the owner Just as publication of a notification under Section vests the land in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances as provided by Section similarly when possession of land is taken under Section the land vests absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances A question arose before this Court that if there is a non compliance with the provisions of Section A and an award is not made in respect to the land so acquired would the acquisition proceedings lapse this Court held that once possession had been taken under Section and the land vested in the <ORG> then the <ORG> could not withdraw from acquisition under Section and the provisions of Section A were not attracted and therefore the acquisition proceedings would not lapse on failure to make an award within the period prescribed therein the question arose whether notification under Section and the declaration under Section get lapsed if the award is not made within two years as envisaged under Section A A Bench of three Judges had held that once possession was taken and the land vested in the <ORG> title to the land so vested in the State is subject only to determination of compensation and to pay the same to the owner Only Section gives power to withdraw from acquisition that too before possession is taken That question did not arise in this case The exercise of the power to quash the notification under Section and the declaration under Section would lead to incongruity this <ORG> has categorically laid down that when the accepted mode of taking possession of the acquired land is resorted to that would constitute taking possession of the land We may now consider the question as to whether the issue as to whether possession of the acquired land had actually been taken over or not being a disputed question of fact could not have gone into by <ORG> There is no law that <ORG> is denied or debarred from entering into a disputed question of fact From the averments made in the petition filed by the appellants it is clear that in proof of a large number of allegations the appellants relied upon documentary evidence and the only matter in respect of which conflict of facts may possibly arise related to the due publication of the notification under Section by the Collector <ORG> has jurisdiction to determine questions of fact even if they are in dispute and the present in our judgment is a case in which in the interests of both the parties <ORG> should have entertained the petition and called for an affidavit in reply from the respondents and should have proceeded to try the petition instead of relegating the appellants to a separate suit Section of the Code to which reference has been made makes it clear that the provisions of the Code in regard to suits shall be followed in all proceedings in any court of civil jurisdiction as far as it can be made applicable The words as far as it can be made applicable make it clear that in applying the various provisions of the Code to proceedings other than those of a suit the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought If however on consideration of the nature of the controversy <ORG> decides as in the present case that it should go into a disputed question of fact and the discretion exercised by <ORG> appears to be sound and in conformity with judicial principles this Court would not interfere in appeal with the order made by <ORG> in this respect No doubt Shri <NAME> has contended that the appellant still retained their possession It is now well settled legal position that it is difficult to take physical possession of the land under compulsory acquisition The normal mode of taking possession is drafting the panchnama in the presence of panchas and taking possession and giving delivery to the beneficiaries is the accepted mode of taking possession of the land Subsequent thereto the retention of possession would tantamount only to illegal or unlawful possession There is no plea in the writ petition that a request for reconveyance was made in terms of Section of the Act as amended in the <ORG> of Tamil Nadu The <ORG> can dispose of the property thereafter or convey it to anyone if the land is not needed for the purpose for which it was acquired only for the market value that may be fetched for the property as on the date of conveyance It is settled law that if the land is acquired for a public purpose after the public purpose was achieved the rest of the land could be used for any other public purpose In case there is no other public purpose for which the land is needed then instead of disposal by way of sale to the erstwhile owner the land should be put to public auction and the amount fetched in the public auction can be better utilised for the public purpose envisaged in the Directive Principles of the Constitution Otherwise the land of the <ORG> should be sold only through the public auctions so that the public also gets benefited by getting a higher value Mr <NAME> however made an alternative submission before us that this <ORG> in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article of Constitution of India may issue necessary directions so as to put a quietus to the entire matter However before us Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents when questioned categorically stated that in view of the statement made in the counter affidavit the positive case of the respondents is that they had not been in possession If the aforementioned statement made by the respondents is found to be incorrect legal steps as is permissible in law may be taken If the land was not used for the purpose for which it was acquired it was open to <ORG> to take action but that did not confer any right on the respondents to ask for restitution of the land It is not as if lands acquired for a particular public purpose cannot be utilised for another public purpose He contended that as long as the acquisition is not held to be mala fide the acquisition cannot be invalidated merely because the lands which at one time were proposed to be utilised for a particular public purpose were later either in whole or in part utilised for some other purpose though a public purpose He therefore submitted that some change of user of the land as long as it has a public purpose would not invalidate the acquisition proceeding which is otherwise valid and legal Thus it cannot be said that the land is actually being utilised for any purpose other than that for which it was acquired Moreover since there is no change of public purpose for which the acquired land is being utilised the acquisition cannot be invalidated on that ground Having regard to the facts of the case it cannot be contended nor has it been contended that the notification under Section of the Act was issued mala fide Counsel fee assessed at Rs in each of these appeals
