Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by <ORG> of <ORG> at Jodhpur confirming the death sentence awarded to the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section of the Indian Penal Code in short the IPC Appellant also filed an appeal and both the case under reference and the appeal were taken up together and disposed of by a common judgment The trial court on consideration of the evidence led by the prosecution found the appellant guilty of offence under Section I <ORG> relied upon the following circumstances to find the accused guilty The presence of the appellant in the house wherein the alleged incident took place At the time of hearing the reference and the appeal the primary stand taken by the accused appellant was that the extra judicial confession relied upon by the prosecution is not correct There is no reason as to why they would falsely implicate the accused appellant by making an untruthful statement Though it was submitted by the accused appellant that even if the prosecution case was accepted in its totality there was no special reason to impose the death sentence He made a declaration of his act of abusing his wife and children The stand taken by the accused appellant before <ORG> was re iterated in this appeal AIR SC it was laid down that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy the following tests the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence There is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by <ORG> as far back as in The only other thing which needs consideration is whether death sentence as awarded by trial Court is proper Section prescribes death or life imprisonment as the penalty for murder The changes which the Code has undergone in the last three decades clearly indicate that <ORG> is taking note of contemporary criminological thought and movement There is another provision in the Code which also uses the significant expression special reason Section which is a new provision in the Code makes it mandatory for the court to record special reasons for not applying the provisions of Section Section thus casts a duty upon the court to apply the provisions of Section wherever it is possible to do so and to state special reasons if it does not do so Special reasons must have some relation to these factors Criminal justice deals with complex human problems and diverse human beings It should be borne in mind that before the amendment of Section of the old Code by the Criminal Procedure Code Amendment Act which came into force on on a conviction for an offence punishable with death if the court sentenced the accused to any punishment other than death the reason why sentence of death was not passed had to be stated in the judgment The court must however take into account all the circumstances and state its reasons for whichever of the two sentences it imposes in its discretion Likewise if others involved in the crime and similarly situated have received the benefit of life imprisonment or if the offence is only constructive being under Section read with Section or again the accused has acted suddenly under another instigation without premeditation perhaps the court may humanely opt for life even like where a just cause or real suspicion of wifely infidelity pushed the criminal into the crime In <NAME> case supra it has been observed that <ORG> para A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered a is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence and are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender Another decision which illuminatingly deals with the question of death sentence is <NAME> case supra In <NAME> case supra it was observed SCC para The following questions may be asked and answered as a test to determine the rarest of the rare case in which death sentence can be inflicted a Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender The following guidelines which emerge from <NAME> case supra will have to be applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposition of death sentence arises SCC para i The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime Death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness murder by hired assassin for money or reward or a cold blooded murder for gains of a person vis vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust or murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland A convict hovers between life and death when the question of gravity of the offence and award of adequate sentence comes up for consideration Award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to the rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties accusations are brought against the accused the prosecuted is given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence There is no specific plea taken in the present case about intoxicant having administered without appellant knowledge The brutal acts done by the accused appellant are diabolic in conception and cruel in execution Merely because he claims to be a drunk at the relevant point of time that does not in any way get diluted not because of what is provided in Section but because one after another five lives were taken and that too of four young children This case squarely falls under the rarest of rare category to warrant death sentence
