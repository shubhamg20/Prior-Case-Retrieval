Further it is argued that the compromise having been entered into as a settlement of certain claims to portions of the estate is binding on all who took part in it and their representatives and creates vested rights in favour of those whose rights are declared in it But as reliance is placed on the binding character of the registered documents under which it is claimed that plaintiffs and their male heirs have acquired a right to an hereditary annuity for all time I may observe that in so far as Exhibit A and provide that <NAME> and <NAME> and their male descendants have a vested right to recover the fixed allowances through the present <NAME> and after him through the rightful owners of the <NAME>i or their heirs assignees executors administrators trustees etc I would therefore dismiss these appeals with costs In these suits it is unnecessary to determine questions of priority between the various maintenance holders inter se seeing that their right to receive maintenance rests in the first instance not on their decrees or agreements but on their relationship to the owner of the Zamindari It was not contended nor could it be successfully contended that the maintenance formed such a charge on the Zamindari as would preclude the Zamindar for the time being from alienating portions of it for necessary purposes
