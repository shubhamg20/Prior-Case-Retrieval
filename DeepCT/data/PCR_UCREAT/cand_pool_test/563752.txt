These are two connected suits filed for a declaration that the assessments of sales tax made on the plaintiffs are illegal and void Against the said order the plaintiffs preferred an appeal of on the file of <ORG> Madras representing the price of goods exported outside India or sold locally on behalf of foreign principals Against that order the plaintiffs preferred an appeal to the Commercial Tax The Commercial Tax Officer North Madras in turn referred the plaintiffs to the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer by his order dated and eventually the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer passed an order on fixing the total turnover at Rs The plaintiffs preferred an appeal to the Commercial Tax Officer North Madras in App Are the sales of tea exported to foreign countries exempted from taxation as sales made outside the State On a review of the entire circumstances of the case I nave come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs are dealers as the term dealer will take in a commission agent also secondly the the sales in question were all effected within the State of Madras thirdly that the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim exemption from assessment under Section Clause of the Madras General Sales Tax Act whatever might be the position of the non resident foreign principals fourthly that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the deductions claimed under Rule of the Turnover and Assessment Rules and fifthly that the Madras General Sales Tax Act is not opposed to Article of the Constitution of India In Madras Mysore Travan core Cochin and Uttar Pradesli the term includes a person who carries on the business of purchasing goods If the supply of goods is for no consideration then it cannot come within the sales tax levy as there is no element of sale In all the definitions the following essential features are present i there must be a sale ii in the course of carrying on the business of selling goods AIR SC at In exercise of the legislative power conferred upon them in substantially similar terms by the Government of India Act <ORG> enacted sales tax laws for their resective Provinces acting on the principle of territorial nexus referred to above Whether a person carries on business or not is essentially a matter of inference When a commission agent sells goods belonging to his principal with his authority or consent ana without disclosing the name of the owner there is certainly a transfer of property in the goods from the commission agent to the buyer A business which consists in such transactions can properly be described as a business of selling goods Point The contention of the <ORG> is that these sales took place within the <ORG> of Madras When full amounts were drawn by surrendering documents of title specific goods were thus unconditionally appropriated to the contracts and the sales were completed in Madras This was done by means of an amendment of the General Sales tax Act Madras Act of and which has apparently come into force under Part IV of the Fort St In regard to rubber no decided case has been brought to my notice The use of the word horticulture in juxtaposition with the word agriculture cannot be construed to mean that the word agriculture is used in a narrow sense But the sale of agricultural or horticultural produce is exempt from the levy of sales tax in the hands of a grower of such produce or a person having an interest in the land in which the produce is grown See Section i Under Section of the Act sale of tea grown by the seller or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise is exempt from levy of sales tax on two conditions viz It is clear that to be a dealer for attracting taxability he must either be an owner of the goods or a person who has custody thereof with authority to transfer the property therein as in the case of a commission agent Then there are two classes of persons under the term seller of the tea growing his own produce But whatever be the class under which he falls as contended for by the State of Madras under Section exemption to sales tax for tea is limited to tea produced and sold by the resident estate owners and cannot be claimed in regard to tea produced out side the province by non resident estate owners and sold within the Province by their accredited representatives or agents but comes into the State himself and sells and delivers goods he is liable to tax because the sale has taken place in this State and the plea that there is no adequate machinery to levy and collect the tax from such a non resident is not relevant as the difficulty in collection is not a bar to making the assessment The agent is safeguarded by being authorised under the Act to retain out of any amount payable to the non resident an amount equal to the tax assessed on or paid by him in respect of the nonresident turnover So though initially the agent of a non resident principal is assessed on a turnover it is open to the non resident principal to make an application to the assessing authority and establish to his satisfaction that the produce assessed in the hands of the agent was agricultural produce grown by the principal himself or grown on any land in which such non resident principal has an interest and therefore exempt from assessment Secondly the commission agent is constituted as agent only for the purpose of selling and by a fiction of law he is treated as a dealer for a limited purpose i assessability on the first instance There is generally another type of contract called and contract It was held by this Court in an unreported case Commr It is quite true that these decisions of <ORG> as pointed out by Sri <NAME> on page of his Law of Sales tax in India have given rise to fresh problems such as where does a delivery take place how is consumption to be proved what happens in a case where delivery takes place in one State and consumption in another etc The suits are dismissed with costs
