The question that has arisen in this application for revision is whether a civil Court to which an issue has been sent by <ORG> for decision under Section Agra Tenancy Act and which has decided that issue ex parte has any jurisdiction to entertain an application for the setting aside of the ex parte decision and to decide the issue on its merits He has come to the conclusion that the civil Court has jurisdiction under the provisions of Section Civil and Order Schedule In this case their Lordships of <ORG> held that this section of the Civil Procedure Code or rather the equivalent section of the old Code had no application to execution proceedings so that there is no real analogy between that and the present case The issue with which we have to deal in the present case is a question of title and it goes to the very root of the suit which was before <ORG> It seems to me quite clear that it must be held to be a matter which originates in itself and not as one which springs from a suit or from other proceedings or arises in connection therewith There is nothing in the passages which I have quoted or to which I have been referred to show that an issue referred to a civil Court for decision by <ORG> is not such an original matter in the nature of a suit as is referred to in the judgment of their Lordships of <ORG> It is therefore dismissed with costs
