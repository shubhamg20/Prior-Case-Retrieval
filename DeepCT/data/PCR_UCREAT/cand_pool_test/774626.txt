The only question raised on this petition is whether the order was a lawful order within the meaning of Section of the Criminal Procedure Code The first is that the order does not state the material facts of the case as required by Sub section of the section and secondly the order is too wide and beyond the powers conferred by Sub section of Section of the Code It appears from the judgment of the learned District Magistrate that the order was promulgated to prevent a breach of the peace and rioting which the authorities apprehended on account of the sentences passed by <ORG> in what is now known as the Sholapur case That we think was a material fact which should have been stated in the order and we think that this part of the order as it stands is vague and does not comply with the requirements of Section of the Code A careful perusal of the language of Section of the Code shows that the power of a Magistrate under it is confined to the direction to a particular parson or persons to abstain from acts of a certain character or to the public generally to abstain from similar acts when frequenting or visiting a particular place Sub section of the section is an exception to the general rule that the order shall be directed to a particular person There is no power to direct the public generally simplicities A similar point arose in In re Belvi and we agree with the view there taken as to the scope of Section of the Code We are also of opinion that the order being addressed to the public generally must be limited under Section to the public when frequenting or visiting a particular place The order therefore is illegal and beyond the powers conferred upon the Magistrate under the section As far as I can see it is only under Sub section of Section that it is open to a Magistrate to rescind or alter any order made by him under the section But this means that he can rescind or alter an order previously made under the section In the result we set aside the conviction and sentence and direct the fine if paid to be refunded
