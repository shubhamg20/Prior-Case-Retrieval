In the middle of October however it came to the notice of the plaintiff when the wrapper of the defendant came to the hand of the plaintiff that the defendant has also started marketing its products of washing soaps hi quite similar wrappers and under the same trade mark BILLY as those of the plaintiff By the use of the wrapper of the plaintiff the defendant has since been passing off its inferior and sub standard goods as and for the quality goods of the plaintiff The other ground taken is that the use of trade mark BILLY and that of such wrapper are common in the trade of soaps and not only the defendant but so many other parties are using the trade mark BILLY along with the wrapper which is similar to that of the plaintiff and some of the parties referred to are i <ORG> Sunam Distt The question of jurisdiction of this court to try the suit has also been raised A the threshold I propose to deal with the question of jurisdiction of this court a prelim nary objection In addition to this the plaintiff has made an application before the Registrar of Trade Marks Delhi for registration of its trade mark BILLY and such an application has been accepted by the Registrar of Trade Marks by advertisement in <ORG> and the said mark is bound to be registered under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act In view of these facts that both the plaintiff and the defendant have been selling the goods within the territorial jurisdiction of Delhi this Court has jurisdiction to try this suit At this stage it is sufficient that the specific averment in the plaint whatever it may be worth has been made that the plaintiff and defendant are selling the goods within the territorial jurisdiction of Delhi Therefore in my opinion this court has territorial jurisdiction to try this suit In order to succeed in the injunction application three factors must be kept in view There is good deal of force in this argument of two competing wrappers gives the wrapper of defendant of overall effect of deceptive similarity which prima facie constitute infringement of copyright of the plaintiff The next question that arises for consideration at this stage is whether between the parties who has established the user of the trade mark and copyright at point of time irrespective of the ownership of such mark and copyright In this connection there is a statement filed by the plaintiff from A perusal of these documents clearly demonstrates that the plaintiff is selling the soap of trade mark BILLY with the distinctive artistic wrapper of BILLY from the year uptil now and continuing to sell the same under its trade mark and artistic wrapper It was next submitted by counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff has no right to use the trade mark BILLY and artistic wrapper as so many other parties who are referred to earlier were also using the same trade mark In this connection it is sufficient to say that under the law it is the right of two parties before the court which has to be determined and as already discussed the plaintiff being prior user has the better and legal right to seek relief from this court The use of the trade mark and artistic wrapper by the plaintiff much earlier to that of the defendant not only shows a prima facie case in plaintiff favor but balance of convenience also lies in its favor Furthermore if the defendant firm is not restrained by means of interim injunction it will continue to market its goods with the offending mark and wrapper with the result that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury I would therefore grant an injunction restraining the defendant during the pendency of the suit from manufacturing selling offering for sale or otherwise dealing in the washing soap under the impugned trade mark BILLY and artistic wrapper of the plaintiff or under any other trade mark and artistic wrapper which may be similar and or deceptively identical to the trade mark BILLY and artistic wrapper of the plaintiff and also from passing off its products of washing soap as and for the quality goods of the plaintiff under the trade mark BILLY and artistic wrappers which are quite similar and deceptively identical to the trades mark and artistic wrappers of the plaintiff
