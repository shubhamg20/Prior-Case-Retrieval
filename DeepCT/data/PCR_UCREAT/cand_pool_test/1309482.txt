Having taken cognizance of the offence he had to find out who the real offenders were and if he came to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some other persons were involved The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dismissing Criminal Revision No of filed by the appellant <NAME> On April the Sub divisional Magistrate passed the following order The appellant challenged this order before the Sessions Judge The Sessions Judge rejected the argument and held that it was open to the Magistrate to summon any person against whom he found sufficient evidence in the case The appellant then filed a criminal revision before <ORG> divisional Magistrate had discharged him On the first point <ORG> held that the order of the Magistrate did not result in a separate complaint case against the appellant as the present case was instituted when the sub divisional Magistrate took cognizance of an offence reported by the Police and therefore the case shall be deemed to have been instituted oft the police report <ORG> further observed that it is therefore clear from the language of section of the Code that the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence made out in the police report or in the petition of complaint and there is nothing like taking cognizance of the offenders at that stage On the facts of the instant case therefore cognizance of the offence has been taken on a police report and the order of the transferee Magistrate summoning <NAME> does not amount to taking cognizance of an offence The learned counsel for the appellant Mr <NAME> raises two points before us first that the discharge of the appellant by the order dated April by the Sub divisional Magistrate was final and secondly that the proper procedure to be observed on the facts of this case was not under A but under the subsequent sections in Chapter XVIII of the Criminal Procedure Code We see no force in these points There is no force in this contention because there cannot be any question of discharge when the appellant was not sent up upon the charge sheet submitted by the police He says that although cognizance might have been taken of an offence under no proceeding as such was instituted against the appellant at this stage the proceeding was instituted when a non bailable warrant was issued against the appellant and this proceeding was instituted not on the basis of a police report but on the basis of evidence taken before the Ma gistrate and therefore he says is a proceeding falling within Section i and of the Code read as follows Except as hereinafter provided any Presidency Magistrate District Magistrate or Sub divisional Magistrate and any other Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf may take cognizance of any offence a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge or suspicion that such offence has beer Under the three clauses of to which we have already referred criminal prosecution can be initiated i by a police officer by a report in writing ii upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon the Magistrate own knowledge or suspicion and iii upon receiving a complaint of facts We are thus concerned to find out whether the report of the police officer in writing in this case can be described as a complaint of facts or as information received from any person other than a police officer The term complaint in this connection has been defined by the Code of Criminal Procedure and it means the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under the Code that some person whether known or unknown has committed an offence but it does not include the report of a police officer It therefore follows that Criminal Procedure Code can only apply to those cases which are instituted otherwise than on a police report that is to say upon complaints which are not reports of a police officer or upon information received from persons other than a police officer But says Mr <NAME> that though it is true that cognizance was taken on April the cognizance was taken of the offence as far as the other accused were concerned and not as far is the appellant was concerned as a Matter of fact the appellant had been rightly or wrongly discharged in our opinion once cognizance has been taken by the Magistrate he takes cognizance of an offence and not the offenders once he takes cognizance of an offence it is his duty to find out who the offenders really are and once he comes to the Conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police Some other persons are involved it is his duty to proceed against those persons If a Magistrate takes cognizance under a on the basis of a complaint of facts he would take cognizance and a proceeding would be instituted even though persons who had committed the offence were not known at that time Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondent brought to our notice some decisions which have taken the same view
