The appellants have questioned the validity of the order passed by <ORG> rejecting the claim of the appellants that there was no agreement between the appellants and the respondent <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the respondent to refer the dispute between them to an Arbitrator The appellant No <ORG> Mills is a registered partnership firm and the appellant No hereinafter referred to as the appellant is the Managing Partner The respondent issued a notice inviting tenders for supply of steel bars of various diametres to the extent of Mt Thereafter some dispute arose between the parties and it appears that the respondent vide its letter dated rescinded and annulled the contract for the balance quantity of tonnes In the agreement which was entered into between the appellants and the respondent it was stated WHEREAS the Contractor has submitted tender for the work Supplying and stocking of Cold Twisted deformed Steel Bars Conforming to IS of various dias at any A Stores in Delhi New Delhi and the same has been acepted by the <ORG> on the terms and condition contained in the tender forms and conditions attached herewith in the letter of acceptance dated the NOW THIS DEED WITNESS AS UNDER That the terms and conditions contained in the tender form and conditions of the contract attached to this deed and also the letter of <ORG> dated the shall be binding between the parties Paragraph of the said tender form contains the arbitration clause saying that except where otherwise provided in the contract all question and disputes relating to the meaning of the specifications designs drawings and instructions hereinbefore mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship or materials used on the work or to any other question claim right matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to the contract designs drawings specifiation estimates instruction orders or these conditions or otherwise concerning the works or the executions on failure to execute the same whether arising during the progress of the work or after the completion or abandonment thereof shall be referred to the sole arbitration of the person appointed by the Engineer Member DDA at the time of dispute The stand of the appellants is that the said clause shall not be deemed to be a part of the agreement inasmuch as it is only part of the tender form which is issued to every contractor intending to supply materials to the respondent The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the expression Tender Form mentioned in the agreement does not refer to the aforesaid form relating to tender and contract for supply of materials in which there is an arbitration clause rather it refers to form No which had been filled up by the appellants saying that they had submitted their tender for supply to the respondent materials described therein within time specified subject to the conditions of the contract The form of tender in which clause contains condition regarding referring the disputes to the arbitration as well as the form No on which reliance has been placed on behalf of the appellants are attached to the agreement and as such both shall be deemed to be the part of the agreement Where there is no such agreement there is an initial want of jurisdiction Where there is an arbitration clause in a contract it amounts to two contracts into one one relating to the execution of the work entrusted in the manner prescribed and the other how to resolve the dispute in event any such dispute arises in respect of the said contract But it shall be deemed to be part of the agreement because the agreement specifically says that the terms and conditions contained in the tender form shall be binding between the parties which obviously will include clause of the tender form which admittedly requires any dispute between the parties to be referred to an arbitration The other special feature of the present case is that each page of the tender form which forms part of the agreement has been signed by the appellant on behalf of the firm and the Executive Engineer on behalf of the respondent The Arbitrator gets jurisdiction to decide the disputes on basis of the agreement to refer such disputes and not by its acceptance or denial The objection on behalf of the appellants that there was no condition in the main agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration can be accepted only if it is held that the different terms and conditions mentioned in the tender form are not binding on the parties because parties never agreed to those terms and conditions while entering into a contract But the fact about which there is no dispute is that both the parties had signed the tender form in token of having accepted the terms and conditions mentioned therein including about reference of disputes if any to an Arbitrator In this background it is difficult for us to comprehend as to how it can be held that the appellants had never agreed to refer any dispute arising between the parties to an Arbitrator in terms of Clause of the tender form
