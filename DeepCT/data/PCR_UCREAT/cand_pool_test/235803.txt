He admits that under Section a not just the items which have been specified in the Schedule but also an admixture of two or more such items or any of those items in a processed form would also be included It was contended that hides and skins whether tanned or untanned constituted one commodity and therefore there could be no tax on sales of hides and skins in raw condition when there was no tax on sale of hides and skins in tanned condition It was held that flour maida or suji were not included in the Act and they would not fall within the term Wheat as defined in the Act It was held that even though the basic character of the mango pulp and apple concentrate may be present in beverages but the end products were not fruits which were specified in the Schedule The <ORG> held that for manufacture something more was necessary and that there must be a transformation and a new and distinct article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use Tanned leather retains its basic character namely it remains hide or skin though there is some change in form and physical appearance Lastly reliance was placed upon the case of <ORG> and another etc It was held that the word manufacture is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance In our view this authority would also show that in fact there is no manufacture but mere processing of hides and skins to bring them into a tanned state As against this Mr <NAME> submitted that definitions and meanings given in other Acts or in the context of other Acts can be of no assistance He submits that one has to look at the provisions of the said Act itself He submits that any item would be an agricultural produce if it is specified in the Schedule or if it is an admixture of two or more items specified in the Schedule or if it is a processed form of any of the items specified in the Schedule He admits that if there was a conflict between an Hindi version and an English version then by virtue of Article of the Constitution of India the English version would prevail He submits that if there is no conflict then the Hindi version can be looked at in order to determine any ambiguity or to find out if any item is included or not It was held that it was an indisputable canon of construction that where an expression is defined in the statute unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context the expression had to be construed as having the same meaning assigned to it in the dictionary clause of the statute Reverting however to the heading under which legumes are enumerated in notification it must be confessed that it clearly connotes the meaning to be given to the whole grain and denotes dal i split folds as specified agricultural produce This contention was negatived and it was held that khandsari was a genus and khandsari sugar was a species and in the market both were merely known as khandsari This <ORG> held that a wide interpretation had to be given to Section a of the said Act as the meaning was exhaustive and not restricted to the items included in the Schedule It was held that items which came into being in a processed form would be included The Dictionary of Leather Terminology published by <ORG> describes leather as the hide and skin of any animal or any portion of such skin when tanned tawed or otherwise dressed for use This as we have seen represents the stage when they undergo the process of finishing and assume a form in which they can be readily utilised for manufacture of various commercial articles He submitted that cases relied upon by the Appellants were of no help as all of them were under taxing statutes and were merely interpreting terms in the context of the definitions given in those statutes We have considered the arguments of both the parties In our view it is clear that the interpretation has to be on the basis of the expression Agricultural produce as set out in Section a of the said Act All the cases relied upon by Mr <NAME> are cases under the taxing statutes where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms as defined in those statutes A perusal of Section a of the said Act makes it clear that an agricultural product would be a product which is specified in the Schedule or one which is admixture of two or more items and would also include any such item in a processed form In our view it makes no difference for the purposes of the said Act that the concerned item is a different commodity from the one which is included in the Schedule We see no reason to go into the difference between manufacturing and processing For this reason we are of the opinion that there is no illegality or infirmity in the judgment of <ORG> Undoubtedly if there is conflict between the two than the English version would prevail However if there is no conflict then one can always have assistance of the Hindi version in order to find out whether the word used in English includes a particular item or not
