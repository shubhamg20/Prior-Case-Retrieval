This is an appeal from a judgment of <ORG> at Calcutta delivered on a reference made to it under Section of the Indian Income tax Act XI of The reference arose out of an assessment to income tax upon the respondents for the year in respect of an item of Rs The respondents carry on business in Calcutta as merchants and agents of various companies and have branch offices in different parts of India as full compensation for cessation of the agency and in August of the same year <ORG> paid them another sum of Rs The income tax officer in computing the assessable income of the respondents for the relevant year took these two receipts into account as profits or gains of their business in the year ending December but allowed certain deductions therefrom in respect of compensation paid by the respondents to various employees leaving a balance of Rs He thought that if the respondents could not escape by reason of the contention raised by this question they must fail he had nothing to add to what was then said on these points whether these sums are income profits or gains within the meaning of the Act at all and for the reasons stated in his judgment he came to the conclusion that they were not In one part of his judgment the Chief Justice seems to hold that the compensation for loss of these agencies is a receipt in respect of a capital asset in the nature of goodwill but it has been objected with some force that there is nothing upon which this finding can be based There was so far as the facts disclose no transfer of the goodwill of the respondents and no agreement by them not to compete with the new selling agency of the companies But here again their Lordships think that there are no facts to support such a conclusion and they doubt if Section of the Indian Contract Act upon which reliance is placed has any application It is contended for the appellant that the business of the respondent did in fact go on throughout the year and this is no doubt true in a sense They had other independent commercial interests which they continued to pursue and the profits of which have been taxed in the ordinary course without objection on their part No objection has been taken to the form of the answer or to its sufficiency and it would seem unnecessary therefore to deal with the other two questions Their Lordships will only add that the reasoning of this judgment would apply equally if the appellant based his claim on head vi other sources and the Corresponding provisions of Section Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal should be dismissed with costs
