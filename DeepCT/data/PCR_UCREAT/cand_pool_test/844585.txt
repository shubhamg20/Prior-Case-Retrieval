It is the petitioner case that the customs authorities were duty bound to make the endorsement of the export and they had no jurisdiction to question the valuation of the goods It was also held that the goods were liable for confiscation under Section of the <ORG> Act hereinafter referred to as the Act read with Clause of the Export Control Order and Sections and of the Foreign Trade Development and Regulation Act Liberty was given to the writ petitioner respondent to file a supplementary affidavit annexing the order of adjudication as well as setting out grounds of challenge to the order of the Commissioner of <ORG> as he might be advised When the hearing was resumed it was conceded by the <ORG> Authorities that the order of the Commissioner could not be sustained and that it should be set aside and remanded back for re adjudication after observing the principles of natural justice and in accordance with law Besides the issue involved is basic to the assumption of jurisdiction by the <ORG> Authorities and since there is no clear judicial authority on the point it is appropriate that this <ORG> should itself determine the cause on the merits Section provides inter alia that for the purposes of Customs Tariff Act or any other law for the time being in force whereunder a duty of customs is chargeable on any goods by reference to their value the value of such goods shall be deemed to be a price at which such or like goods are ordinarily sold or offered for sale for delivery at the time and place of importation or exportation as the case may be in the course of international trade where the seller and the buyer have no interest in the business of each other and the price is the sole consideration for the sale or offer for sale Under Section of the Act duty of customs are leviable on all goods imported into or exported from India except as otherwise provided in the Act itself or in any other law for the time being in force On th May in exercise of powers conferred by Sub section of Section of the Act <ORG> published a notification being Notification No Cus dated exempting materials imported into India against a value based advance licence issued in terms of Para of the Export and Import Policy from the whole of the customs duty leviable thereon and from the whole of the additional duty leviable thereon subject to diverse conditions including i that the materials imported are covered by a Value Based Duty Exemption Entitlement Certificate hereinafter referred to as the said certificate issued by <ORG> in the form specified in the Schedule annexed to this notification that the export obligation is discharged within the period specified in the said certificate or within such extended period as may be granted by <ORG> by exporting goods manufactured in India vi where benefit of the notification is sought by a person other than licencee such benefit shall be allowed against the said licence and the said certificate only if it bears endorsement of transferability by <ORG> Part II in turn consists of nine parts namely Parts A to I We are concerned particularly with Part which requires the diverse particulars of exports to be entered into the certificate including the FOB value of the product in Rupees and US Dollars Whereas by any Central Act or Regulation a power to issue any notification order scheme rule form or bye law is conferred then expressions used in the notification order scheme rule form or bye law if it is made after the commencement of this Act shall unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context have the same respective meanings as in the Act or regulation conferring the power emphasis supplied As the <ORG> scheme in fact incorporates the exemptions granted under Section of the Act the value must be determined with reference to the definition of the word in the Act itself Similarly under the Foreign Trade Regulation Rules which have been framed under the Foreign Trade Development and Regulation Act Rule i provides that value would have the same meaning as was assigned to it in Section of the Act Thus the procedure for determination of value under Section of the Act is brought in for the purposes of the Rules Rule of the Rules clearly states that the value of the goods must be stated whether the goods are liable to duty or not and such statement must be certified as being correct If an incorrect declaration of the value is made this would violate Section of the Act which forbids the export or import of goods in violation of the Rules This in turn would attract the provisions of Sections and of the Act as goods imported or exported contrary to law and give <ORG> the power to investigate the correct value of the goods in question and for that purpose utilise the method prescribed under Section Under Section of the Act the restriction imposed by inter alia Section shall be determined to have been imposed under Section of the Customs Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly For the purposes of ascertaining such correct value the <ORG> are required to follow the mode prescribed in Section of the Act
