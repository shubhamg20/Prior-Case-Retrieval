This appeal is brought from an order of <NAME> dated June whereby certain proceedings commenced by a notice or a letter issued by the Additional Collector of <ORG> dated September were quashed by a writ in the nature of certiorari and a mandamus issued directing the <ORG> authorities not to give effect to the notice The respondents <NAME> and others are a firm carrying on business under the name and style of <ORG> of importing betelnuts from eastern countries The firm had entered into an agreement with <ORG> of Penang for supply of bags of betelnuts the total value of which was Rs The appellants contention appearing from the notice seems to be that since the Bill of Entry had been presented to the <ORG> House on the rd May and the goods were submerged in the fiver sometime thereafter the <ORG> were entitled to retain the full amount of duty consequently the order of refund made in favour of the respondent firm had been irregular In this communication the firm denied that liability to pay duty on account of the entire consignment even though part of it was shortlanded was part of the ordinary trade risks In substance the respondents contention was that the <ORG> authorities had no jurisdiction to re open the matter in the circumstances that had happened Accordingly the respondent firm applied to this Court under Article of the Constitution and a Rule Nisi was issued by <ORG> on December requiring the customs authorities to show cause why they should not cancel or withdraw their notice dated the th day of September and the subsequent notices and forbear from giving effect to them After hearing the parties <NAME> <NAME> made the Rule absolute and issued a writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the letter or notice in question and all proceedings based upon it and another writ in the nature of mandamus directing the <ORG> authorities not to give effect to the notice Being dissatisfied with the decision of the learned trial Judge the appellants have preferred this appeal In order to be able to appreciate this contention it would be necessary to notice the two sections When customs duties or charges have not been levied or have been short levied through inadvertence error collusion or misconstruction on tile part of the officers of <ORG> or through mis statement as to real value quantity or description on the part of the owner or when any such duty or charge after having been levied has been owing to any such cause erroneously refunded the person chargeable with the duty or charge which has not been levied or which has been so short levied or to whom such refund has erroneously been made shall pay the duty or charge or the deficiency or repay the amount paid to him in excess on a notice of demand being issued to him within three months from the relevant date as defined in Sub section and the <ORG> Collector may refuse to pass any goods belonging to such person until the said duties or charges or the said deficiency or excess be paid or repaid For the purpose of Sub section the expression relevant date means a in a case where the duty or charge has not been levied the date on which the <ORG> officer makes an order for clearance of the goods in a case where the duty is reassessed under Section A the date of reassessment in a case where the duty is provisionally assessed under Section the date of final adjustment of duty in a case where the duty or charge has been erroneously refunded the date of refund and in any other case the date of the first assessment <ORG> authority may of its own motion or otherwise call for and examine the record of any proceeding in which an officer of <ORG> has passed any decision Or order under this Act for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any such decision or order and may pass such order thereon as it thinks fit Provided that no order prejudicial to any person shall be passed under this Section unless such person has been given a reasonable opportunity of making a representation against the proposed order The powers conferred upon the Chief <ORG> authority under Sub section may also in the like manner and subject to the like conditions be exercised by the Chief <ORG> officer in respect of any decision or order passed under this Act by any officer of <ORG> subordinate to him It is to be observed that Section occurs in Chapter which deals with the levy of and exemption from <ORG> duties Section A occurs in Chapter XVII which prescribes the procedure relating to offences and appeals The power of holding search on suspicion power to screen or ray bodies of persons in order to detect secreted good power of the officers of <ORG> to summon persons to give evidence and produce documents power to issue search warrants power to seize things liable to confiscation power to hold adjudication proceedings for confiscation and imposition of penalties enforcement of obligations created by the Act and punishment for dereliction of statutory duties and for commission of offences are amongst the various matters provided for in the Chapter It seems plain that whereas Chapter of the Act deals with rights and liabilities Chapter XVII deals with procedure It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that Section A is an independent provision which must receive full effect and cannot in any way be subordinated to any thing contained in Section The respondents contention has clearly been that in view of the provision contained in Section they cannot be asked to return any part of the duty which was refunded to them after the expiry of three months from the date of refund The contention is that even if this amount was erroneously refunded to them no proceedings can be taken for recovery of the amount unless they were commenced by a notice of demand issued in terms of Section within a period of three months from the date of refund In this case the notice by which the respondent firm were called upon to show cause against the proposed order of repayment of the amount refunded was clearly time barred The proceeding commenced or intended to be commenced by the notice dated the th September was a proceeding in revision in terms of Section A which is a complete code in itself and under which any order could be revised within a period of two years We find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken of the matter by the learned Judge It seems plain that Section A would be nearly void of content if the substantive provisions in the Act were to be read completely divorced from it It gives wide powers to the <ORG> authority to call for and examine the records of any proceeding for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order made by a subordinate officer of the <ORG> But where however in consequence of such revisional proceeding any order is likely to be made which may prove prejudicial to any person the Section provides that no such order can be made adverse to that person unless reasonable opportunity has been given to the person concerned of making a representation against the proposed order It may well be that a person aggrieved may apply to the <ORG> authority for relief under Section A in a given case and if he so applies the <ORG> authority would be quite entitled to give him relief provided there is no bar to the grant of such relief In this case the <ORG> authority could certainly ask for repayment of an amount erroneously refunded provided the notice of demand wag issued within the period of three months prescribed in Section Similarly under Section of the Act which speaks of refund of charges overpaid to the <ORG> no relief can be granted to the person concerned unless the application is made within a period of three months That power can be exercised within a period of two years but in a case like the one before us which is completely covered by the specific provision contained in Section of the Act it cannot be said that the limit of time prescribed in the Section is wiped out or superseded by the period of limitation prescribed in Section A In our view it is idle to contend that since Section A prescribes a period of two years within which the revisional powers of the <ORG> authority may be exercised that has the effect of destroying the provision of Section which is a clear and specific provision in the same Statute It seems clear that when <ORG> duty after having been levied has been erroneously refunded owing to one or other of the causes mentioned in Section the person to whom such refund has been erroneously made shall repay the amount on a notice of demand being issued to him within three months from the date of refund The <ORG> right to levy duty unpaid or short paid or the citizen right to refund of duty erroneously paid or overpaid have been placed on the same footing The question then arises whether by recourse to Section A the time for levying of duty not paid or under paid or erroneously refunded can be enlarged in favour of the <ORG> authorities The direct effect of such enlargement of time will be to destroy completely the earlier provision contained in Section limiting the time for the <ORG> to claim payment of duty not levied or short levied or erroneously refunded In our view there is no real conflict between Section and Section A and even if there was one it would be the business of the <ORG> to harmonise the two provisions so as to provide a workable and well reasoned basis on which each might fulfil its purpose in aid of the object of the enactment The very amplitude of power given by the Section would be a reason to guard against its abuse and we consider an attempt to enlarge time for claim to payment of duty not levied or short levied or erroneously refunded by appealing to its provisions would be an instance of such abuse The Section cannot be read so as to destroy or defeat the earlier express provision contained in Section of the Act The rule is well known that where a general intention is expressed and the Act expresses also a particular intention incompatible with the general intention the particular intention is to be considered in the nature of an exception In our opinion the specific provision relating to limitation contained in Section cannot possibly be destroyed or over riden by the provision in Section A whereby the <ORG> authority has been given power to revise orders previously made within a period of two years There can in our view be no question that the period of limitation prescribed in Section must prevail According to the notice issued by the <ORG> authorities a part of the duty was erroneously refunded Consequently if action was to be taken it was required to be taken under Section within the period of three months prescribed in the Section itself That expression is defined and it means in this instance the date of refund We cannot accept the contention that since the notice speaks of action proposed to be taken in terms of Section A the period of limitation prescribed in Section of the Act is wiped out to the detriment of the person called upon to show cause against the proposed recovery of the amount said to have been erroneously refunded There can be no question that different periods of limitation have been prescribed for different purposes In order to enable the Chief <ORG> authority to exercise a general power of superintendence over decisions and orders made by subordinate officers of the <ORG> a longer period of limitation has been prescribed This is quite understandable but surely the period of limitation in Section A cannot override the express provision in Section which limits the issue of notice of demand for payment of duties not levied or short levied or erroneously refunded to a period of three months It was then argued on behalf of the appellants that the proceedings under Article of the Constitution were premature If the <ORG> authorities had jurisdiction to issue the notice requiring the person concerned to show cause against the proposed confiscation of the fluorescent tubes and accessories then surely an application under Article at that stage would be premature Where therefore there is that initial want of jurisdiction to commence a proceeding there can in our view be no reason whatever why the person proceeded against should be prevented from seeking the assistance of the <ORG> under Article of the Constitution for the purpose of preventing harassment to himself That section as we have indicated prescribes a definite period of time within which the notice of demand for recovery of duty not levied short levied or erroneously refunded has to be issued If on the face of things such notice was not issued in time surely the person affected has a right to seek the <ORG> assistance for the purpose of stopping a proceeding which is bound to be infructuous and abortive We do not think therefore that this objection to the application under Article being premature has any substance We have not been able to accept them and we must hold in agreement with the learned trial Judge that the notice to show cause by which the proceedings were commenced or about to be commenced must be quashed and the appellants directed not to give effect to the same It is clear that Section is a substantive provision which creates certain rights in favour of the <ORG> authorities to recover customs duties and charges and it clearly imposes liability to pay such duties and charges on persons liable to pay the same But it also prescribes a period of limitation within which the payment is to be demanded The condition precedent to the accrual of liability to pay is that the <ORG> authorities must issue a notice of demand to the person liable to pay within three months from the relevant date as defined or explained in Sub section of Section of the Sea <ORG> Act If no such notice of demand is issued within the prescribed period the amount of claim becomes irrecoverable The other point raised on behalf of the appellant is that the application under Article of the Constitution is not maintainable as it is a premature one It is submitted that unless an adjudication is made or until the order is revised the respondents have no grievance or cause of action Mere notice to show cause does not impose any liability to repay nor does it furnish any cause of action The respondents have acquired a valuable right to retain an amount refunded by reason of lapse of time There is no jurisdiction in the <ORG> authorities to re open a claim barred by limitation by having recourse to Section A I therefore agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs as proposed by my Lord
