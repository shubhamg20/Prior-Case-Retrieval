Under the provisions of Section of the Industrial Disputes Act hereinafter referred to as the Act the power to make a reference has been given to the State Government After the present petition had been filed in this Court the State Government issued in an Extraordinary Issue of <ORG> dated th August a corrigendum stating that instead of and > and be read in the Hindi Notification dated th May This case originally came up before me when two submissions were made on behalf of the petitioner They were as follows The Deputy Labour Commissioner had no jurisdiction to make the reference because the English version of the Notification alone to the exclusion of the Hindi one could be looked into under the law but inasmuch as the English version had not been properly authenticated and had not been published under the authority of the Governor that too could not be looked into That the Hindi Notification cannot support the case for delegation as there is in fact no delegation of power under Section of the Act in that Notification English would be deemed to be the authoritative text provided on the face of it it appears to have been issued under the authority of the Governor <ORG> was placed on this case before me As I considered that the case required reconsideration I referred the matter to a larger Bench and now the case has come up before us in the Full Bench Mr <NAME> who has appeared for the petitioner has confined himself to the two submissions that were made before me while sitting singly without adding any other In Ch I of that part there are two Articles i and In Ch II of this part there are three Articles Article reads as follows Subject to the provisions of Articles and <ORG> may by Jaw adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State or Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the official purposes of that State Provided that until <ORG> otherwise provides by law the English language shall continue to be used for those official purposes within the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of this Constitution Article reads as follows Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this part until <ORG> by law otherwise provides a all proceedings in <ORG> and in every High Court the authoritative texts i of all Bills to be introduced or amendments thereto to be moved in either <ORG> or in the <ORG> or either <ORG> of the Legislature of a State ii of all Acts passed by <ORG> or the Legislature of a State and of all Ordinances promulgated by the President or the Governor or Rajpramukh of a State and iii of all Orders rules regulations and bye laws issued under this Constitution or under any law made by <ORG> or <ORG> State shall be in the English language Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause a of Clause the Governor or Rajpramukh of a <ORG> may with the previous consent of the President authorise the use of the Hindi language or any other language used for any official purposes of the <ORG> in proceedings in <ORG> having its principal seat in that <ORG> Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to any judgment decree or order passed or made by such High Court Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the Legislature of a State has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor or Rajprarmikh of the State or in any order rule regulation or bye law deferred to in para iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor or Rajpramukh of the State in the Official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this article We are not concerned with Article in this case nor are we concerned with the provisions of Articles A and which occur in Ch IV of Part XVII of the Constitution The petitioner case is that the provisions of Article are mandatory and paras ii and iii of Clause of that Article requires that the authoritative text of all Acts passed by the <ORG> or the <ORG> of a State and of all Ordinances promulgated by the President or the Governor of a State and of all orders rules regulations and bye laws issued under the Constitution or under any law made by the <ORG> of a State shall be in English language It is contended that the effect of Articles and read together is that whereas it was open to <ORG> to prescribe Hindi as the language in which Bills or Acts were to be passed by the <ORG> or Ordinances promulgated by the Governor or orders rules regulations or bye laws framed a translation of these in English had got to be made under the authority of the Governor and published in <ORG> and that it was only such translation in English which was the authoritative text of the Bill Act Ordinance Order Rule Regulation or Bye law as the case may be In support of this submission learned counsel placed reliance upon the case of All LJ It is true that para iii of Clause of Article provides that all orders rules regulations and bye laws issued under the Constitution of under any law made by the <ORG> or the <ORG> of a State shall be in the English language But these provisions are subject to what is contained in Clause of this Article It is therefore clear that Clause will not be governed by Sub clause of Clause and the two have got to be read in a manner so as to give full scope to what is contained in Clause of this Article The substance of Clause is that if <ORG> his prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the Legislature of the State or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the State or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in para iii of Sub clause of Clause a translation of the same in the English language shall be published under the authority of the Governor in the official <ORG> and the said translation shall be deemed to be the authoritative text in the English language Mr <NAME> has contended that if it be held that even the Hindi Act after assent has a legal existence then there will be two Acts in respect of the same matter i the Hindi Act as passed by the <ORG> and assented to by the Governor and its English translation published under the authority of the Governor under Clause of Article of the Constitution The correct position is that of the same Act there are two versions one is the Hindi version and the other the English one All that in my judgment Article ii and iii requires is that when two such versions are brought on the Statute Book the English translation will be deemed to be the authoritative text if there is a conflict between the two versions which normally there should not be Inasmuch as it has been left under Article to the high authority of the Governor to have a translation prepared the chances of the translation not being faithful to the original Act are extremely remote It is not necessary for me to explore the reasons which led <ORG> to make such a provision but the most obvious one appears to be that India was going to be a federation of States in which different languages were used and it was necessary to have one common language for all India and inter State purposes both for reasons of national unity as also of convenience Un like Canada where Acts of Parliament and the legislature of Quebec are passed in English as also in the regional language French and both are authoritative we in India decided to follow the Irish example to some extent where Acts are passed in the Irish or English language but are translated into English or the Irish language in whichever they are not Originally passed by virtue of Section of the Constitution of Ireland If there was no provision for an English translation and its being treated as an authoritative text there would be difficulty both in <ORG> as also in <ORG> because Bills Acts Ordinances etc There is no competition between the two That is the view expressed by a Bench of <ORG> in AIR All on a comparison of the two versions and we are in agreement with it For these reasons with the greatest respect to the learned Judges who decided the case I am unable to agree with the decision in the case of All LJ There is another way of looking at the matter All that it provides is that the authoritative texts of all the Bills Acts Ordinances orders rules regulations and bye laws shall be in the English language subject of course to what is contained in Clause of that Article Therefore there is no impediment in the way of the State <ORG> in passing laws in Hindi so long as an English translation is made and published in <ORG> under the authority of the Governor <ORG> expressed an opinion that if there is a conflict between the English and the The other learned Judge who constituted the Bench ex pressed no such opinion The case went up in appeal to <ORG> and their Lordships there also did not express any opinion on this question For the reasons mentioned above rejecting the submission made by Sri <NAME> I hold that both the Hindi notification as also the English one in the present case can be looked into and that it is only in a case of conflict that the English notification may supersede the Hindi one This brings me to the consideration of another question whether the notification has been authenticated in the manner provided by the rules and has been published under the authority of the Governor in the State Gazette Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the Governor and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the Governor The Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the State and for the allocation among Ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion All orders or instruments made or executed by order or on behalf of the Government of the United Provinces shall be expressed to be made by or by order of the Governor of the United Provinces It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the notification dated the th of May does not show that it had been authenticated in the manner required by Article of the Constitution The question that requires consideration is as to whether the effect of reading this recital along with the concluding portions of the notification By order <NAME> The words By order occurring before the signatures of Sri <NAME> Secretary show that the notification was being issued under orders of the Governor The order was challenged on the ground that it did not say that the Governor of Bombay is pleased to direct and thus the order did not fulfil the requirements of Article of the Constitution Their Lordships observed as follows Now we do not wish to encourage laxity of expression nor do we mean to suggest that ingenious experiments regarding the permissible limits of departure from the language of a Statute or of the Constitution will be worthwhile but when all is said and done we must look to the substance of Article and of the order The short answer in this case is that the order under consideration is expressed to be made in the name of the Governor because it says By order of the Governor One of the meanings of expressed is to make known the opinions or the feelings of a particular person and when a Secretary to Government apprehends of man and tells him in the order that this is being done under the orders of the Governor he is in substance saying that he is acting in the name of the Governor and on his behalf is making known to the detenu the opinion and feelings and orders of the Governor It these words were there the matter would have been placed beyond controversy One of the questions that were raised before their Lordship was that the show cause notice issued to Mr <NAME> under Article of the Constitution had not been authenticated in the manner required by In the present case there can be no manner of doubt that the notice sent by the Chief Secretary of the State and expressed to be on behalf of the Government and giving opportunity to the petitioner to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against him was in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Article As a second string to his bow Mr <NAME> submitted that even though it be held that the Notification had been authenticated as required by Article of the Constitution it suffers from the defect that it had not been published under the authority of the Governor as required under Clause of Article of the Constitution In fact the decision of their Lordships of <ORG> in the case of FJR AIR SC completely demolishes the assumption that the Notification must on the face of it disclose that it was published under the authority of the Governor as the following observations in that judgment would show The fact that in the notification which is made thereafter to publish the order the formation of the opinion is not recited will not take away the power to make the order which had already arisen and led to the making of the order In the present case in addition to the initial presumption there are the clear words By authority which indicate that the notification was being published under the authority of the Governor Lastly it was urged that there is nothing to show that the Secretary had the authority to sign or issue the notification on behalf of the Governor Consequently there is no justification for the Submission that unless a notification on the face of it shows that it had been published under the authority of the Governor it has no legal validity However by means of a corrigendum the mistake was corrected and was to be read as It is therefore not possible to hold that there was no delegation by <ORG> in respect of powers contemplated by Section of the Act For these reasons I reject the submission of <NAME> that there was no delegation in fact of powers under Section of the Act in the Hindi notification It may however be stated that even if that were so no such mistake was committed in the English Notification and therein it was clearly notified that the State Government exercising powers under Section A of the Act had delegated their powers under Section to the Labour Commissioner and the Deputy Labour Commissioner For these reasons it cannot be said that powers under Section had not been delegated to the Deputy Labour Commissioner and he could not have made the reference giving rise to this writ petition The result is that both the submissions made by the learned counsel are rejected I would therefore dismiss the petition with costs on parties I agree with my brother <NAME> and have nothing to add I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother <NAME> and I entirely agree with the views expressed by him Clause of Article is an exception to Sub clause above in as much as i it recognises the use of the language prescribed by <ORG> for Bills or Acts or Ordinances or subordinate legislation ii it requires a translation of the same in the English language to be published under the authority of the Governor in the Official Gazette of the State and iii it deems the translation to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language Article which relates to official language or languages of a State has been made subject to Articles and but not to Article and it seems it was so done because a protection was given to the official language of the Bills Acts and subordinate legislation under Clause of Article The two provisions read together can only mean that the <ORG> of a State has the power to prescribe the language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> of the State or any Ordinances promulgated by the Governor or in any subordinate legislation and the only requirement is that a translation of the same in the English language is to be published under the authority of the Governor in the Official Gazette of the State can only mean that the notification was issued under the authority of the Governor and was properly authenticated within the meaning of Article read with rules of business which have also a statutory force It is sufficient if the notification is issued By Order and is properly authenticated The petition is dismissed with costs on parties
