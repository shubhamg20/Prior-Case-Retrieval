to the District Magistrate and in appeal were rightly set aside by <ORG> It observed however that a right of appeal Linder A <ORG> against the order of the <ORG> issued under the order of <ORG> was a futile formality and served no useful purpose <ORG> intimated by a letter written by the Additional District Magistrate Rajkot that the application filed by the respondents could not be granted An appeal filed against the order communicated through the Additional District Magistrate to the State Government was rejected and the respondents were asked not to make any further representations in that behalf The respondents then filed a petition in <ORG> for a declaration that sub of the Constitution and for a direction calling upon the Government of the State of Gujarat to grant no objection

purpose It is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to express any opinion on the propriety or validity of provisions making exercise of From the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> it appears that the only grounds of objection to the grant of the no objection certificate was that contrary to the terms of the respondents had constructed the annexe before <ORG> considered their application for a no objection certificate The third is <ORG> who under read with ss and has the power to issue a licence under the Act It is clear that the authority did not apply its mind to the application The authority which made the order on behalf of <ORG> appears to have been oblivious of the circumstances in which the building was constructed It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that under in Chapter <ORG> has absolute discretion to grant permission for the issue of a no objection certificate to the applicant Granting that <ORG> may validly control the exercise of power by <ORG> on that question we express no opinion <ORG> cannot relying upon the Rules assume to itself the jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue the licence Again the power to grant a licence under the Act is quasi judicial and by the use of the expression absolute discretion it is not intended to invest <ORG> with arbitrary power so as to destroy the limitations to which it is subject by its inherent nature It is clear on a perusal of the record that <ORG> did not correctly apprise itself of the facts when it gave its directions to <ORG> to dismiss the application and <ORG> also acted in violation of the rules which inhere the exercise of judicial power when it dismissed the appeal without giving reasons The orders dated July and August were rightly set aside by <ORG>
