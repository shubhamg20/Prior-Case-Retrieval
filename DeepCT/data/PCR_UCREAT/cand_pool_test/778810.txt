The <ORG> shall take action against the investigating police for collusive dilatoriness and deviousness The lawyers so designated shall be bound to make periodical visits and record and report to the concerned courts results which have relevance to legal grievances Where injustice verging on inhumanity emerges from hacking human rights guaranteed in Part III and the victim beseeches the <ORG> to intervene and relieve the <ORG> will be a functional futility as a constitutional instrumentality if it does not go into action until the wrong is righted Affirmed in unmistakables terms that the court has jurisdiction under Art There is a warrant for this vigil A prisoner wears the armour of basic freedom even behind bars and that on breach thereof by lawless officials the law will respond to his distress signals through writ aid The Indian human has a constant companion the court armed with the Constitution Implicit in the power to deprive the sentence of his personal liberty the <ORG> has to ensure that no more and no less than is warranted by the sentence happens The court has power and responsibility to intervene and protect the prisoner against mayhem crude or subtle and may use habeas corpus for enforcing in prison humanism and forbiddance of harsher restraints and heavier severities than the sentence carries There is therefore need to get ready a Prisoners Handbook in the regional language and make them freely available to the inmates Pressing need for prison reform and provision for adequate facilities to prisoners to enable them not only to be acquainted with their legal riots but also to record their complaints and grievances and to have confidential interviews periodically with lawyers nominated for the purpose by the District Magistrate or the court having jurisdiction There are some traces of attempts to hush up tho crime where the higher officers have not been that innocent These observations are not impressionistic but we leave it at that since our primary purpose is to protect the person of the prisoner not to prosecute the offender There are other aspects of the torture which demand deeper probe and panacea It may also be submitted that to check smuggling of narcotic drugs against prisoners who indulge in such activities cases of narcotic offences were get registered against the prisoners with <ORG> during this year That prisoners were transferred from the jail to Haryana due to administrative reasons which include indiscipline and violation of jail regulations by them and otherwise derogatory behaviour during the last year To aggravate the malady we have the fact that a substantial number of the prisoners are under trials who have to face their case in court and are presumably innocent until convicted There was nothing in the author view which money could not buy within the recesses of the prison campus There was a money order and mail service that perhaps was more dependable than what the postal department could offer For instance when a prisoner in my ward wanted two hundred rupees he sent a note through a warder to his people in old Delhi and in less than twenty four hours he had the money There was never a dispute there has to be the proverbial honour among thieves Such is the view expressed by many legal writers In American Jurisprudence there is a pregnant observation The writ is not and never has been a static narrow formalistic remedy A prisoner is entitled to the writ of habeas corpus when though lawfully in custody he is deprived of some right to which he is lawfully entitled even in his confinement the deprivation of which serves to make his imprisonment more burdensome than the law allows or curtails his liberty to a greater extent than the law permits In <NAME> <NAME> these two questions fell for decision and the court exercised jurisdiction even in such an internal matter Incidentally and interestingly there is reference to some States in the United States experimenting with programmes of allowing senior law students to service the penitentiaries At a later stage when we concretise definite directives we may have occasion to refer to the use of senior law students for rendering legal aid to prisoners and so it is worthwhile extracting a passage from <NAME> <NAME> supra with reference to <ORG> The experience at Leavenworth has shown that there have been very few attacks upon the prison administra tion that prospective frivolous litigation has been screened out and that where the law school felt the prisoner had a good cause of action relief was granted in a great percentage of cases Even where there has been no tangible success the fact that the inmate had someone on the outside listen to him and analyse his problems had a most beneficial effect Incidentally the presence of law students at the elbow of the prisoner has a preventive effect on ward and warden What prison reform perspectives and strategies should be adopted to strengthen in the long run the constitutional mandates and human rights imperatives The canvas was spread wide by counsel and court and we deal with the arguments within the larger spread out of the case The jurisdictional dimension is lucently laid down by <NAME> in <NAME> case This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and it ex facie confers a wide power on <ORG> to reach injustice wherever it is found Where injustice verging on inhumanity emerges from hacking human rights guaranteed in Part III and the victim beseeches the <ORG> to intervene and relieve this court will be a functional futility as a constitutional instrumentality if its guns do not go into action until the wrong is righted a clear power and therefore a public duty to give relief to sentences in prison settings the next question is the jurisprudential backing for the play of that jurisdiction In <NAME> case this <ORG> has rejected the hands off doctrine and it has been ruled that fundamental lights do not flee the person as he enters the prison although they may suffer shrinkage necessitated by incarceration Prisoners are still persons entitled to all constitutional rights unless their liberty has been constitutionally curtailed by procedures that satisfy all the requirements of due process Justice <NAME> strongly seconded the view I have previously stated my view that a prisoner does not shed his basic constitutional rights at the prison gate and I fully support the court holding that the interest of inmates in freedom from imposition of serious discipline is a liberty entitled to due process protection There is a warrant for this vigil The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Art Thus it is now clear law that a prisoner wears the armour of basic freedom even behind bars and that on breach thereof by lawless officials the law will respond to his distress signals through writ aid The Indian human has a constant companion the court armed with the Constitution It is therefore the court concern implicit in the power to deprive the sentences of his personal liberty to ensure that no more and no less than is warranted by the sentence happens The <ORG> has power and responsibility to intervene and protect the prisoner against mayhem crude or subtle and may use habeas corpus for enforcing imprison humanism and forbiddance of harsher restraints and heavier severities than the sentence carries There is little doubt that barbarities like bar betters and hand cuffs were recklessly being practised either on account of ignorant unconscionableness or willful viciousness in several detention camps We do think that there are many drawn from the class of penury who suffer more privations than their sentences justify <NAME> has stated Justice <NAME> has delivered an elaborate judgment which deals with important issues raised before us at great length and with great care and concern We agree with these guidelines and express ourselves to that effect since the core question raised in the present case and the cardinal principles we have accepted lead to the same conclusions The inhibition against its deprivation extended to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body by the amputation of an arm Or leg or the putting out of an eye or the destruction of any other organ of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world Therefore inside prisons are persons and their personhood if crippled by law keepers turning law breakers shall be forbidden by the Writ of this Court from such wrong doing A compulsion under the authority of law following upon a conviction to live in a prison house entails by its own force the deprivation of fundamental freedoms like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practise a profession A man of profession would thus stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence But the Constitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration Likewise even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law A sullen forlorn prisoner is a dangerous criminal in the making and the prison is the factory <NAME> rightly remarks In <ORG> argued that prisoners should have a right to visitation We see no reason why the right to be visited under reasonable restrictions should not claim current constitutional status For this purpose he relies on <ORG> their powers and duties as a functional substitute for a Prison ombudsman The orders passed under sub section of section of the Prisons Act should except in emergent cases in which immediate action is in the opinion of such Magistrate necessary be so expressed that the Superintendent may have time to refer if he thinks necessary to the Inspector General before taking action thereon Every visitor should have the power to call for and inspects any book or other record in the jail unless the Superintendent for reasons to be recorded in writing declines on the ground that its production is undesirable There should be one visitor book for both classes of visitors their remarks should in both cases be forwarded to the Inspector General who should pass such orders as he thinks necessary and a copy of the Inspector General order should be sent to the visitor concerned Thus ways must be developed to involve prisoners in the process of making decision that affect every aspect of their life in the prison The <ORG> shall take action against the investigating police for the apparently collusive dilatoriness and deviousness we have earlier indicated The lawyers so designated shall be bound to make periodical visits and record and report to the concerned court results which have relevance to legal grievances Any person who alleges that he has been subjected to torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by or at the instigation of a public official shall have the right to complain to and to have his case impartially examined by the competent authorities of the <ORG> concerned Wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture as defined in article I has been committed the competent authorities of the State concerned shall promptly proceed to an impartial investigation even if there has been no formal complaint There is a great need to utilize the furlough system in corrections We allow the petition and direct a writ to issue including the six mandates and further order that a copy of it be sent for suitable action to <ORG> and to all the State Governments since Prison Justice has pervasive relevance <NAME> I have read the judgment prepared by my learned brother
