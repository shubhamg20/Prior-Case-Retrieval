HEADNOTE The appellant which was a manufacturer of dye stuffs sold its product to two wholesale buyers at a uniform selling price described as the basic selling price less trade discount of Before the <ORG> authorities the appellants claimed that for the purpose of assessing the <ORG> duty the value of the dye stuffs should be taken to be the price at which the appellants sold the same to the two wholesale buyers less trade discount allowed to these wholesale buyers Dissatisfied with the decision of <ORG> the appellant filed a petition under art <ORG> held that where the entire production was sold by a manufacturer to one or more favoured distributors there was no wholesale market in the sense of open market at the site of the factory where an independent buyer could purchase the goods in wholesale and the assessable value must therefore be taken to be the price at which favoured distributors sell the goods in wholesale and if not in wholesale then in retail Where a manufacturer sells the goods manufactured by him in wholesale to a wholesale dealer at arm length and in the usual course of business the wholesale cash price charged by him to the wholesale dealer less trade discount would represent the value of the goods for the purpose of assessment of <ORG> The price received by the wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn sells the same in wholesale to other dealers would be irrelevant to the determination of the value of the goods and the goods would not be chargeable to <ORG> on that basis The value of the goods for the purpose of <ORG> must take into account only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit and it must not be loaded with post manufacturing cost or profit arising from post manufacturing operation The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal on certificate of fitness obtained under Article a of the Constitution is directed against a judgment of <ORG> dismissing Special Civil Application No of preferred by the appellants challenging the assessments to excise duty of certain dye stuffs manufactured by them The facts giving rise to the appeal are few and may be briefly stated as follows The position which therefore obtained during the relevant period was that the appellants sold the dye stuffs manufactured by them in wholesale units to <ORG> and to <ORG> at the basic selling price less trade discount of <ORG> and <ORG> in their turn resold a part of the dye stuffs in retail units to the textile mills and large consumers at the basic selling price and the balance in wholesale units to the distributors at higher selling prices with trade discount in case of <ORG> and trade discount in case of <ORG> the net selling prices charged by both of them however being the same and the distributors in their turn resold the dye stuffs to small consumers in retail units at the small consumers price Where under this Act any article is chargeable with duty at a rate dependent on the value of the article such value be deemed to be a the whole sale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or any other premises of manufacture or production or if a wholesale market does not exist for such article at such place at the nearest place where such market exists or where such price is not ascertainable the price at which an article of the like kind and quality sold or is capable of being sold by the manufacturer or producer or his agent at the time of the removal of of the article chargeable with duty from such factory or other premises for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or if such article is not sold or is not capable of being sold at such place at any other place nearest thereto The appellants contended before <ORG> that for the purpose of assessing the excise duty the value of the dye stuffs manufactured by the appellants should be taken to be the price at which the appellants sold the same in whole sale units to <ORG> and <ORG> less a uniform trade discount of which the appellants at the relevant time gave to these two wholesale buyers He took the view that the value of the dye stuffs for the purpose of assessment of excise duty should be taken to be the price at which <ORG> and <ORG> sold the dye stuffs to the distributors and The appellants were obviously not satisfied with this rather trivial and insignificant success and since their main plea was negatived by <ORG> they filed a petition in <ORG> under Art of the Constitution challenging the validity of the various orders made by the Excise authorities culminating in the order of <ORG> and seeking a writ directing <ORG> to refund excess duty amounting to Rs The Division Bench which heard the petition took the view following certain decisions of the Calcutta Mysore Andhra Pradesh and Bombay <ORG> that where the entire production is sold by a manufacturer to one or more favoured distributors there is no wholesale market in the sense of open market at the site of the factory where an independent buyer can purchase the goods in wholesale and in such a case the price at which the goods are sold by the manufacturer to the favoured distributors cannot be taken to be the assessable value of the goods but the assessable value must be taken to be the price at which the favoured distributors in their turn sell the goods in wholesale and if not in wholesale then in retail The appellants being agerieved by the decision of <ORG> preferred the present appeal after obtaining certificate of fitness from <ORG> SupCI It would be seen from the judgment of the <ORG> that the only ground on which the <ORG> negatived the contention of the applicants that the price charged by the appellants to <ORG> and <ORG> less trade discount should be taken as the assessable value was that <ORG> and <ORG> were favoured distributors and apart from them no independent buyer could purchase the dye stuffs in wholesale market at or near the place of manufacture so as to attract the appli cability of the first Part of section The respondent in that case carried on inter alia business of manufacturing air conditioners water coolers and their component parts The agreements provided among other things that the dealers should not sell the articles sold to them except in accordance with the list prices fixed by the respondent and the respondent would sell the articles to them at the list prices less discount The same argument was advanced before this Court on behalf of <ORG> which has found favour with <ORG> in the present case <NAME> kind and quality are sold or could be sold and that it also postulates a market where any wholesale purchaser can purchase the articles and as no articles of a like kind and quality were sold at or near the place of manufacture and as the wholesale sales were confined to the favoured buyers there was no wholesale market at the place of manufacture Even if it is assumed that the latter part of a proceeds on the assumption that the former part will apply only if there is a wholesale market at the place of manufacture for articles of a like kind and quality the question is what exactly is the concept of wholesale market in the context So even if there was no market in the physical sense of the term at or near the place of manufacture where the articles of a like kind and quality are or could be sold that would not in any way affect the existence of market in the proper sense of the term provided the articles themselves could be sold wholesale to traders even though the articles are sold to them on the basis of agreements whichconfer certain commercial advantages upon them If there is an actual price for the goods themselves at the time and place of sale and if that is a wholesale cash Price a be con sidered as members of their own class even though at the time and place of importation there are no other members and that the price obtained for them may correctly represent the price obtainable for goods of a like kind and quality at the time and place of importation Then with reference to the decisions of the various <ORG> which had taken a different view the learned Judge observed We do not think that these decisions in so far as they hold that the price of sales to wholesale dealers would not represent the wholesale cash price for the purpose of a of the Act merely because the man facturers had entered into agreements with them stipulating for commercial advantages are correct and proceeded to add If a manufacturer were to enter into agreements with dealers for wholesale sales of the articles manufactured on certain terms and conditions it would not follow from that alone that the price for those sales would not be the wholesale cash price for the purpose of a of the Act if the agreements were made at arms length and in the usual course of business This decision provides a complete refutation of the view taken by <ORG> in the present case Here on the contrary no retail sales at all were effected by the appellants and the entire production was sold in wholesale to <ORG> and <ORG> under agreements entered into with them The wholesale dealings between the appellants and <ORG> and <ORG> were purely commercial dcalings at arms length and the price charged by the appellants for sales in wholesale made to <ORG> and <ORG> less trade discount of was therefore clearly wholesale cash price within the meaning of a and it did not make any difference that the wholesale dealings of the appellants were confined exclusively to <ORG> and <ORG> and apart from these two no independent buyers could purchase the dye stuffs in wholesale from the at appellants They contended that all that a provides is that the value of the article sought to be charged to excise duty shall be deemed to be the wholesale cash price for which the article is sold or is capable of being sold and it does not say which wholesale cash price shall be taken to be the value of the article that charged by the manufacturer to the wholesale dealer or that charged by the wholesale dealer who having purchased the article from the manufacturer sells it in wholesale to another dealer The latter price they pointed out would equally be the wholesale cash price within the meaning of a as it would be the price at which the article is sold or in any event capable of being sold in the wholesale market and there is no reason why it should not be taken to be the value of the article for the purpose of assessment under a It violates two basic principles underlying imposition of excise duty The value of the goods for the purpose of excise must take into account only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit and it must not be loaded with post manufacturing cost or profit arising from post manufacturing operation If the price charged by the wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and sells them in wholesale to another dealer were taken as the value of the goods it would include not only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit of the manufacturer but also the wholesale dealer selling cost and selling profit and that would be wholly incompatible with the nature of excise It may be noted that wholesale market in a particular type of goods may be in several tiers and the goods may reach the consumer after a series of wholesale transactions For instance in a textile trade a manufacturer may sell his entire production to a single wholesale dealer and the latter may in his turn sell the goods purchased by him from the manufacturer to different wholesale dealers at State level and they may in their turn sell the goods to wholesale dealers at the district level and from the wholesale dealers at the district level the goods may pass by sale to Wholesale dealers at the city level and then ultimately from the wholesale dealers at the city level the goods may reach the consumers If excise were levied on the basis of second or subsequent wholesale price it would load the price with a postman factoring element namely Secondly this would also violate the concept of the factory gate sale which is the basis of determination of value of the goods for the purpose of excise There can therefore be no doubt that where a manufacturer sells the needs manufactured by him in wholesale to a wholesale dealer at arms length and in the usual course of business the wholesale cash price charged by him to the wholesale dealer less trade discount would represent the value of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise The price received by the wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn sells the same in wholesale to other dealers would be irrelevant to the determination of the value and the goods would not be chargeable to excise on that basis We direct the respondents to refund to the appellants forthwith the amount collected in excess of the correct duty of excise leviable in accordance with the principle laid down in this judgment The respondents will pay to the appellants costs in this <ORG> as well as in <ORG>
