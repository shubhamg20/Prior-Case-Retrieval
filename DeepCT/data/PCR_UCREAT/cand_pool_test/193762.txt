The build ings occupied by them as tenants were exempted from the operation of section of the East Punjab Urban Rent Re striction Act for a period of five years under the notification dated September issued under Section of the Act The landlords of these buildings had filed in the <ORG> suits for eviction against the tenants Thereupon the tenants raised objections on the ground that a the suits could not be decreed in view of the provisions of section of the Act which had placed an embargo on the landlord right to get his tenant evicted or to obtain possession of the building except in accordance with the provisions of section and the civil court had no jurisdiction to pass a decree of eviction or to execute the same against a tenant SCR this <ORG> had held that the notification granting exemption advanced the scheme object and purposes of the Act and It did not violate any of the provisions of the Act and was not discriminatory arbitrary or unreasonable The submissions made by the counsel are i Section is unconstitutional as it delegates essential legislative function to <ORG> without laying down any guidelines for exercise of the power of exemption ii the notification enlarges the period of exemption for an indefinite period tends to amend section of the Act and is contrary to the object and purpose of the Act rather it defeats the protection granted to a tenant by the Act iii the notification is discriminatory as it creates two class of tenants tenants of old buildings which never enjoyed the exemption from the provisions of the Act and the tenants of the newly constructed buildings which are denied the protection of the Act On the principles of res judicata and also in view of Article of the Constitution the law declared by this <ORG> in <ORG> case is binding on the petitioners The notification does not enlarge the period of exemption nor it destroys the protection granted to tenants under the Act Once the landlord institutes a suit before the expiry of the period of exemption the decree even if passed after the period of five years will not be subject to the provisions of section of the Act and the civil court will have jurisdiction to pass decree even after the expiry of the period of exemption and to execute the same notwith standing the provisions of section of the Act in view of the Notification dated September While considering the interpretation and validity of the provisions granting exemption either by statutory provision made in the Act or by notification issued under the Act it is necessary to bear in mind the object and purpose of exemption Section which provides for granting exemption from the provisions of the Act is by way of an exception to section and therefore the two provisions need not be consistent in their effect It is a settled rule of harmonious construction of statutes that a construction which would advance the object and purpose of the legislation should be followed and a construction which would result in reducing a provision of the Act to a dead letter or to defeat the object and pur pose of the statute should be avoided without doing any violence to the language The landlords of these buildings filed suits for eviction in <ORG> against the tenants Some of the tenants filed writ petitions under Article of the Con stitution before <ORG> challenging the jurisdiction of the civil court to proceed with the suits or to pass decree of eviction against them on the ground that on expiry of five years period of exemption Section of the Act became applicable and the civil court ceased to have juris diction The tenants filed Civil Appeals Special Leave Petitions in this Court challenging the correctness of the order of <ORG> Since all these cases involve common questions the same are being disposed of by a common order The object of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act is to provide safeguards to tenants against exploitation by landlords who seek to take undue advantage of the pressing need for accommodation Section places an embargo on the landlord right to get his tenant evicted or to obtain possession of the building A landlord seeking to evict a tenant is required to apply to the Controller appointed under the Act and if the Controller after giving opportuni ty to the tenant is satisfied that the grounds set out in Section and are made out he may make order di recting the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building The remaining provisions of the Act deal with appeals revisions and <ORG> powers to appoint <ORG> and other allied matters Under the scheme of the Act a tenant of a building in urban area to which the Act applies cannot be evicted from the rented building or land except in accordance with the provisions of Section of the Act and the civil court has no jurisdic tion to pass a decree of eviction or to execute the same against a tenant exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act Punjab Act No III of as applica ble to the Union Territory of Chandigarh the Chief Commissioner Chandigarh is pleased to direct that the provisions of the said Act shall not apply to buildings constructed in the urban area of Chandigarh for a period of five years with effect from the date of sewer age connection is granted in respect of such buildings by the competent authority under rule of the Punjab Capital evelopment and Regulation Building Rules The aforesaid Notification was followed by another Notification dated September issued by the Chief Commissioner Chandigarh setting out the manner and method for computing period of five years of exemption granted to the buildings con structed in the urban areas of Chandigarh In exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act as applicable to the Union Territory of Chandigarh the Chief Commissioner Chandi garh is pleased to direct that the provisions of Section of the said Act shall not apply to buildings exempted from the provisions of the Act for a period of five years vide Chand igarh Administration Notification No LD dated the st January in respect of decrees passed by Civil Courts in suits for ejectment of tenants in possession of these buildings instituted by the landlords against such tenants during the period of exemption whether such decrees were or are passed during the period of exemption or at anytime thereaf ter But the Notification dated th September directed that the provisions of Section of the Act shall not apply to buildings situate in the urban area of Chandigarh for a period of five years in respect of decrees passed by civil courts in suits for ejectment of tenants instituted during the period of exemption notwithstanding the fact that such decrees are passed during the period of exemption or at any time thereafter The effect of the Notification is that protection granted to tenants against eviction under Section of the Act is not available to them for a period of five years and if the landlord institutes a suit for eviction against the tenant within the aforesaid period of five years the restrictions contained in Section of the Act shall not apply to such suits and the civil court has juris diction to pass decree of eviction and to execute the same even though five years period of exemption expired during the pendency of the suit issued in exercise of the power conferred under Section of the Act granting exemp tion to buildings constructed during the years and from all the provisions of the Act for a period of five years and the provisions of Section of the Act were not to apply in respect of decrees for eject ment of tenants in possession of buildings provided the suit was instituted in civil court by the landlord against the tenant during the period of exemption This Court upheld the Notification granting exemption and it further held that if the suit was instituted within the period of exemption decree could be passed even after the expiry of the period of five years and the same could be executed On an elaborate discussion this Court upheld the validity of Section of the Act and the impugned Notification The Court held that the Notification granting exemption advanced the scheme object and purposes of the Act and it did not violate any of the provisions of the Act and it was not discriminatory arbitrary or unreasonable Most of the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the appel lants and petitioners are the same which have already been considered and rejected by this Court in the aforesaid cases but learned counsel made attempts to raise some additional submissions in assailing the validity of the Notification to which we shall refer at the appropriate stage When the earlier decision of this Court in <ORG> case supra was brought to their notice where the impugned Notification itself had been held valid the learned counsel made an effort to challenge the validity of the Notification on additional grounds The submissions made by the counsels are i Section is unconstitutional as it delegates essential legislative function to <ORG> without laying down any guidelines for exercise of the power of exemption ii the impugned Notification enlarges the period of exemption for an indefinite period and it tends to amend Section of the Act and it is contrary to the object and purpose of the Act rather it defeats the protection granted to a tenant by the Act iii the Notification is discriminatory as it creates two class of tenants tenants of old buildings which never enjoyed the exemption from the provisions of the Act and the tenants of the newly constructed buildings which are denied the protection of the Act Some of the learned counsels appearing for the tenants submitted that we should refer these cases to <ORG> in view of the observations made by a three Judges Bench of this Court in <NAME> case <NAME> Srnt We do feel that the second part of the impugned notification issued by the Chief Commissioner Chandigarh dated September under Section of the Act in effect permits the Civil <ORG>s to pass decrees in suits for ejectment of tenants instituted by the land lords even after the expiry of the period of exemption contrary to the statutory bar contained in Section of the Act and there fore it could not be upheld On rd April <NAME> as he then was presid ing over a three Judges Bench held that reference to a larger Bench was only in respect of suits for ejectment of tenants instituted by the landlords after the expiry of period of exemption and it did not cover cases where suits were instituted by the landlords prior to the expiry of the period of exemption although decrees were passed subsequent to the period of exemption In this view <NAME> case wherein suit had been instituted during the period of exemption was not referred to a Constitution Bench Another Bench consisting of Hon ble <NAME> and Hon ble <NAME> JJ It appears that during the pendency of <NAME> case the tenants encouraged by the observations made in the order dated approached this Court again to challenge the validity of the Notifica tion by means of the present batch of petitions In our view observations made in <NAME> case by a Bench of three Judges do not pertain to suits filed by the landlords during the period of exemption although decree may have been passed after the expiry of exemption In the instant cases none of the cases fall into that category there is therefore no justification for referring these cases to a larger Bench Before we consider the submissions made on behalf of the tenants we would like to point out that some of the tenants who were unsucessful before this court in <ORG> case have again filed petitions challenging the validity of Section and the impugned Notification on additional grounds Once the petitioners challenged the validity of the impugned Notification dated in earlier proceedings they ought to have raised all the grounds which could have been raised in impugning the valid ity of Section and the Notification if they failed to raise a ground in earlier petition they cannot raise that ground now in the present proceedings It is therefore no longer open to the petitioner tenants to challenge the validity of Section of the Act and the impugned Notifica tion dated on the ground that some points had not been urged or considered in <ORG> case On the principles of res judicata and also in view of Article of the Constitution the law declared by this <ORG> in <ORG> case is binding on the petitioners But even otherwise the submissions made on their behalf in impugning the validity of Section and the Notification dated are devoid of any merit as we shall presently discuss the same decided on th October this Court held that Section of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act does not suffer from the vice of exces sive delegation of legislative power nor it violates Article of the Constitution Section of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act Conferring power on the <ORG> to exempt certain accommodations from all Or any of the provisions of the Act was upheld in the State of Madhya Pradesh <NAME> <NAME> MPLJ We find no good reason to take a different view we therefore hold that Section of the Act does not suffer from vice of constitutional infirmity and it is a valid provision Landlords of the buildings took full advantage of the situation and they charged exhorbitant rent from tenants and very often evicted them by terminating tenancy under the provisions of Transfer of Property Act The tenants were helpless as the suits once filed by the landlord after terminating the tenancy were bound to succeed The <ORG> of different States took cognizance of the situation and enacted rent control legis lations providing safeguards for tenants by making provision for fixation of reasonable rent and also placing restric tions on the landlords right to evict tenants Generally the rent control legislation of various States exclude the jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain a suit or pass a decree of eviction against a tenant instead the jurisdic tion to evict a tenant is conferred on Rent Controller or some designated authority and the statutory grounds for eviction of a tenant have been laid down The <ORG> stepped in to meet the situation in making provision for granting exemption to newly constructed buildings for cer tain number of years from the operation of the restrictions of the rent control legislations Learned counsel urged that the impugned Notification enlarged the period of exemption for an indefinite period and it tends to amend Section of the Act and it is con trary to the object and purpose of the Act A suit if instituted during the period of exemption could not be decreed nor such decree could be executed after the expiry of five years period but the last portion of the Notification which states that Section of the Act shall not apply to decree of civil courts whether such decree was passed during the period of exemption or at any time thereafter enlarged the period of exemption for an indefinite period of time and it seeks to amend Section of the Act We do not find merit in the submission As noticed earlier Section imposes a complete ban against the eviction of a tenant in execution of a decree passed by a civil court before or after the commencement of the Act and it further lays down that a tenant in possession of a building or rented land shall not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of Section or an order made in pursuance of the provisions of the Act SubSection of Section sets out statutory grounds on which the Controller an authority constituted under the Act has power to pass order of eviction against a tenant Section takes away the jurisdiction of civil court to pass a decree of eviction or execution thereof against a tenant in respect of a building which is subject to the provisions of the Act While doing so the Notifi cation has taken care to make the exemption effective by providing that the exemption shall be available to the building even if the decree is passed after the expiry of the period of five years provided the suit is instituted during the period of exemption Once the landlord institutes a suit before the expiry of the period of exemption the decree even if passed after the period of five years will not be subject to the provisions of Section of the Act Section which provides for granting exemption from the provisions of the Act is by way of an exception to Section and therefore the two provisions need not be consistent in their effect The submission that the Notification granting exemption to newly constructed buildings is contrary to the object and purpose of the Act ignores the resultant effect of exemption In <ORG> case supra similar argument raised on behalf of the tenants was repelled and the Court held that the Notifi cation granting exemption was not contrary to the object and purpose of the Act instead it advanced the ultimate purpose of the Act to provide accommodation to tenants SCC provisions of the Haryana Act granting exemption to newly constructed buildings for a period of ten years was held to advance the purpose of rent control legislation In our opinion the impugned Notification granting exemption is not contrary to the object and purpose of the Act nor it destroys protection granted to tenants under the Act In <NAME> case supra the Notification granting exemption did not direct that the decree passed after the expiry of period of exemption would also be exempted from the operation of Section of the Act This Court rejected the submission saying that the contention on the very face of it if accepted would lead to incongruity and shall nullify the purpose for which exemption was grant ed The Court held that while considering the purpose of exemption of building from operation of Section the Notification granting exemption must be interpreted in the light of the object and purpose of exemption and if the contention that both the suit and the decree should be passed within the period of exemption is accepted that would defeat and nullify the purpose of exemption Having regard to time normally consumed for adjudica tion of a suit by the civil court it is too much to expect that a suit filed within the period of exemption of five years can be disposed of finally within the period of exemp tion The exemption contemplated by the Notification permits the institution of a suit within the period of exemption taking into account the delay caused in disposal Of the suit it further protects the jurisdiction of the civil court in passing decree of eviction with a view to make the exemption effective and meaningful In this view if the submission made on behalf of the tenants is accepted it would render the exemption illusory as in reality it will be impossible for a landlord to get the suit decreed within the period of exemption even if he instituted the suit within the period of exemption Interpretation of the Act and the impugned notification as suggested on behalf of the tenants if accepted would defeat the purpose of the benefi cial social legislation It is a settled rule of harmonious construction of statute that a construction which would advance the object and purpose of the legislation should be followed and a construction which would result in reducing a provision of the Act to a dead letter or to defeat the object and purpose of the statute should be avoided without doing any violence to the language We therefore reject the submission made on behalf of tenants The Court held that a suit instituted within the period of exemption for eviction of the tenant could legal ly be decreed even if the period of exemption expired during the pendency of the suit These decisions no doubt support the view we are taking but we do not consider it necessary to consider these decisions in detail as the provisions of the Rent Control Legislation which were considered in those decisions were quite different which did not expressly preserve the jurisdiction of the civil court to decree the suit after expiry of the period of exemption while the impugned <ORG> in express terms maintains the juris diction of the civil court to decree a suit for eviction even if the period of exemption expires during the pendency of the suit There is no provision under the Urban Buildings Regulation of Letting Rent and Eviction Act or the Haryana Urban Control of Rent and Eviction Act containing similar provision as contained in the im pugned <ORG> It is not necessary to discuss the question further as we are in full agreement with the view taken in <NAME> case supra We further hold that civil court has jurisdiction to pass decree even after the expiry of period of exemption in suits instituted during the period of exemption and to execute the same notwithstanding the provisions of Section of the Act
