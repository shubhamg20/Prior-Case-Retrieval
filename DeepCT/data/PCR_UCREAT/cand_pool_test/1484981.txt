At the enquiry <NAME> stated that he had nothing to say and knew nothing about the theft <NAME> was told to ask those persons what they had to say though he was neither supplied with the copies of the statements made by them nor the statements were read over to him at the time of the enquiry The company came up in appeal by special leave to <ORG> where for the first time it raised the question of the qualification and competency of the one member <ORG> under Of the Act Held further that if there was defect in the conduct of the enquiry by the employer it could be cured if all the relevant evidence including the witnesses who were not examined in the presence of the workman were produced before the <ORG> thereby giving the party an opportunity to cross examine them and leaving it to the <ORG> to consider the evidence and decide the case on merits <NAME> remained in jail up to February when he was released on bail He reported for duty on February but the manager suspended him for ten days from March Thereafter he was served with a charge sheet on March asking him to show cause why he should not be dismissed for gross misconduct as mentioned above We shall mention later in detail what happened at the enquiry as that is the main point which requires consideration in this appeal Thereupon there was an application to this <ORG> for special leave to appeal which was granted and that is how the matter has come up before us Two points have been urged before us on behalf of the company namely the <ORG> was not a competent tribunal under of the Industrial Disputes Act No XIV of hereinafter called the Act as it then stood and the award of the <ORG> is not sustainable in law as it shows as if the <ORG> was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held by the company and this it was not entitled to do Reference in this case was made on March before the amending Act No XXXVI of came into force In the circumstance we are not prepared to allow the company to raise this question before us for the first time and so we reject the contention under this head So far as the second reason is concerned there is force in the criticism on behalf of the company that the <ORG> had proceeded as if it was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held by the company He replied that he had nothing to say adding that he knew nothing about the theft He was then told that the people who had given evidence against him were present and he should ask them what they had to say He replied that he would put no questions to them It also does not show that copies of the statements made by the witnesses were supplied to <NAME> before he was asked to question them This <ORG> speaking through <NAME> observed as follows in that connection at Stating it broadly and without intending it to be exhaustive it may be observed that rules of natural justice require that a party should have the opportunity of adducing all relevant evidence on which he relies that the evidence of the opponent should be taken in his presence and that he should be given the opportunity of cross examining the witnesses examined by that party and that no materials should be relied on against him without his being given an opportunity of explaining them It will be immediately clear that these principles were not followed in the enquiry which took place on March inasmuch as the witnesses on which the company relied were not examined in the presence of <NAME> It is true that the principles laid down in that case are not meant to be exhaustive was held that the reading out of the contents of the police report by the Chairman at the hearing of the appeal was enough compliance with the rules of natural justice as there was nothing in the rules requiring a copy of it to be furnished to any of the parties The narration of facts as to what happened on March which we have given above shows that even this was not done in this case for there is no evidence that copies of the statements of witnesses who had given evidence against <NAME> were supplied to him or even that the statements made by the witnesses to the manager were read out in extensor to <NAME> before he was asked to question them The defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have been cured if the company had produced the witnesses before the <ORG> and given an opportunity to <NAME> to cross examine them there The same principle would apply in case of adjudication under of the Act and if there was defect in the enquiry by the employer he could make good that defect by producing necessary evidence before the tribunal We therefore dismiss the appeal In the circumstances we are of opinion that the parties should bear their own costs of this <ORG>
