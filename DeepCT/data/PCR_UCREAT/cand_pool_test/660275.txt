Also provisions were made in various statutes conferring on the <NAME> certain privileges and benefits A communication to the effect was sent to all <NAME> in India who had been previously recognised under art The phrase for the time being cannot mean that any person can be appointed who has no claim whatever or that temporary appointments may be made or that no appointment need be made The obligation to recognise a Ruler is bound up with the other guarantees contained in articles and and the definition in article is merely the key to find a particular Ruler The Constitution gave the right to the President to recognise a Ruler for the time being but it cannot be stretched to give a paramountly of the same character as that enjoyed by the British <ORG> The rights became consti tutionally protected rights which so long as the Ruler line was not extinct belonged to the Ruler for the time being Article is the converse of paramountcy inasmuch as it compels the two limbs of government to have due regard to the guarantees and assurances given to the <NAME> Since there are no sovereign or political powers under our Constitution every action of the executive limb of government must seek justification in some law The very existence of article which it is said incorporates some kind of paramountcy or act of state shows that there is no political power outside the law otherwise an additional bar would hardly have been necessary vi The argument on behalf of <ORG> that article only lays down the source and manner of payment but creates no right to claim receive or enforce payment is a complete misreading of the article As soon as an appropriation Act is passed there established credit debt and the outstanding Privy Purse becomes the property of the Ruler in the hands of the government The power conferred by the clause has to be exercised consistently with and in aid of the constitutional scheme The power is plainly coupled with duty a duty The power of the President to determine the status of the <NAME> by cancelling or withdrawing recognition to effectuate the policy of the Government to abolish the concept of <NAME>hip is therefore liable to be challenged in these petitions The functions of the President of India stem from the Constitution not from a concept of the British <ORG> identified or unidentified Article does not merely incorporate recognition of the obligation to pay privy purse under covenants incurred by the Government of the Dominion of India it gives rise to a liability dehors the covenants I held inapplicable vii The courts have jurisdiction to interpret and to determine the true meaning of articles and and the bar to the jurisdiction of the courts by article is a limited bar If the constitutional provision relating to a covenant is the source of the right claimed to accrue or liability claimed to arise then clearly under the second limb the jurisdiction of the court to entertain a dispute with respect to the right or obligation is barred viii It cannot be urged that the jurisdiction of the courts to enforce rights and obligations arising out of the covenants was excluded because the rights and obligations arose out of acts of <ORG> and by constitutional provision that exclusion was affirmed and extended after the Constitution Jurisdiction of the courts will however not by excluded where the relief claimed is founded on a statutory provision enacted to give effect to personal rights under article xii Therefore the <ORG> will give effect to the constitutional mandate in art only if satisfied that the dispute arises out of any provision of a covenant which is in force and was entered into or executed before the commencement of the Constitution and to which the predecessor of <ORG> was a party or that it is in respect of rights liabilities or obligations accruing or arising under any provision of the Constitution in relation to a covenant but since he right to privy purse arises under article the dispute in respect of which does not fall in either clause the jurisdiction of the court is not excluded xiii Since the order of the President is without authority of law there is a clear infringement of the guarantee of the fundamental rights under articles and of the Constitution A Per <NAME> The meaning given to the expression Ruler in article is only for the purpose of the Constitution and not for any other purpose The power has to be exercised in accordance with law in other words it has to be exercised as a quasi judicial power This <ORG> is not the forum for going into political issues nor is it concerned with political passions surrounding the issues arising for decision in this case There is nothing like a political power under our Constitution in the matter of relationship between the executive and the citizens ix The impugned order is also unconstitutional for the reason that the power conferred under art The circumstances under which the impugned order came to be made show that there was attempt to do indirectly what the government could not do directly Article has to be read harmoniously with articles and For the purpose of giving necessary direction to the <ORG> and <ORG> executive as well as to the <ORG> and <ORG> legislatures the Constitution recognised the rights accruing and liabilities and obligations arising under various agreements and covenants which recognition made those right liabilities and obligations enforceable I and <ORG> of Gujarat <NAME> held inapplicable The contention that article excludes also the right arising from article because article also protects personal rights falling within the scope of article has no force Further there was no purpose in guaranteeing the payment ofPrivy Purse under article and then taking away the right to recoverthem under article After article came into force there is no legal relationship between the covenants and agreements and that article If an item of expenditure charged on <ORG> merely means that the expenditure is non votable then there was no need to provide in article that so much of the estimate as relates to expenditure charged upon <ORG> shall not be submitted to the vote of <ORG> No sooner the President recognises the Ruler of an Indian <ORG> he becomes entitled to <ORG> guaranteed under article from the date the Constitution came into force Power is an authority whereas a right in the context in which it is used in article signifies property The word relating to is a word of wide import but in the context in which it is used in article it must have a narrower meaning It has nothing to do with the agreements and covenants viii Since the President power or right or duty or obligation to recognise a person as a Ruler arises not merely out of the provisions in article but also the covenants merger agreements or instruments of accession the dispute is one which arises out a provision of the Constitution relating to a treaty agreement covenant etc If the dispute is so covered the court is precluded from examining whether the contention of the party asserting a right was genuine or of real substance There are no legal rights as to recognition of rulership payment of Privy Purse and enjoyment of rights and privileges iv Recognition of a Ruler under article is only for the limited purpose of payment of privy purse and it has no other reference There cannot be any legal right to recognition because the Power of the president to recognise for the time being repels any concept of legal right to <NAME>hip Since the obligation to recognise a Ruler arises only from the covenants and agreements and there cannot be any legal enforceable right to recognition under the covenant no legal right to arises under article either If the petitioner challenges the power of the President to derecog nise him he claims that he has a right to continue as a Ruler and this is a right related to covenants ix The proposition that if the order is a nullity there is no bar of jurisdiction is inapplicable to the present case where the question for consideration is of the Constitution which under some articles confers jurisdiction on this <ORG> and in another article excludes the jurisdiction of the <ORG> The fallacy of the petitioners submission that because the order of the President is a nullity the petitioners property rights are invaded and hence the jurisdiction of this <ORG> is attracted is in totally overlooking the provisions of article which excludes in express and unambiguous terms the jurisdiction of this <ORG> notwithstanding any provision of the Constitution When the Constitution which invests this <ORG> with jurisdiction with one hand divests it of jurisdiction with another in specifically designed disputes the attempt to overreach the article which bars the jurisdiction of the <ORG> will be totally impermeable xiii The words charged on and paid out of <ORG> mean that the sums shall not be submitted to the vote of <ORG> and article makes a provision to that effect Therefore articles and can have no application to privy purses and privileges This political bargain was carried into the Constitution by the insertion of article for payment of privy purse article for continuance of privileges and article for recognition of Princes and the political character was preserved by inserting article which bar the jurisdiction of the court in respect of disputes arising out of covenants and agreements and these articles which are related to the covenants and agreements Privy purses is not a legal right to property and there is no fundamental right to privy purses There is no fundamental right to rulership Since the issues involved in all the petitions are common and there are only minor differences in the steps before the States merged with <ORG> it is sufficient if an illustrative petition is dealt with Immediately afterwards the India Provisional Constitution Order was promulgated and certain substitutions were made in the Government of India Act by the Governor General by virtue of subsection of Section read with section of the Indian Independence Act Sections and of the Government of India Act were replaced by the following sections Accession of Indian States An Indian State shall be deemed to have acceded to the Dominion if the Governor General has signified his acceptance of an Instrument of Accession executed by the Ruler thereof whereby the Ruler on behalf of the State a declares that he accedes to the <ORG> with the intent that the Governor General the <ORG> Legislature <ORG> and any other <ORG> authority established for the purposes of the <ORG> shall by virtue of his Instrument of Accession but subject al ways to the terms thereof and for the purposes only of the <ORG> exercise in relation to the <ORG> such functions as may be vested in them by order under this Act and assumes the obligation of ensuring that due effect is given within the State to the provisions of this Act so far as they are applicable therein by virtue of the Instrument of Accession An Instrument of Accession shall specify the matters which the Ruler accepts as matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for the State and the limitations if any to which the power of <ORG> to make laws for the State and the exercise of the executive authority the <ORG> in the State are respectively to be subject References in this Act to the Ruler of a State include references to any persons for the time being exercising the powers of the Ruler of the State whether by reason of the Ruler minority or for any other reason On his part he undertook the obligation of ensuring that effect was given to the provi sions of <ORG> Act in his State He accented that <ORG> would make law with respect to matters specified in the Schedule to his Instrument There were certain reservations particularly in regard to any future constitution of India affecting the continuance or his sovereignty in and over the <ORG> and the exercise of any powers authority and rights then enjoyed by him as Ruler The <NAME> had jurisdiction to make laws for the peace and good Government of those areas whether with or without consultation with his <ORG> but subject to direction or instructions of <ORG> By that Instrument he was to accept the making of laws by the Dominion <ORG> on all matters mentioned in Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to <ORG> Act except the entries in List I relating to any tax or duty The executive authority of the United <ORG> subject to the provisions of the Covenant and a Constitution to be framed later was to be exercised by the <NAME> and the competant <ORG> of the United <ORG> was to be given the competence to confer functions upon the subordinate authorities but the Covenant was not to be deemed to transfer to the <NAME> any functions conferred by any existing law on any <ORG> Judge officer or local or other authority in a Covenanting <ORG> The <NAME> was also given power to promulgate Ordinances The said amount is intended to cover all the expenses of the Ruler and his family including expenses of his residence marriages and other ceremonies etc The Rajpramukh shall cause the said amount to be paid to the Ruler in four equal instalments at the beginning of each quarter in advance Article XV gave complete immunity to the Ruler in respect of past acts and omissions There were other guarantees and also immunity for past acts or omissions in the execution of duty as a Public servant It was divided into two sections Salute States and <ORG> In the Merger Agreement of the Maharao of Kutch there were other articles such as immunity for past acts of the Maharao in his personal capacity or otherwise and also a guarantee for continuance in service of the permanent members of the Public services of Kutch and for their conditions of service pensions and leave salaries and immunity for past acts Article was amended by the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act by deleting clause but is quoted here as it was before the Amendment Where under any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of this Constitution the payment of any sums free of tax has been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India to any Ruler of such State as Privy Purse In this Constitution unless the context otherwise requires the following expressions have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them that is to say Rajpramukh means a in relation to the State of Hyderabad the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Nizam of Hyderabad in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir or the State of Mysore the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Maharaja of that State and in relation to any other State specified in Part of the First Schedule the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Rajpramukh of the State and includes in relation to any of the said States any person for the time being recognised by the President as competent to exercise the powers of the Rajpramukh in relation to that State These two repeals were occasioned by the constitutional readjustment of States when Part States disappeared In the exercise of the power of <ORG> or of the <ORG> of a State to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the <ORG> or of a State due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause of article with respect to the personal rights privileges and dignities of the Ruler of an Indian State Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution but subject to the provisions of article neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument which was entered into or executed before the commencement of this Constitution by any Ruler of an Indian State and to which the Government of the Dominion of India or any of its predecessors Governments was a party and which has or has been continued in operation after such com mencement or in any dispute in respect of any right accruing under or any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of this Constitution relating to any such treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other smilar instrument Only three States retained their integrity but when the Constitution came into force they too became part of <ORG> on a later date The total amount of the Privy Purses came to Rs During the negotiations letters were written to the <NAME> to assure them that the Privy Purse was fixed in prepatuity and the freedoms enjoyed by them would be continued There were perhaps a number of informal meetings and consultations He gave as his reason for the President action that the Bill amending the Constitution was lost by a fraction of a vote in one of the <ORG> that there was widespread support against this out moded and antiquated system of Privy Purses that even those who opposed the Bill supported the abolition and that it was Government policy to put an and to the concept of <NAME>hip and the abolition of Privy Purses and the Privileges He said that there was nothing by which the <NAME> could be forced to merge their States with India and that the Privy Purses were quid pro quo for parting with the ruling power by the <NAME> and the dissolution of their States as separate units He exhorted <ORG> that the Indian Peoples on their part should ensure fully the guarantee given to them and concluded Our failure to do so would be a breach of faith and seriously prejudice the stabilization of the New Order The President action robbed the articles of their content which <ORG> did not allow to be done and thus the order of the President indirectly had the effect of amending the Constitution Since there was no authority of law and no compensation the action was said to offend Articles and of the Constitution Since the article began with the words Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the article could only be read by itself and even the chapter on Fundamental Rights was excluded Since the claim was based upon what was recognised in these instruments this <ORG> could not give any relief as it had no jurisdiction to do so The bar of Article covered such a case also because there was nothing to show that any recognition carrying with it a Privy Purse and Privileges was ever intended to be perennial even when the State policy demanded an abolition <ORG> however places the bar at the very threshold and contents that the dispute is such as is expressly barred by Article but the petitioners contend that there is no dispute at all under Articles and or it is not of the kind contemplated by that Article <ORG> asks that the question of jurisdiction be decided first because in their opinion it is conclusive while the other side contends that there is no dispute once the invalidity of the President order is established since articles and would then speak for themselves Reference was made in this connection by the Attorney General to the White Paper on Indian States Mr <NAME> book already referred to and the account contained in a recent book The Great Divide by Mr <NAME> Its supremacy is not based only upon treaties and engagements but exists independently of them and quite apart from its prerogative in matters relating to foreign powers and policies it is the right and duty of <ORG> while scrupulously respecting all treaties and engagements with the Indian States to preserve peace and good order throughout India The consequences that follow are so well known and so clearly apply no less to <NAME> than to other Rulers that it seems hardly necessary to point them out Other illustrations could be added no less inconsistent than the foregoing with the suggestion that except in matters relating to foreign powers and policies the <ORG> of Your Exalted Highness and <ORG> stand on a plane of equality Paramountcy as such was no more as there was no paramount power and no vassal There is no provision to that effect in the Constitution or even the Covenants and Agreements That the Constitution gave the right to the President to recognise a Ruler for the time being is apparent enough but it cannot be stretched to give a paramountcy of the same character as that enjoyed by the British crown These rights became constitutionally protected rights which so long as the Ruler line was not extinct belonged to the Ruler for the time being On the other hand article says in admonitory terms that in the exercise of the power of <ORG> or of the <ORG> of a <ORG> to make laws or in the exercise of executive power of the <ORG> or of a <ORG> due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given in any such Covenant or Agreement as is referred to in clause of Article with respect to the personal rights privileges and dignities of the Ruler of an Indian <ORG> This provision is rather the converse of paramountcy in as much as it compels the two limbs of Government to have due regard to the guarantees and assurances given to the <NAME> What those words mean I shall consider later but I reject the claim that the President or the Government of India can invoke the doctrine to sustain an illegal inroad upon the rights of citizens I further pointed out that in civil commotion or even in war or peace the <ORG> cannot act catastrophically outside the ordinary law and there is legal remedy for its wrongful acts against its own subjects or even a friendly alien within the <ORG> Since there are no sovereign or political powers under our Constitution every action of the Executive limb of Government must seek justification in some law paramountcy or act of <ORG> shows that there is no political power outside the law otherwise an additional bar would hardly have been necessary In the <ORG> case <ORG> observed It is scarcely necessary to point out that the capacity to possess civil rights does not necessarily imply the capacity to exercise those rights oneself Thus a rule of International Law formerly held the field that persons holding such rights are incapable of asserting them in the international sphere or in <ORG> It is now gradually gaining recognition that if there be some municipal legislation giving enforceability to the right then the right can be claimed in <ORG> The argument of Poland in the case was that the agreement between Poland and <ORG> regulating the conditions of employment of the Railway officials taken over in <ORG> created rights only between Poland and <ORG> and as that agreement was not incorporated in the laws of Poland it created no rights for individuals and that the <ORG> Courts had no jurisdiction to decide in respect of those rights That there is such an intention in the present case can be established by reference to the terms of the Beamtenabkommen Those Civil servants would not have been able to enforce these agreements in Municipal Courts by their own individual steps if there was no law or the rights were not otherwise recognised The individual rights and obligations no doubt originally flowed from a contract between High Contracting Parties and might not have create a vinculum juris in favour of third parties but the Constitution having granted rights and created corresponding obligations those rights and obligations are enforceable in our Courts Therefore there is no bar to the jurisdiction of this Court except that created by Article Again by Article the President is not answerable to any <ORG> for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise of those powers and duties except in an investigation of a charge under Article It is also contented that the power to recognise itself includes the power to withdraw recognition The phrase for the time being cannot mean that any person can be appointed who has no claim whatever or that temporary appointments may be made or that no appointment need be made But where the Ruler exists or there is a suitable successor the power to recognise a Ruler is implicit just as much as the power to withdraw recognition in suitable cases The obligation to recognise a Ruler is bound up with the other guarantees contained in articles and The President was incompetent to do so and therefore his act must be treated as a nullity The reason for the decision is not as fully given as the importance of the subject required and therefore I permit myself to say a few words here I shall show later that the obligation to pay the Privy Purse to a Ruler is absolute and the right to claim it when due subsists in each Ruler It is said that this creates a right in personam and not a right in rem Therefore there is enforcement of an obligation in personam but not a right to reach property which can be said to belong to the <NAME> According to him property in action exists Where a man hath not the occupation but merely a bare right to occupy the thing in question the possession whereof may however be recovered by a suit or action at law He was of opinion that till then the thing or its equivalent remains in suspense and the injured party has only the right and not the occupation <NAME> The Institutes also says that till the fulfilment of the obligations the creditor has right only against the debtor and not against a thing Thus a debt or a liability to pay money passes through four stages First there is a debt not yet due The debt has not yet become a part of the obligor things because no net liability has yet arisen Here again the amount due has not become a part of the obligor things The law begins to recognise such property in insolvency in dealing with it in fraud of creditors fraudulent preference of one creditor against another subrogation equitable estoppel stoppage intransitu etc A credit debt is then a debt fully provable and which is fixed and absolutely owing The last stage is when the debt becomes a judgment debt by reason of a decree of a Court As soon as an Appropriation Act is passed there is established a credit debt and the outstanding Privy Purse becomes the property of the Ruler in the hands of Government The learned Attorney General however contends that Article which charges the Privy Purse on the Consolidated Fund of India to be paid to the Ruler free of all taxes on income does not provide that it shall be paid and therefore the Article only lays down the source and manner of payment but creates no right to claim receive or enforce payment The learned Attorney General used the historical events as background for his contention that Article must be construed as giving an exclusive right of determination to the President on the subject of recognition and withdrawal of recognition He cited a large number of authorities in support of his case that an act of <ORG> is not subject to the scrutiny of the Courts In other words we have to satisfy ourselves before we deny out jurisdiction that of the articles which one or all of them answer the description I shall now apply this test to article and beginning with article since to my mind it is the plainest of all and is definitely within the description It does so by saying that a Ruler is a person a who entered into a Covenant or Agreement before the commencement of the Constitution and the payment of any sum free of tax had been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India as privy purse or the successor of such Ruler There were other guarantees as in the Merger Agreements of Bilaspur and Bhopal quoted earlier which are ignored by the Article In this connection there is no difference between Art It is only when the Privy Purse is a settled fact of which the <ORG> can take notice without having to construe the Covenants for itself that the bar of Article is avoided Neither the paramountcy of the Grand <NAME> who could give Subehdarships to his Generals as he pleased nor the paramountcy of the British <ORG> has descended to him He also referred to cases in which the question of the application of article had arisen Under the Madhya Bharat Gangajali Fund Trust Act enacted by <ORG> the Ruler of the State of Gwalior is one of the three trustees authorised to manage <ORG> settled by the State and to apply the income thereof for charitable purposes The Bill was declared passed with the amendment that the provisions thereof shall come into oporeation with effect from October Government is fortified in the belief that there is widespread support in the country for putting an end to an out moded and antiquated system which permitted the enjoyment of privileges and privy purses by a small section of our people without any corresponding social obligations on their part Orders have been issued in pursuance of the decision and that by the order the rights guaranteed to the petitioner under Arts By the order of the President withdrawing his recognition as Ruler the petitioner is denied the right to the privy purse and to the personal rights privileges and dignities accorded to him as a Ruler he is also denied the benefit of the exemption from liability to pay income tax under a of the Income tax Act Wealth tax under iii xiv of the Wealth tax Act Gift tax under xiv of the Gift tax and of the exemption from liability to pay duty under the Sea Customs Act which remains operative under the Customs Act he is also deprived of the statutory protection that he shall not be sued without the consent of <ORG> under of the Code of Civil Procedure and that cognizance of any offence alleged to have been committed by him shall not be taken by any Court without the previous sanction under A of the Code of Criminal Procedure If the order of the President is without authority of law as the petitioner contends it is there is a clear infringement of the guarantee of the fundamental rights under Arts Validity of the order of the President is challenged on the grounds that the President has no power to withdraw re cognition of a Ruler once recognised exercise of the power to withdraw recognition assuming that the President has such power is coupled with the duty to recognise his successor and an order made without recognising a successor is invalid the order of the President de recognising all the Rulers en masse amounted to arbitrary exercise of power and in any event the order was made for a collateral purpose that is to give effect to the policy of the Government after the Government was unable to secure the requisite majority in the <ORG> to the Constitution Amendment Bill is for the time being recognised by the President as the Ruler or if he is for the time being recognised by the President as the successor of the Ruler mentioned in part a The petitioner challenges the authority of the President by an order purporting to be made under Art Observations made in two judgments of this <ORG> on which the Attorney General relied do not support a contrary view That has however no bearing on the question in issue here Power of the President to determine the status of the Rulers by cancelling or withdrawing recognition to effectuate the policy of the Government to abolish the concept of Rulership is therefore liable to be challenged in these petitions <ORG> had the right of intervention in internal affairs which could be exercised for the benefit of the head of the state of India as a whole or for giving effect to international commitments The instruments of merger provided for the integration of <ORG>s and for transfer of power from the Princes and guaranteed to the Princes the privy purse succession to the gaddi rights and privileges and full ownership use and enjoyment of all private properties belonging to them as distinct from <ORG> properties In the case of the Provincially merged and Centrally administered <ORG>s authority for exercising the powers of administration and legislation originally derived from the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act was later exercisable by virtue of orders issued under ss A and incorporated in the Government of India Act with effect from January The power of the President is plainly coupled with a duty a duty to maintain the constitutional institution the constitutional provisions the constitutional scheme and the sanctity of solemn agreements entered into by the predecessor of <ORG> which are accepted recognised and incorporated in the Constitution The clause incorporates the history of momentous events which took place in India between and leaving a lasting impression upon our national and constitutional structure While there was recognition in the various announcements of the British Government of the fundamental fact that each State should link up its future with that Dominion with which it was geographically contiguous the Indian Independence Act re leased the States from all their obligations to the British Crown At the time the proposal was put forward to the Rulers an assurance was given to them that they would retain the status quo except for accession on these subjects It had been made clear to them that there was no intention either to encroach on the internal autonomy or the sovereignty of the States or to fetter their discretion in respect of their acceptance of the new Constitution of India There was nothing to compel or induce the Rulers to merge the identity of their States <ORG> resolved to honour without reservation the promises made to the Princes from time to time There are many analogous provisions in the Constitution which confer upon the President a power coupled with a duty We may refer to two such provisions If power to declare certain classes of citizens as belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes includes power to withdraw declaration without substituting a fresh declaration the President will be destroying the constitutional scheme Article before it was deleted by the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act defined Rajpramukh as mean ing a in relation to the State of Hyderabad the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Nizam of Hyderabad in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir or the State of Mysore the person who for the time being is recognized by the President as the Maharaja of that State and in relation to any other State specified in Part of the First Schedule the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Rajpramukh of that State and includes in relation to any of the said States any person for the time being recognised by the President as competent to exercise the powers of the Rajpramukh in relation to that State The first two clauses contemplated recognition of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the <NAME>s of Jammu Kashmir and of Mysore to be the Rajpramukh The Constitution in terms recognizes and accepts the obligation of the <ORG> to pay the privy purse to the Rulers charged the Attorney General invited our attention to different provisions of the Constitution in each of which there is both a charge oil <ORG> of an item of expenditure and an express direction for payment of the prescribed sum and contended that Art which merely recognizes the obligations of <ORG> to abide by the preexisting covenants creates no obligation for payment of the privy purse to the Rulers He urged that the word charge in the Constitution in dealing with State financial procedure has the meaning it has in accountancy practice it merely specifies the source from which payment is to be made and does not create a right in the Ruler or any en forceable obligation against the Union A charge gives a right to payment out of a specific fund or property and a right to prior payment but it does not create a right in rem in the fund or the pro perty In the absence of a clear indication to the contrary it would be difficult to hold that the expression charged used in the context of financial matters of the <ORG> has a different meaning Article merely uses the expression shall be charged in dealing with the grants in aid to the States of Assam Bihar Orissa and West Bengal without Any direction for payment Article deals with grants in aid to the revenues of such States as the <ORG> may determine it is only the provisions dealing with the capital and recurring sums which refer to the obligation to pay but in respect of these heads of expenditure there is no charge There are also other provisions in the Constitution which charge expenditure on the Consolidated Fund Art without any express provisions in the Constitution relating to payment The expression sums so paid to any Ruler does not mean sums if paid to any Ruler it means that sums when paid to any Ruler An imperfect obligation is used to describe a moral duty for instance a duty to pay a debt of honour or a debt barred by limitation but is properly left to the free will of him whose duty it is to discharge the obligation Article does not merely incorporate recognition of the obligation to pay the privy purse under covenants incurred by the Government of the Dominion of India it gives rise to a liability dehors the covenants In the case of <ORG> the liability to pay the privy purse to a head of State lay upon <ORG> to be discharged out of the revenues of the State Whereas the liability to pay the privy purse to the Rulers under the merger agreements was assured by <ORG> the Constitution imposed upon <ORG> a directive to pay the privy purse There is no such reservation in Art The cases of Doss supra and Salaman supra have therefore no application This Court held that by virtue of the agreement <ORG> was not deprived of its legislative power to impose taxes and on that account after the extension of the Income tax Act the exemption granted under the agree ment of must fall and that the Company was entitled only to such concessions as may be provided by the State law applicable thereto after the integration That Article imposes restrictions upon the exercise of legislative and executive functions is of the obligations under the original covenants and agreements executed by the Rulers barring those regarding which there is express legislation enacted to give effect to certain personal rights and privileges Wealth tax Act Gift tax Act notifications under the Sea Customs Act Code of Civil Procedure and Code of Criminal Procedure Subject to the power conferred in respect of certain matters of common interest to legislate and exercise executive authority the Princes had sovereignty within their territories Jurisdiction of the <ORG> in matters specified is excluded not because <ORG> is a successor to the paramountcy of the British <ORG> nor because the rights and obligations accepted and recognized by the Constitution may still be regarded as flowing from acts of State it is only excluded in respect of specific matters by the express provision in Art To accede to the claim that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> is barred in respect of whatever the executive asserts is valid is plainly to subvert the Rule of Law The <ORG> will interpret a statute as far as possible agreeably to justice and reason and that in case of two or more interpretations one which is more reasonable and just will be adopted for there is always a presumption against the law maker intending injustice and unreason In an avowedly democratic polity statutory provisions ensuring the security of fundamental human rights including the right to property will unless the contrary mandate be precise and unqualified be construed liberally so as to uphold the right It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the expression relating to in Art and refer to covenants the <ORG> have no jurisdiction to entertain disputes with respect to rights arising from those provisions It is the duty of the <ORG> to determine in what particular meaning and particular shade of meaning the word of expression was used by the Constitution makers and in discharging the duty the <ORG> will take into account the context in which it occurs the object to serve which it was used its collocation the general congruity with the concept or object it was intended to articulate and a host of other considerations If the constitutional provision relating to a covenant is the source of the right claimed to accrue or liability claimed to arise then clearly under the second limb the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain a dispute arising with respect to the right or obligation is barred But under the treaties covenants and agreements executed by the former Princes there was no provision for recognition of Rulers The Attorney General urged that this <ORG> has decided that the <ORG>s have no jurisdiction to determine whether the order of the President under Art The question as to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain a claim for payment of privy purse did not fall to be determined in <NAME> case supra Jurisdiction of the <ORG> will however not be excluded where the relief claimed is founded on a statutory provision enacted to give effect to personal rights under Art The <ORG> will give effect to the constitutional mandate if satisfied that the dispute arises out of any provision on of a covenant which is in force and was entered into or executed before the commencement of the Constitution and to which the predecessor of <ORG> was a party or that it is in respect of rights liabilities or obligations accruing or arising under any provision of the Constitution relating to a covenant A writ will therefore issue declaring that the order made by the President on September do recognising the Rulers is illegal and on that account inoperative and the petitioner will be entitled to all his preexisting rights and privileges including the right to the privy purse as if the order had not been made The petitioner will get his costs of the petition Each petitioner will get his costs of the petition of the Constitution in its present form deals with the rights and privileges of Rulers of Indian States other than the privy purse and reads In the exercise of the power of <ORG> or of the <ORG> of a State to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the <ORG> or of a State due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in article with respect to the personal rights privileges and dignities of the Ruler of an Indian State Clause of the article provides In this Constitution unless the context otherwise requires the following expressions have the meaning hereby respectively assigned to them that is to say Ruler in relation to an Indian State means the Prince Chief or other person by whom any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause of article was entered into and who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Ruler of the State and includes any person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler Clause of Art now deleted provided as follows Rajpramukh means a in relation to the state of Hyderabad the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Nizam of Hyderabad in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir or the State of Mysore the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Maharaja of that State and In relation to any other state specified in Part of the First Schedule the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Rajpramukh of that State and includes in relation to any of the said States any person for the time being recognised by the President as competent to exercise the powers of the Rajpramukh in relation to that State To complete the account of the provisions of the Constitution with regard to Rulers it is necessary to set out Art Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution but subject to the provisions of article neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument which was entered into or executed before the commencement of this Constitution by any Ruler of an Indian State and to which the Government of the Dominion of India or any of its predecessor Governments was a party and which has or has been con tinued in operation after such commencement or in any dispute in respect of any right accruing under or any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of this Constitution relating to such treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument We have to delve into the past history of India in order to appreciate the setting in which these persons or their ancestors who were formerly Rulers of territories in India wore brought within the fold of the Constitution <ORG> had no power to legislate for the <ORG> or their people The authors of the report visualised that the Provinces would ultimately become self governing units held together by a Central Government which would deal solely with matters of common concern to all of them There was a conference of ruling Princes and Chiefs in which recommended that the rulers of <ORG>s having full and unrestricted powers of civil and criminal jurisdiction in their <ORG>s and the power to make their own laws should be termed sovereign Princes as against those who lacked such powers There was a series of these conferences which debated on many and various points including <ORG> with the Provinces of British India The Government of India Act other than the Part relating to <ORG> came into force on the st April The Mission failed but its failure gave a new turn to India political struggle The Indian Independence Act enacted for the purpose of giving effect to the plan envisaged as above received the Royal Assent on th July Section of the Act defined what the territories of the two Dominions would be provided that the <ORG> of each of the new Dominions would have power to make laws for that Dominion Section empowered the Governor General to promulgate orders for making such provisions as appeared to him to be necessary or expedient for bringing the provisions of the Act into effective ope ration for dividing between the new Dominions and between the new Provinces to be constituted under the Act the powers rights property duties and liabilities of the Governor General in <ORG> etc The Instruments of Merger and the covenants establishing the various units of <ORG>s were in the nature of overall settlements with the <NAME> who had executed them Most of the historical account is taken verbatim from <NAME> Story of Integration of Indian States and the White Paper on Indian Constitution both of which were freely referred to by counsel appearing in the case Clause accept the matters specified in the Schedule hereto as the matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for the State VIII the <NAME> was to execute on behalf of the United State as soon as practicable and in any event not later than th June an Instrument of Accession in accordance with the provisions of of <ORG> Act and he was to accept as matters with respect to which <ORG> might make laws for the United State all the matters mentioned in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the said Act except the entries in List I relating to any tax or duty by such instrument The said amount was intended to cover all expenses of the Ruler and his family including expenses of his residence marriage and other ceremonies and subject to the provisions of paragraph I were neither to be increased nor reduced for any reason whatever Under paragraph the <NAME> was to cause the said amount to be paid to the Ruler in four equal instalments at the beginning of each quarter in advance By cl he assumed the obligation of ensuring that due effect was given to the provisions of the Act <ORG> Act within the United State so far as they were applicable by virtue of the Instrument of Accession Under cl it was made clear that nothing in the instrument was to be deemed too commit the United State in any way to acceptance of any future Constitution of India or to fetter the discretion of the Government of the United State to enter into arrangements with <ORG> under any such future Constitution As from that date <ORG> was to be competent to exercise the said powers and authority and jurisdiction in such manner and through such agency as it might think fit There were however departures from the above in some cases There was some similar provision in the cases of Mysore and Hyderabad but it is hardly necessary for the purpose of this series of petitions to go into the differences There were separate agreements with the <ORG> of Hyderabad regarding the privy purse private property and rights and privileges entered into on the th January As from that day <ORG> was to be competent to exercise the said powers authority and jurisdiction in such manner and through such agency as it might think fit lakhs would be paid to the <NAME> in four equal installments in advance The States Merger Governors Provinces Order was promulgated on the th July under A of the <ORG> of India Act for the administration of the States specified in the Schedule together with the adjoining Governors Provinces Under Cl the States specified in each of the Schedules were to be administered as from the appointed day in all respects as if they formed part of the Provinces specified in the heading of that Schedule and accordingly any reference to an Acceding State in the <ORG> of India Act or in any Act or Ordinance made on or after the appointed day was to be construed as not including a reference to any of the merged States and any reference in any such Act or Ordinance as aforesaid to Provinces specified in that Schedule Under Cl all the law in force in a merged State or in any part thereof immediately before the appointed day including orders made under section or section of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act was to continue in force until repealed modified or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority Under Cl all property wherever situate which immediately before the appointed day was vested in <ORG> for purposes of the governance of a merged State was as from that date to vest in the <ORG> of the absorbing Province unless the purposes for which the property was held immediately before the appointed daywere central purposes A portion of his speech is quoted as below In the past in most of the <ORG> there was no distinction between the expenditure on the administration and the Ruler privy purse At the time the proposal was put forward to the <NAME> an assurance was given to them that they would retain the status quo except for accession on these subject There was nothing to compel or induce the <NAME> to merge the identity of their <ORG> The <ORG> will also remember that there are a few articles in the Constitution specifically A the present Art where there are references to these agreements covenants sanads etc Practically all the States have come within the scope of Part VI A and they will be governed by the provisions of this Constitution and excepting so far as certain commitments are positively mentioned in the Constitution and as I said the two Articles A and A the covenants will by and large not affect the working of the Constitution and it is therefore necessary in view of the vast powers that have been conceded in this Constitution to the judiciary that anything that has occurred before the passing of this Constitution and which might incidentally be operatable after the passing of the Constitution must not be a subject matter of a dispute in a court of law There was also some discussion with regard to the definition of Ruler and Rajpramukh which figured in Art It had no other reference at all He also said that the expression was deliberately used in order to give the power of recognition to the President The Constitution contains no substantive provision conferring on the President a right to recognise or not to recognise a Ruler or to withdraw recognition The right to receive privy purse and other rights of Rulers constitute property within the meaning of Art vii There was a duty cast upon <ORG> to respect and implement the provisions of the Merger agreements and the Covenants covered cases of a dispute arising out of a settlement with a Ruler or a dispute in respect of a right or obligation founded on a provision of the Constitution relating to such a settlement but it did not cover the case of policy embodied in legislative or administrative action to abolish altogether the institution of Rulership and its rights and privileges and of privy purses of the Constitution declaring the Order dated th September to be unconstitutional ultra vires and void and further to quash the Order a writ direction or order declaring that the petitioner continues to be the Ruler and continues to be entitled to the privy purse and to his personal rights and privileges as a Ruler a writ direction or order directing <ORG> to continue to pay the privy purse to the petitioner and to continue to recognise the Rulership and the personal rights and privileges of the petitioner and to implement and observe the provisions of the covenant Merger agreement entered into with the petitioner of the Constitution this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition The power included the power to recognise and the power to cease to recognise any person as a Ruler There was no provision in the Constitution which conferred on the petitioner or any of the erstwhile rulers any rights to be recognised as Ruler and continues to be recognised as such or to privy purse or any of the privileges The petitioner has no fundamental right as claimed and Art The article being a Code to the meaning of the words used in the Con stitution we have to see exactly what it proposes to do and what it achieves The expression for the time being was not inserted for the purpose of giving power to the president to recognise a person or withdraw recognition from him as his fancy dictated read with the rules of succession in the Merger agreements and the covenants was given full effect That is the assurance which was given to the Rulers when they accepted the Constitution and I see no reason why the Constitution should be interpreted in a way to set that In the course of the judgment of this Court there is an observation at reading The effect of the Merger Agreement is clearly one by which factually a Ruler of an Indian State ceases to be a Ruler but for the purpose of the Constitution and for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed he is a Ruler as defined in Art There is nothing in the provisions of Art Reference may be usefully made to paragraph at page of the White Paper on Indian States under the heading Recognition of Rulers reading The Rulers of the merged and integrated States have been guaranteed succession according to law and custom There was a WI it petition to this court as also an appeal from a judgment of <ORG> which were dealt with by a common judgment of this Court The contentions put forward on behalf of the petitioner the appellant to this <ORG> were The handing over or authorising the taking over of pri vate properties was by executive flat and was ex facie bad as infringing Art If there was any power to recognise the Ruler it was an arbitrary and unguided power and infringing the fundamental right to property and As there was no dispute regarding the covenant inasmuch as succession did not arise out of the covenant Art There was no statement that the Rulership had lapsed In cases where there is no dispute about the amount of the privy purse no question of any reference to the covenant arises read along with the first makes it clear that the whole object is to prevent disputes arising from covenants being raised in the garb of enforcing a right conferred by a provision of the Constitution does not apply since there is no dispute as to rights arising from the covenant and the constitutional provisions merely guarantee that right The power or jurisdiction cannot avail an authority to make an order or decision which is malafide and ultra vires because such an order or decision is a nullity and the bar of jurisdiction under Art It did not create any new and independent right unrelated to the covenant which gave constitutional guarantee to those demands embodied constitutional sanction for the due fulfilment of <ORG> guarantees and assurances in respect of privy purses It does not by itself create an independent right in the recipient In my view it is not necessary to examine all the contentions raised for and against the petitioner for the final conclusion to be arrived at As <NAME> put it The privy purses and the guarantee as to personal rights and privileges was the quid pro quo for the parting of their powers and their huge States by the <NAME> and was the minimum which could be afforded to them Sup CI <NAME> speaking in said that human memory was proverbially short and that in October people might not remember what had taken place in the years preceding namely the tremendous upheaval in the country since and the possibility of the <NAME> taking sides with States or peoples not favourably disposed towards India Only twenty years have passed since then too short a period to sweep overboard all that took place during the memorable years preceding the commencement of the Constitution at the sacrifice of the interests of fairly large number of persons who had helped to consolidate India in a manner far different from anything that had taken place in the past Ac cording to Mr <NAME> who referred to some of the financial provisions in the Constitution a security was created thereby on <ORG> that there was something akin to a pledge of it for the payment of the privy purse giving rise to a new right Save for the power of the President to refer a matter to this <ORG> for its opinion under Art covered by Part III i the fundamental rights to move this <ORG> Whenever a person asserts or claims a right in respect of a subject matter and another person contradicts it or denies it there is a dispute A question of law may arise about the interpretation of a contract equally it may arise about the interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution The right liability or obligation in dispute must arise out of the provisions of the Constitution which has any bearing on any treaty agreement covenant engagement etc Article has come up for consideration before this <ORG> in a number of cases and reference has been made to this article quite frequently in several decision Among the contentions urged there was one that the suit which was filed before the th January stood transferred to <ORG> under Art If the plaintiff has a grievance and a right to a relief which the defendants contend it has not the forum to seek redress is not the <ORG> exercising its original jurisdiction on the transfer of the suit from the Federal <ORG> One of the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant was the the privy purse was a political pension within the meaning of of the Civil Procedure Code and as such protected from the execution proceedings Relying upon the decisions of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> of Murshidabad <ORG> Ltd the Court came to the conclusion that privy purses were political pensions With all respect it appears to me that all the above was not strictly necessary for the decision of the case and it would have been enough to say that privy purse was a pension a word which according to the Oxford Dic tionary means a periodical payment made specially by a Go vernment company employer etc To support this plea under this head he referred to a fairly large number of decisions of this Court where it had been held that than an order which was a nullity or which was malafide or ultra vires would not stand in the way of the exercise of juris diction of a court of law to strike it down The power exercised the Government in that case rested on service rules the proper application of which is always subject to scrutiny by courts of law Examining the content of the power vested in the Government to pass the impugned orders the Court observed that the use of that power for achieving an alien purpose wreaking the ministers vengeance on the officer would be mala fide and a colourable exercise of that power and would therefore be struck down by the Courts The petitions had been dismissed by <ORG> on the ground that the Presidential Order which had been issued under Art If in challenging the validity of this detention order the detenu is pleading any right outside the rights specified in the Order his right to move any court in that behalf is not suspended because it is outside Art A A A The observation amounts to saying that the Presidential Order suspending the right to move a court of law can only apply within the proper ambit of the President power and the same cannot be used by the executive as a cloak to shield any misuse of that power The third case <NAME> State was one in which the petitioner moved this Court under Art If a person under colour of exercising the statutory power acts from some improper or ulterior motive he acts in bad faith Courts have always acted to restrain a misuse of statutory power and the more readily when improper motives underlie The provision of law which came up for consideration there was the Defence of India Rules and his Lordship laid down that powers given by such rules could be used only within the limits prescribed lm Subject to any order passed under sub section no suit shall without the permission of the District Magistrate be filed in any Civil Court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds Sub section enabled the party aggrieved by the order of the District Magistrate to go up in revision to the Commissioner and section provided for revisional powers to the State Government very wide terms was a case in which a suit was filed by the respondent to recover the excess amount collected from them under protest by levying duty upon a tariff and not an ad valorem basis The main question for determination in the appeal was whether the order passed by the Collector of <ORG> under the provisions of of the Sea <ORG> Act against the assessment of duty by the officer of <ORG> and which was subsequently affirmed on revision under the provisions of of the Act constituted a final adjudication or whether the civil courts had jurisdiction to entertain the suit of the respondents Section provided that every order passed in appeal under this section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by section be final Hawkesford approved by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> and adopted on the basis of these decisions the dictum that Where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it It is also well settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not beep complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure The argument for the appellant was that an assessment was not made under the Act if it gave effect to a provision which was ultra vires the Indian Legislature and that in law such a provision was a nullity and non existent The <ORG> held that there was ample provision in the Income tax Act by which an assessee could question the validity of any taxing provision in the statute which provided effective and proper machinery for review on grounds of law of any assessment Referring to <ORG> case supra and <ORG> case supra it was said that Both these cases thus appear to be decided on the basis of provisions in the relevant Acts for the correction modification and setting aside of assessments and the express bar of the jurisdiction of the civil courts The presence of a section barring the jurisdiction was the main reason and the existence of an adequate machinery for the same relief was the supplementary reason The result of the enquiry into the views expressed by this Court in a large number of cases was summed up at pages in seven propositions If the dispute is so covered the court is precluded from examining whether the contention of the party asserting a right was genuine or of real substance I have taken the view that the President power or right or duty or obligation to recognise a person as a Ruler arises not merely out of the provisions in Art was inserted for the Purpose of giving a quietus to any dispute which anyone might seek to raise on the basis of covenants and Merger agreements or rights flowing therefrom I also take the opportunity of remarking that if ever there was an occasion for the President to make a reference to this <ORG> the present was eminently suited to the purpose No body of persons known to law can be called an institution of Rulers According to the figures given by Mr <NAME> himself Rulership of I would leave the parties to bear their own costs For pronouncing on the questions arising for decision it is sufficient if I refer to the facts pleaded in any one of the cases After the Constitution of India came into force the President recognised the father of the petitioner under Art They had only such rights and privileges as were recognized or created under the Covenants entered into by them with <ORG> and those embodied in the Constitution Consequently the Government moved in <ORG> on September the Constitution Twenty fourth Amendment Bill to delete certain provisions of the Constitution relating to the guarantees given to the Rulers about their privy purses as well as privileges It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that in exercise of his powers under Art and of the Constitution as well as under various statutory provisions or rules having the force of law are fundamental rights and as such they cannot be abolished by an executive order It is contended that the respondent has right to abolish Rulership in exercise of its power under Art the plea taken by the respondent is that it confers no legal right on the Rulers The respondent takes the stand that this <ORG> cannot go into the scope or effect of Art So far as the Covenants and Agreements are concerned it is urged on its behalf that the rights liabilities or obligations arising therefrom are outside the jurisdiction of this <ORG> firstly SUP It is next contended on behalf of the respondent that neither under the Covenants nor under any of the provisions of the Constitution any fundamental right was conferred on any Ruler and hence the petition under Art It is also urged on behalf of the respondent that Art From the pleadings the following issues arise for decision What is the scope of Cl of Art Does it confer on the President power to abolish Rulership Are the impugned orders invalid for any of the reasons mentioned in the Writ Petitions Does Art After World War when it became inevitable for <ORG> to grant freedom to this country the question as to the future relationship of the Indian States with the Dominion of India assumed importance As there was no agreement between the concerned parties <ORG> under the Independence Act divided the then British India into two parts India and Pakistan There was an imminent threat to the unity of India politically as well as economically But it was said on behalf of the respondent that the <NAME> merged their <ORG>s in the Dominion out of sheer necessity and not out of any patriotism they were not in a position to resist the compulsion of geography and pressure of their subjects in favour of self Government and therefore they merely made a virtue of necessity <NAME> told <ORG> on October There was nothing to compel or induce the <NAME> to merge the identity of their <ORG>s The respondent in its counter affidavit has taken the stand that the people of this country having become conscious of their social This <ORG> is not the forum for going into these issues nor is it concerned with the political passions surrounding the issues arising for decision in this case It is also not for this <ORG> except to the extent it bears on the question of interpretation of the Constitution to go into the historical background of any constitutional provision But if there is any ambiguity in interpreting the same it is The petitioners deny that there is any such public opinion It may be noted that no Indian State as such exists after the Constitution came into force This is made clear by the expression for the time being is recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler such Ruler being the Ruler referred to in the first limb of the clause That power is no doubt an executive power but the same has to be exercised in accordance with law In other words it has to be exercised as a quasi judicial power can only come into play if there was any error in locating the person who entered into the Covenant or Agreement the condition for the recognition being that the person recognised must be the person who entered into the Covenant or Agreement The power to recognise given to His Majesty under this section is blanket power It was urged on behalf of the respondent that a power to recognise includes a power not to recognise Evidently this contention is based on of the General Clauses Act which Says Where by any Central Act or Regulation a power to issue notifications orders rules or bye laws is conferred then that power includes a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions if any to add to amend vary or rescind any notifications orders rules or bye laws so issued So far as the recognition of the successor of that Ruler is concerned in case of dispute it becomes the duty of the President to decide as to who is the successor of the Ruler who executed the Covenant or Agreement at the relevant time Despite the fact that exclusive power was given to the President to recognise the successor of the original Ruler the procedure that invariably adopted in case of disputed succession was to act on the basis of the recommendation of either of a <ORG> judge who had inquired into the matter or of a committee presided over by a <ORG> judge set up for that purpose In other words the power conferred on the President under that provision is one coupled with duty There are similar powers conferred on the President under the Constitution and would have become inoperative and the constitutional guarantees given to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes would have become meaningless Now coming to the contention that power to recognise the Rulers includes power not to recognise we shall test the correctness of that contention with reference to some other Articles in the Constitution which deal with certain constitutional duties of the President Therefore the argument advanced on behalf of the respondent that the power to recognise the Ruler includes within itself the Power not to recognise is clearly a fallacious one We were told that there was one instance of derecognition of a recognised Ruler namely that of the former Ruler of Baroda The impugned orders are also unconstitutional for the reason that the power conferred under Art is exercised for a collateral purpose As seen earlier power to recognise <NAME> was conferred for the purpose of implementing some of the provisions of the Constitution and not for denuding the contents of those provisions of the Consti tution which directs the President that the executive power of the <ORG> shall be exercised by him either directly or through the officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution It has no competence to exercise the executive power in violation of the mandates given by the onstitution requires the executive that due regard should be given to the guarantees and assurances given under the Agreements or Covenants entered into with the former Rulers of the Indian States It was urged on behalf of the petitioners that the members of the cabinet who advised the President to issue the impugned orders were bound by their oath to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution but they have shown scant respect for their oath treating the same as a mere formality they have thereby not only broken their oath but have damaged the Constitution as well It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the im pugned orders were made in exercise of the political power of the State which according to it is an incident of the sovereignty there was dispute as regards his successor This Court came to the conclusion that under the circumstances of that case the decision of the President was not open to challenge There is nothing like a political power under our Constitution in the matter of relationship between the executive and the citizens Earlier I have in a general way referred to some of the political events that took place in the years to In order to consider some of the contentions raised by the Counsel for the parties relating to the scope and effect of Art Very soon after the execution of the Instruments of Accession other developments took place in quick I succession In some of the Merger Agreements rights were also created in favour of the third parties such as guaranteeing the continuity of the services of the permanent members of the Public Service of those <ORG>s as well as the payment of pensions due to the retired civil servants In several of the Merger Agreements it is provided that if there was any dispute as to whether a particular item of property is the private property of the Ruler or the property of the <ORG> that dispute was to be decided by an authority to be appointed as provided in those agreements IV of the Merger Agreement provided that the income derived annually from the share of the Nawab in the original investment by <NAME> in the Bhopal <ORG> Railway which share was agreed to be Rupees five lakhs and fifty five thousand shall be treated as the personal income of the Nawab and shall be paid by <ORG> to the Nawab and his successors Under the Merger Agreement entered into by the Maharaja of Manipur he was given a right to the use of the Residences known as Redlands and Les Chatalettes in Shillong and the property in the town of Gauhati known as Manipuri Basti though all those properties were considered as the <ORG> properties It may be noted that this Order was made long before the Constitution came into force From the foregoing it is seen that before the Constitution came into force the liability to pay the privy purses to several of the <ORG> whose States had directly merged with the Dominion of India became that of some of the Provinces and ceased to be that of the Dominion of India We may further note that under the Merger Agreements there were several other rights created either in favour of the concerned <ORG> or in favour of the third parties There were provisions in those covenants for the formation of <ORG> to aid and advise the <ORG> in the exercise of some of his functions They were also given a right to nominate some members to some of the statutory Boards From the foraging it is seen that under the various covenants several rights in addition to the right of receiving privy purses had been created in favour of the Rulers of some of the covenanting States In the draft Constitution there were no articles similar to Arts Sometime before October <ORG> which was instrumental in bringing about the merger of the States with <ORG> wrote to the drafting committee that the guarantees given to the Rulers in regard to privy purses should be given constitutional section of the Constitution as it now stands after its amendment by the th Amendment Act reads Where under any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of this Constitution the payment of any sums free of tax has been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India to any Ruler of such State as privy purse a such sums shall be charged on and paid out of <ORG> and the sums so paid to any Ruler shall be exempt from all taxes on income has four principal ingredients namely the conditions giving rise to the liability to pay the privy purses charging of the privy purses payable on the Consolidated Fund of India the payment of the same from out of the Consolidated Fund and the sums so paid to any Ruler to be exempt from all taxes on income He asserts that the right created in favour of the <NAME> is enforceable in court of law merely recognizes the obligation undertaken by the Dominion of India either under the Merger Agreements or under the Covenants and it does not create any new right or obligation merely refers to the Fund out of which the payment is to be made and not that it should be paid to any person The liability to pay privy purses to the <NAME> who entered into Covenants for forming unions was that of the concerned union and not that of the Dominion of India came into force there is no legal relationship between the Covenants and Agreements and that Article That Article read with Article constitute a self contained code in the matter of payment of privy purses If an item of expenditure charged on the consolidated fund merely means that that expenditure is non votable then there was no need to provide in Art From the passage quoted above from the Dictionary of English law by <NAME> it is seen that as soon as an item of expenditure is charged on the consolidated fund the said act creates a legal obligation to pay out of the consolidated fund that item of expenditure to the person for whose benefit the charge is created Therefore there is no question of pointing out the fund from out of which the payment is to be made from the date the Constitution came into force We are told that as a fact most of the <ORG> who entered into the Covenants and Agreements were recognised only in the year but yet they were being paid the amounts agreed to be paid as privy purses ever since the Constitution came into force and the privileges guaranteed to them were also extended to them even before they were recognised Similarly we were told that in the case of successors of the <ORG> when there was no dispute as to succession they were treated as <ORG> for all purposes though they were recognised several months after they succeeded to the <NAME> A constitutional provision is not to be interpreted by taking words of the provisions in the one hand and the dictionary in the other or by taking the meaning given in a decision to a word in different setting If the mandates contained in these Articles are unenforceable these Articles can only have ornamental value shows that there is a direction to pay the privy purses to <NAME> <ORG> merely wanted to give some sort of assurance to the <NAME> about the payment of privy purses to them in future so as to allay their apprehensions that may not be paid privy purses in future but in reality no legal right was created in favour of the <NAME> nor any binding obligation imposed on <ORG> Further there was nor purpose in charging the privy purses on the <ORG> fund or giving a constitutional exemption from payment of all taxes on income in respect of privy purse It was felt that if the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the impugned orders are valid orders then there is an end of the matter The learned Attorney General repeatedly made it plain to us that even if we come to the conclusion that the impugned orders are invalid the privy purses will not be paid by the Government unless we hold that the right given to the <NAME> under Art This is a strange stand particularly in view of the fact that even according to him the Constitution has recognised the liability to pay the privy purses to the <NAME> and the obligation in question has received constitutional sanction We have to proceed on the basis that the learned Attorney General made that submission on the strength of the instructions received by him from the respondent But yet it is difficult to believe that the executive which is a creture of the Constitution whose head the President and the members of the cabinet had taken the oath of allegiance to the Constitution would take the stand that they will not respect a mandate of the Constitution unless that mandate is enforceable in a court of law I doubt whether the grave implications of the stand taken on behalf of the Government have been realised That Article reads In the exercise of the power of <ORG> or of the legislature of a State to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the <ORG> or of a State due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in article with respect to the personal rights privileges and dignities of the Ruler of an Indian State can be best considered when a proper case comes up for decision That Article reads Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution but subject to the provisions of article neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument which was entered into or executed before the commencement of this Constitution by any Ruler of an Indian State and to which the Government of the Dominion of India or any of its predecessor Governments was a party and which has or has been continued in operation after such commencement or in any dispute in respect of any right accruing under or any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of this Constitution relating to any such treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument Guarantees have been given to the Rulers under the various Agreements and Covenants for the continuation of their rights dignities and privileges Article has there fore been embodied in the Constitution which excludes specifically the Agreements of Merger and the Covenants from the jurisdiction of Courts except in cases which may be refered to <ORG> by the President which provides that in the exercise of their legislative and executive authority the legislative and executive organs of the Union and States will have due regard to the guarantees given to the Rulers with respect to their personal rights privileges and dignities But according to the learned Attorney General that article excludes from the jurisdiction of all courts including this <ORG> not merely those matters that fall within the scope of Art Therefore it is a matter that falls within the scope of Art If it is otherwise there was no need to enact Art Further there was no purpose in guaranteeing the payment of privy purses under Art If the contention advanced on behalf of the respondent is correct the purpose of Art For the purpose of giving necessary direction to the <ORG> and <ORG> executives as well as to the <ORG> and <ORG> legislatures the Constitution recognised the rights accruing and liabilities and obligations arising under various Agreements and Covenants which recognition made Evidently there were other reasons also for enacting Art The jurisdiction of this <ORG> as well as of other courts is clearly barred in respect of disputes falling within that part it must receive a narrower meaning otherwise all rights accruing or liabilities and obligations arising under one of other of the provisions of the Constitution to the former Rulers of Indian States as well as to their subjects has to be held to come within the mischief of Art It has nothing to do with the Agreements and Covenants The power to recognise the Rulers is a new power conferred on the President by the Constitution There was no such power under the Agreements and Covenants Between and th of January there was no question of recognising the Rulers of Indian States The basic issue arising for decision in these cases is of far greater significance than it appears at first sight Before proceeding to consider the decisions relied on by the learned Attorney General and Mr <NAME> in support of their contention that the disputes with which we are concerned in these cases are disputes falling within the ambit of Art Hence there was no occasion for this <ORG> or for that matter any court in this country to consider the scope of Art It is true that there are a few observations in some of the decisions to which I shall presently refer about the nature of the right guaranteed under that Art Let me now consider the decisions relied on by the learned Attorney General of the Constitution after the Constitution came ino force is court had no jurisdiction to hear the suits One of the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner in that case was that by the terms of the Merger Agreement the properties concerned in that case were declared as the petitioner private properties and were protected from State legislation by the guarantee given under Art The Court rejected that contention with these observations It is true that by the covenant of merger the properties of the petitioner became his private properties as distinguished from properties of the <ORG> but in respect of them he is in no better position than any other owner possessing private property The guarantee contained in the article is of a limited extent only Moreover it seems to me that in view of the comprehensive language of article this issue is not justiciable He contended that in view of the guarantees given to him under cls But the learned Attorney General relied on the observations found at pp In the very nature of things it is not possible to give the same attention to incidental matters as is given to the actual issues arising for decision This question need not detain us for long I have earlier come to the conclusion that the right to get the privy purse under Art There is no need at present to go into the other reliefs asked for Thirdly there is no substantive provision in the Constitution Fifthly the right to receive privy purse and other rights constitutes property within Articles and and the order seeks to deprive the petitioner of his right to privy purse and other rights in violation of Article The Government denies that the Government has no right to refuse to pay privy purse or to derecognise Rulers The Government denies that the order is ultra vires or there is any institution of <ORG> Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution but subject to the provisions of Article neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument which was entered into or executed before the commencement of this Constitution by any Ruler of an Indian State and to which the Government of the Dominion of India or any of its predessor Governments was a party and which has or has been continued in operation after such commencement or in any dispute in respect of any right accruing under or any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of this Constitution relating to any such treaty agreement covenant engagement sanad or other similar instrument The first bar is in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty agreement covenant entered into before the commencement of the Constitution and which has continued in operation after such commencement It is therefore vitally necessary to ascertain first whether there are disputes secondly as to what those disputes are and thirdly whether the disputes fall within Article Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioner contended that there was no dispute as to privy purse or to recognition of a Ruler and the only contention was that the order of the President was a nullity Mr <NAME> contended that the first limb of Article was clearly not applicable because there is no dispute arising out of any Covenant or Merger Agreement and the bar under the second limb was not attracted for four reasons Secondly it was said that Articles and are mandatory Articles and if the Government chose to raise disputes about those Articles it would amount to saying that the Government was disputing the very obligation enacted by those Articles in the Constitution In order to appreciate the true scope and content of Article it is necessary to find out as to why this Article and Articles hereinafter referred to collectively as the allied Articles found place in the Constitution It is in this background that <ORG> declared in May that paramountcy of the British <ORG> which provided the basis of relations between British India and the Rulers of Indian States could neither be retained by the British <ORG> nor transferred to the new <ORG> There were Indian States whereof merged in Provinces were taken over as centrally administered areas and integrated in different <ORG> of States There were differences in the Merger Agreements as to the amount of privy purse and in some cases as to the rights of successors to Rulers with regard to privy purses The Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act was therefore passed in the year giving power to the Central Government to exercise extra provincial jurisdiction over a Provincially merged or a Centrally merged State only if the <ORG> had by treaty agreement acquired full and exclusive authority and jurisdiction and power for and in relation to the governance of the State Under the said section A there came into existence the <ORG> Merger Governors Provinces Order issued on July Under the <ORG> Merger Governors Provinces Order the provincially merged <ORG> were to be administered in all respects as if they formed part of the absorbing Provinces and all laws including orders made under the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act were to continue in force until repealed or modified A similar order known as the <ORG> Merger Chief Commissioners Provinces Order was made applicable to the centrally merged <ORG> with effect from August that <ORG> cancelled the right this <ORG> held that the right granted by the Ruler was not recognised before and the Constitution gave support to those rights which were extant on January That is why Article really embodied the principles of Acts of State which regulated and guided the rights and obligations under the covenants or merger agreements by incorporating the doctrine of unenforceability of covenants or merger agreements coming into existence as Acts of State A question was posed that if there were rights as to succession privy purse and privileges there should be a remedy In the first place there are no legal rights to recognition of Rulership payment of privy purse and enjoyment of rights and privileges The Constitution gave recognition to guarantees under covenants and agreements by the allied Articles and it has been held that the recognition of rulership by the President is not an indicia of property but it entitles the Rulers to the enjoyment of Privy Purse contemplated in Article and the personal rights privileges and dignities mentioned in Article of the Constitution It was also held that the recognition of rulership by the President was an executive and political power and Article constitutes a bar to interference by courts in a dispute arising by reason of recognition of rulership Mr <NAME> submitted that there was no political power of the President who had only executive power Article was construed to mean that the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Article to interfere in regard to rejection of a nomination paper could not be challenged by a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings This Court observed the difference between the words subject to the provisions of this Constitution occurring in Article and notwithstanding anything in this Constitution occurring in Article and held that the words in Article could not exclude the jurisdiction of <ORG> In that case section of <ORG> Advocates Act provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the Bar Councils Act or in any other law regulating the conditions subject to which a person not entered in the roll of Advocates of <ORG> might be permitted to practise in <ORG> every Advocate of <ORG> shall be entitled as of right to practise in any High Court whether or not he is an Advocate of <ORG> He made an application under Article There was an appeal as well as a writ petition under Article It was Id that section of the Government of India Act conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal <ORG> in any dispute In the present case the dispute is whether the President has or has not the power to make the order impugned in these proceedings The next question Which falls for consideration is the meaning of the words right accruing under any liability or obligation arising out of any of the provisions of the Constitution The contention of the petitioner that the President has no power under Article to make an order for derecognition is a right asserted by the petitioner under the provisions of the Constitution and it is also the petitioner contention that the President has no right arising out of Article not to make an order of derecognition Ordinarily the word relate means to bring a thing or person in relation to another to connect establish a relation between to have reference to to be related having relation to and to stand in some relation to another thing Recognition of a Ruler was necessary for the limited purpose of payment out of privy purse and it had no other reference It cannot be said that there is any right to <ORG> because the Constitution does not enact that there shall be Rulers or that the President shall recognise Rulers There is no legal enforceable right to recognition under the co ant No legal right to <ORG>hip arises under Article either If there were legal right Article would have said that a Ruler means the Prince by whom any covenant was entered into and who shall be recognised by the President as a Ruler Without recognition of Ruler under Articles no effect can be given to payment of privy purse guaranteed in the covenants and agreements When counsel for the petitioner submitted that the order of the President was intended to abolish the concept of <ORG>hip he was reading into the Constitution a permanent constitutional mandate for continuance of <ORG> under the rubric of recognition of <ORG> Inasmuch as there is no legal right to recognition it makes no difference whether there is derecognition of one Ruler or derecognition of all the <ORG> It was said that there is no power of derecognition This Court has held in the <NAME> case supra that there is power to derecognise If the petitioner challenges the power of the President to derecognise him he claims that he has a right to continue as a Ruler which is a right related to covenants The President in recognising a Ruler need not follow law of succession and above all there is no legal obligation on the President to appoint a Ruler Mr <NAME> relied on the decisions of this <ORG> as also the recent decision of <ORG> in support of the proposition that if the order was a nullity there was no bar of jurisdiction The jurisdiction of the courts of Law in those cases is ousted until the statutory process has been completed except in so far as the courts may prohibit the <ORG> from proceeding on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to determine a particular matter In situations where the courts have no jurisdiction to intervene they may nevertheless review the validity of the final determination by the chosen <ORG> either on the ground that the authority was not the one designated by the Act or where it was empowered to determine an issue it did not address itself to the matter committed to it or where it violated the rule of natural justice <ORG> of any application made to them under the Act was not to be called in question in any court of law The ratio of the decision of <ORG> was not whether the Foreign Compensation <ORG> made a wrong decision but whether the <ORG> enquired into and decided a matter which they had no right to consider In the present case the question for consideration is the provision of the Constitution which under some Articles confer jurisdiction on this <ORG> and in another Article excludes the jurisdiction of the <ORG> In ordinary statues statutory authorities are entrusted with powers and duties The fallacy of the petitioner submission is in totally overlooking the provisions of Article which exclude in express and unambiguous terms the jurisdiction of this <ORG> notwithstanding any provision of the Constitution The courts normally leap in favour of stretching the jurisdiction but when the Constitution which invests this <ORG> with jurisdiction with one hand divests it of jurisdiction with another in specifically designated disputes the attempt to overreach the Article which bars jurisdiction of courts will be totally impermissible Therefore if the Constitution has placed a restriction on the jurisdiction of this <ORG> it will he trifling and tinkering with the Constitution if this <ORG> interfered in matters which were excluded from jurisdiction In interpretting these four allied Articles when this <ORG> finds that it has no jurisdiction it will say so and in saying so the jurisdiction of this <ORG> is not whistled down in any manner It is now to be found out whether there are disputes with regard to payment of privy purses and whether such disputes can be said to arise out of the provisions of this Constitution and thirdly Whether the provisions of the Constitution in Article relate to covenants and merger agreements Mr <NAME> contended that there were no disputes as to payment of privy purses The petitioner claim in the petition to continue to be recognised a Ruler is for the purpose of payment of privy purse When there has been an order of recognition of a Ruler the Ruler then becomes en titled to payment of privy purse and enjoyment of other rights and privileges mentioned in Articles and respectively For days there were discussions debates and disputes at the <ORG> as to whether there were disputes as to privy purses The pleading and the affidavit evidence point with unerring accuracy that the petitioners claim privy purse assert title to privy purse and insist on payment of privy purse guaranteed in covenants and merger agreements and recognised in Article and by reason of provisions contained in Article which speaks of recognition of Rulers they ask for relief with regard to continuance of recognition of Rulers and payment of privy purses Article as it stood at the time of the commencement of the Constitution indicated that where territories of any Indian State are comprised within a State specified in Part A or Part of the First Schedule there shall be charged that in order to give constitutional recognition to the guarantees and assurances under the Covenants and Merger Agreement Articles proviso and were incor porated in the Constitution When the Constitution came into force the guarantee for the payment of the sums of money as privy purse contained in the Covenants and Agreements was continued by Article but the esential political character of the privy purse was pre served by Article by enacting that the guarantee could not be enforced in municipal courts It was said on behalf of the petitioner that the words charged on and paid out of the consolidated fund in Article meant that a security was created in favour of the petitioner in respect of privy purse and therefore a new and independent right was created If payment has not been guaranteed under the covenants or merger agreements Article does not come into operation at all It will be utterly wrong to equate the words charged on the consolidated fund with a charge by way of security because Article only gives effect to guarantees in the covenants and agreements by charging the payment on the consolidated Fund The words charged on and paid out of the consolidated fond in Article mean that the sum shall not be submitted to the vote of <ORG> and Article makes a provision to that effect The reason is that there is no vested legal right in praosenti in favour of a Ruler There is no right either in rem or in personam in favour of a Ruler in regard to payment of privy purse After the Constitution came into existence the same system continued for presentation of the Annual Financial Statement under Article and Appropriation Bill under Article Article says that so much of the estimates as relates to expenditure charged upon the consolidated fund shall not be submitted to the vote of <ORG> but there is nothing to prevent discussion in either House of <ORG> of any of those estimates No such comparable words are to be found in Article namely that the sums shall be paid to the <NAME> Secondly these persons hold offices under the Constitution whereas the <NAME> do not In the case of the President the Chairman the Deputy Chairman of <ORG> the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of <ORG> Articles and provide that there shall be paid to them such allowances and salaries as may be fixed by <ORG> by law and until the provision in that behalf is so made such salaries and allowances as are specified in the Second Schedule As for the Judges of this Court Article enacts that there shall be paid to the Judges of this Court such salaries as are specified in the Second Schedule It was said on behalf of the petitioner that in the covenants and merger agreements the payment of privy purse was to be free of all taxes whereas under the Constitution privy purse was to be exempt free of all taxes on income and therefore there was a new right The words so paid relate to the slum guaranteed under the covenants and the agreements and to the same sum charged on <ORG> It is only when payment is made to a Ruler that it shall be exempt from taxes on income That is why the words so paid to any Ruler in Article indicate that when the sums are paid to a Ruler out of <ORG> the sums shall be exempt from all taxes Article does not create any new and independent right but it merely gives constitutional recognition to guarantees under covenants and merger agreements which Were and are unenforceable as those arise out of Acts of State Another argument was advanced on behalf of the petitioner that there was a substitution of rights under covenants and merger agreements by Article This Article gives effect to the covenants and agreements and it is related to these There were some arguments that if the amount charged on the consolidated fund on account of privy purse were not paid the same would be carried over in <ORG> from year to year Mr <NAME> contended that the petitioner had existing rights to privy purge and privileges prior to the Constitution and that such existing rights were incorporated in the Constitution by Articles and of the Constitution The <ORG>s Merger Governors Provinces Order stated that as from the appointed day i the date of the com mencement of the order August the <ORG>s specified in the Schedule shall be administered in all respects as if they form part of the provinces specified in the heading of the Schedule Therefore Articles and can have no application to privy purses and Privileges This political bargain was carried into the Constitution by the insertion of Article for payment of privy purse Article for continuance of privileges and Article for recognition of princes and the political character was preser at at ved by inserting Article which bar the jurisdiction of the court in respect of disputes arising out of covenants and agreements and these Articles which are related to the covenants and agreements If the order cannot be challenged for the reasons given above the petitioner can have no right under the Wealth Tax Act because the right under the Wealth Tax Act is derived only from his recognition as a Ruler under Article There is no fundamental right to privy purse There is no fundamental right to <ORG> ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority the petitions are allowed and writs will issue declaring that the orders made by the President on September challenged here were illegal and on that account inoperative and the petitioners will be entitled to all their pre existing rights and privileges including right to privy purses as if the orders have not been made The petitioners will get their costs of the petitions
