Both these appeals are filed by the appellants being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated April passed by <ORG> in Civil Writ Petition Nos of and of The land mentioned in the said notification situated in village Kheri Nangal was sought to be acquired The appellant has stated that on June it made an application to the Director <ORG> Haryana for permission for change of user of land The land of the appellant situated in village Kheri Nangal was sought to be included in the notification Moreover urgency clause under Section of the Act was applied and a valuable right of raising objections under Section A of the Act was taken away in an arbitrary manner The right of the appellant to own possess and enjoy the property is not merely a Common Law right but also constitutional right under Article A of the Constitution which has a flavour of fundamental right The said order is challenged by the appellant in this Court The other appeal is filed by <ORG> society for short challenging the acquisition proceedings Thus there is nothing due and payable to <ORG> by the appellant We have already stated facts relating to the issuance of preliminary notification application of urgency clause under Section and issuance of final notification under Section of the Act while narrating the facts in the first case of <ORG> Respondents thereafter appeared affidavits and further affidavits were filed and the matters were ordered to be posted for final hearing We have heard learned counsel for the parties It was contended that the land was not needed for public purpose as set out in the notification of and hence the acquisition is not legal or lawful Again in when <ORG> applied for change of user of land the prayer was turned down inter alia on the ground that the land in question was proposed to be acquired for public purpose It was strongly urged by the learned counsel for the appellants that preliminary notification was issued on August and urgency clause was applied though there was no urgency at all The notification was published in the official gazette thereafter and in two daily newspapers on August and Even otherwise the action was bad and de hors the Act since the conditions laid down in sub section of Section of the Act have not been complied with inasmuch as there was neither grave urgency nor unforeseen emergency The Act is an expropriatory legislation which deprives a person of his property without his consent It was urged that the expression the date of publication has been defined in sub section of Section of the Act It was asserted that no notice as required by Section of the Act had been issued nor payment of percent of the compensation as required by sub section A of Section had been paid There was also total non application of mind on the part of the <ORG> Government in not considering the Government policy of granting exemption to functional units dealing with handloom and other industries On behalf of <ORG> the learned counsel adopted all the contentions raised on behalf of <ORG> It was urged that the land was required for public purpose viz It was submitted that there is no element of mala fide or colourable exercise of power which is clear form the fact that even in early eighties the land was sought to be acquired That however does not mean that the land was not needed for public purpose or that the public purpose disappeared or vanished The applicant was told at that time also that the land was required for public purpose Since the acquisition was for construction of road it was covered by Section of the Act and urgency clause was rightly invoked and in exercise of power under sub section of Section inquiry contemplated by Section A of the Act had been dispensed with All actions were consistent with the provisions of the Act and the appellants have no right to make complaint against those actions Before we deal with the matter on merits it would be appropriate if we notice the relevant provisions of the Act Purposes mentioned in Clauses i to viii are in the nature of public purpose and the land can be acquired for any such purpose Section enables the appropriate Government to issue preliminary notification for acquisition of land needed or likely to be needed for public purposes The said section is relevant and reads thus Section Publication of preliminary notification and powers of officers thereupon Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a company a notification to that effect shall be published in the Official Gazette and in two daily newspapers circulating in that locality of which at least one shall be in the regional language and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality the last of the dates of such publication and the giving of such public notice being hereinafter referred to as the date of publication of the notification Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer either generally or specially authorised by such Government in this behalf and for his servants and workmen to enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in such locality to dig or bore in the sub soil to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adapted for such purpose to set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work if any proposed to be made thereon to mark such levels boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting trenches and where otherwise the survey cannot be completed and the levels taken and the boundaries and line marked to cut down and clear away any part of any standing crop fence or jungle Provided that no person shall enter into any building or upon any enclosed court or garden attached to a dwelling house unless with the consent of the occupier thereof without previously giving such occupier at least seven days notice in writing of his intention to do so Section A is a salutary provision and enables any person interested in the land which is notified under sub section of Section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose to lodge objections against the proposed acquisition It is equally important provision and may be reproduced Section A Objections Hearing of objections Any person interested in any land which has been notified under section Sub section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a company may within thirty days from the date of the publication of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Every objection under sub section shall be made to the Collector in writing and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard in person or by any person authorised by him in this behalf or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry if any as he thinks necessary either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under section sub section or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendations on the objections together with the record of the proceedings held by him for the decision of that <ORG> Then comes Section which authorizes the appropriate <ORG> to issue final notification as to declaration that the land is required for public purpose Declaration that land is required for a public purpose Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act when <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report if any made under section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a company a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly authorised to certify its orders an different declarations may be made from time to time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the same notification under section sub section irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or have been made wherever required under section A sub section Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification under section sub section i published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment and Validation Ordinance but before the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the notification or ii published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the notification Provided further that no such declaration shall be made unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by a company or wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local authority In computing any of the periods referred to in the first proviso the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification issued under Section sub section is stayed by an order of a <ORG> shall be excluded Where the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> such compensation shall be deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues Every declaration shall be published in the Official Gazette and in two daily newspapers circulating in the locality in which the land is situate of which at least one shall be in the regional language and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such declaration to be given at convenient places in the said locality the last of the date of such publication and the giving of such public notice being hereinafter referred to as the date of publication of the declaration and such declaration shall state the district or other territorial division in which the land is situate the purpose for which it is needed its approximate area and where a plan shall have been made of the land the place where such plan may be inspected The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a Company as the case may be and after making such declaration <ORG> may acquire the land in manner hereinafter appearing In cases of urgency whenever the Appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any waste or arable land needed for a public purpose Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river side or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station or the appropriate Government considers it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation water supply drainage road communication or electricity the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty eight hours notice of his intention so to do or such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience In every case under either of the preceding sub sections the Collector shall at the time of taking possession offer to the persons interested compensation for the standing crops and trees if any on such land and for any other damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and not excepted in section and in case such offer is not accepted the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding compensation for the land under the provisions herein contained A Before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the Collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section The amount paid or deposited under sub section A shall be taken into account for determining the amount of compensation required to be tendered under section and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the compensation awarded by the Collector under section the excess may unless refunded within three months from the date of the Collector award be recovered as an arrear of land revenue In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does not so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section It is vehemently contended on behalf of the appellants that on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the respondents could not have invoked urgency clause by scuttling enquiry and dispensing with hearing of objections under Section A of the Act It was therefore submitted that when preliminary notification under Section was issued in there was no urgent need or compelling necessity nor it was a matter of urgency or emergency under Section of the Act which could justify the action and the proceedings are liable to be quashed We find considerable force in the above argument of the learned counsel for the appellants The scheme of the Act is clear which provides for issuance of preliminary notification under sub section of Section of the Act empowering the appropriate Government to issue such notification for acquisition of land needed or likely to be needed for any public purpose Since the property belongs to a private individual unless there is a public purpose as defined in clause of Section of the Act no acquisition of land can be made Whereas sub section of Section deals with cases of urgency sub section of the said section covers cases of sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency In <NAME> <NAME> of Uttar Pradesh Ors SCR the land was acquired by the <ORG> for public purpose viz The Court however noted that to that procedure there is an exception under Section which enables the <ORG> to apply urgency clause Where an action is taken under sub section of Section of the Act it is not necessary to follow procedure laid down in Section A and notification under Section can be issued without report from the Collector as envisaged by Section A The Court stated It will be seen that gives power to the <ORG> to direct the Collector though no award has been made under to take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purpose and such land thereupon vests absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances If action is taken under taking possession and vesting which are provided in after the award under are accelerated and can take place fifteen days after the publication of the notice under Then comes which provides that in case of any land to which the provisions of sub are applicable the Government may direct that the provisions of A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the notification under It will be seen that it is not necessary even where the Government makes a direction under that it should also make a direction under If the Government makes a direction only under the procedure under A would still have to be followed before a notification under is issued though after that procedure has been followed and a notification under is issued the Collector gets the power to take possession of the land after the notice under without waiting for the award and on such taking possession the land shall vest absolutely in Government free from all encumbrances It is only when the Government also makes a declaration under that it becomes unnecessary to take action under A and make a report thereunder It may be that generally where an order is made under an order under is also passed but in law it is not necessary that this should be so It will also be seen that under the Land Acquisition Act an order under or can only be passed with respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with respect to land which is not waste or arable and on which buildings stand From the above observations it is clear that even in cases falling under or covered by sub sections and of Section of the Act and the Government intends to acquire land in cases of urgency or unforeseen emergency it is still required to follow procedure under Section A of the Act before issuance of final notification under Section of the Act It is only when the Government also makes a declaration under sub section of Section that it becomes unnecessary to take recourse to procedure under Section A of the Act It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that in case of urgency it was open to the appropriate Government to dispense with inquiry under Section A by invoking sub section of Section of the Act It was also contended that the urgency contemplated by sub sections or of Section of the Act was by itself sufficient to invoke sub section of Section Therefore it is seen that if the appropriate Government decides that there is an urgency to invoke Section in the normal course Section notice will have to be published Section declaration will have to be made and after completing the procedure contemplated under Sections and notice will have to be given and on expiration of days from the date of such notice the authorities can take possession of the land even before passing of an award Therefore in cases where Government is satisfied that mere is an unforeseen emergency it will have to in the normal course issue a Section notification hold A inquiry make Section declaration and issue Section notice and possession can be taken immediately thereafter without waiting for the period of days prescribed under Section of the Act Section as noticed above provides that in cases where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there exists an urgency or unforeseen emergency as required under Sub sections or of Section it may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if such direction is given then A inquiry can be dispensed with and a declaration may be made under Section on publication of notification possession can be made The Court therefore proceeded to state A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a condition precedent for invoking Section that by itself is not sufficient to direct the dispensation of A inquiry It requires an opinion to be formed by the concerned government that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for dispensing with A inquiry which indicates that the <ORG> intended that the appropriate government to apply its mind before dispensing with A inquiry But then that is not language of the Section which in our opinion requires the appropriate <ORG> to further consider the need for dispensing with A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency This understanding of ours as to the requirement of an application of mind by the appropriate <ORG> while dispensing with A inquiry does not mean mat in and every case when there is an urgency contemplated under Section and unforeseen emergency contemplated under Section exists that by itself would not contain the need for dispensing with A inquiry It is possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate <ORG> under Section or the unforeseen emergency under Section itself may be of such degree that it could require the appropriate <ORG> on that very basis to dispense with the inquiry under Section A but then there is a need for application of mind by the appropriate <ORG> that such an urgency for dispensation of the A inquiry is inherent in the two types of urgencies contemplated under Section and of the Act In <NAME> the Court held that the question of urgency or unforeseen emergency is the mater which is entirely based on subjective satisfaction of the Government and the <ORG> do not interfere unless the reasons given are wholly irrelevant and there is non application of mind In <NAME> land was acquired for public purpose namely construction of houses for dalits Very often the officials due to apathy in implementation of the policy and programmes of the <ORG> themselves adopt dilatory tactics to create cause for the owner of the land to challenge the validity or legality of the exercise of the power to defeat the urgency existing on the date of taking decision under Section to dispense with Section A inquiry It is true that there was pre notification and post notification delay on the part of the officers to finalise and publish the notification So long as the problem is not solved and the need is not fulfilled the urgency continues to subsist Award will be made by the Collector notice has to be issued to the land owners or the person interested and thereafter possession can be taken Section no doubt deals with special situations and exceptional circumstances covering cases of urgency and unforeseen emergency In case of urgency falling under sub section of Section or of unforeseen emergency covered by sub section of Section special powers may be exercised by appropriate <ORG> but as held by a three Judge Bench decisions before more than four decades in <NAME> and reiterated by a three Judge Bench decision in <NAME> even in such cases inquiry and hearing of objections under Section A cannot ipso facto be dispensed with unless a notification under sub section of Section of the Act is issued The legislative scheme is amply clear which merely enables the appropriate <ORG> to issue such notification under sub section of Section of the Act dispensing with inquiry under Section A if the <ORG> intends to exercise the said power The use of the expression may in sub section of Section leaves no room of doubt that it is discretionary power of the <ORG> to direct that the provisions of Section A would not apply to such cases covered by sub section or of Section of the Act In our opinion therefore the contention of learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is covered by sub section or of Section of the Act sub section of Section would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry or hearing objections under Section A of the Act The actions of issuance of urgency clause under sub section of Section dispensing with inquiry under Section A and issuance of final notification under sub section of Section are required to be quashed and they are accordingly quashed The learned counsel for the appellant also contended that even if it is held that the respondent could have issued final notification without holding inquiry and hearing of objections under Section A of the Act the notification under Section of the Act is illegal and unlawful in view of the fact that the said notification has not been issued after the last of the dates of the publication and giving of public notice referred to as the date of publication of the notification under sub section of Section of the Act Urgency clause was applied and the case was covered by Section of the Act We would have entered into the said question had it been absolutely necessary for us to decide it in the case on hand But as observed hereinabove we are of the view that the appellants are entitled to succeed on the first ground that on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the appropriate Government was not justified in invoking urgency clause under sub section of Section of the Act by dispensing with inquiry and hearing of objections under Section A of the Act and the final notification issued under Section of the Act deserves to be set aside on that ground alone we express no opinion one way or the other on the interpretation of the expression the date of publication of the notification used in sub section of Section sub section of Section and Section of the Act Appeals are accordingly allowed with costs
