We have heard Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for non petitioners Nos and In exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Act <ORG> notified in the aforesaid notification that with immediate effect the rate of tax payable by a dealer in respect of goods specified in column of the list annexed thereto shall be as shown against them We may at once point out that this notification was issued under Section of the Act which deals with rate of tax So notification which has been relied upon by the <ORG> and on the basis of which the learned counsel for <ORG> has supported the order under revision to our mind is applicable for the purpose of the payment of tax on gowar as such and for that purpose as has been stated in the notification gowar in its all forms According to Sub section of Section tax is not payable under the Act on the sale or purchase of the goods specified in column of the Schedule on the fulfilment of the conditions mentioned therein After noticing the aforesaid authorities and also the ordinary the common parlance meaning or commercial meaning of gowar and gowar churi we came to the conclusion that gowar churi is not included in gowar as mentioned in entry of the Schedule We held that though there is no exemption of gowar but exemption from payment of tax would be available in view of entry to gowar churi as it is a cattle feed The question that calls for our determination is whether in view of the interpretation that we have given to entry of the Schedule qua the word gowar the notification that has been issued under Section of the Act and which has been relied on by the <ORG> will prevail for the purpose of interpreting the word gowar in connection with the question of exemption Section A by itself cannot override the power under Section On the other hand if certain goods have been classified for purposes of Section A and the point of tax has also been declared by <ORG> if such goods had been exempted from sale the department cannot contend that the exemption should not be construed in favour of the assessee In Commissioner of Sales Tax case STC ice cream and lassi were made taxable items by issuance of a notification while on the basis of the judicial opinion ice cream and lassi were included in the milk products which were exempted by other notifications It was held that even though ice cream and lassi have been made taxable by notification issued under Section A of the Act on account of the notification issued under Section of the Act exempting milk products which on judicial opinion include ice cream and lassi the turnover of ice cream and lassi cannot be included in the net taxable turnover It was observed as under It is thus settled that transactions or sales which enjoy exemption have to be included in the gross turnover but they are exempted when the net turnover is calculated and as for non liability to tax the turnover in respect of such transactions or sales is not included in the gross or the net turnover The notification issued under Section of the Act prescribing the rate of tax on gowar will not have overriding effect on entry of the Schedule appended to the Act which deals with exemption The notification on which reliance has been placed by the <ORG> will not nullify entry of the Schedule so far as the exclusion of gowar from cattle feeds is concerned We agree with the reasons given in the aforesaid three decisions of <ORG> and adopt them for resolving the question before us
