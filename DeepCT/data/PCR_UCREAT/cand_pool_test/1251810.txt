The petitioner claims that there is nothing in the booklet to bring it within the definition of objectionable matter as defined in Clauses i and of Section of the Press Act as alleged in the <ORG> order No In exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Press Objectionable Matter Act Act No of the Governor of Assam on the certificate of the Principal Law Officer of the State is pleased to declare all copies wherever found of the printed booklet in Assamese entitled Samaj Tan trabad Kiya Lagey written by <NAME> a I leader published by <NAME> <NAME> Gauhati and printed by <NAME> in <ORG> Gauhati and all other documents containing reprints copies translations of or extracts from the said booklet to be forfeited to <ORG> on the ground that the said booklet contains objectionable matters as denned in Clauses i and of Section of the said Act The order has been assailed before us mainly on these grounds That the order is incompetent and does not fulfil the essential requirements of Section of the Press Act Section of the Press Act which in vests Government with power to declare certain publications forfeited runs as follows <ORG> may on the certificate Of the Advocate General or the Principal Law Officer as the case may be of the <ORG> or of the Attorney General of India that any issue of a newspaper or news sheet or any book or other document wherever made contains any objectionable matter by notification in the official Gazette stating the grounds for the order declare that every copy of such issue of the newspaper or news sheet or of such book or document shall be forfeited to the Government Objectionable matter referred to in this section has been defined in Section of the Act We are in particular concerned with Clauses i and of the definition to which reference has been made in the order of the <ORG> It must be borne in mind that the proceedings under Sections and or and of the Act are very different from those under Section It must therefore be seen whether there are such safeguards if any and whether those safeguards are real and substantial or merely illusory unless the principal Law Officer or the Advocate General of the State as the case may be or the Attorney General of India certifies that the offending booklet or pamphlet contains objectionable matter and the other that under Section of the Act the person aggrieved by the order of Government can move <ORG> against that order within sixty days of the date of such order If these safeguards are real then it must be held that the restrictions imposed on the fundamental rights of speech and expression by virtue of Section are reasonable restrictions and the provision would be saved under Article of the Constitution I shall first take up the question whether in the present case <ORG> acted on the certificate of the Advocate General or the principal Law Officer as the case may be of the <ORG> or of the Attorney General of India Part and States are however differently administered and there is no specific provision for the appointment of an Advocate General in those States see Articles and In the second place the words as the case may be which qualify the disjunctive terms the Advocate General or the principal Law Officer of the State clearly show that they have reference only to those States where there is no Advocate General The certificate of the Advocate General is the very foundation of the jurisdiction conferred on the Governor or for the matter of that on the Government of the State to make the order of forfeiture under Section of the Act and there being no such foundation for the order it cannot stand Freedom of speech and expression evidently includes freedom of propagation of ideas The restriction therefore sought to be put by Section would come into conflict with the fundamental rights provided under Article a and unless the said provision is saved under Clause of the Article In other words it will have to be seen whether it imposes reasonable restriction on the exercise of the aforesaid rights and that the restriction is in the interest of public security The above principles are accepted but in view of the fact that we have already held that the order impugned before us does not fulfil even the requirements of Section of the Press Act and is therefore illegal and without jurisdiction it would be unnecessary for us to probe this matter any further Section says that any person aggrieved by an order of forfeiture passed by <ORG> under Section may within days of the publication of such order apply to <ORG> to set aside such order and upon such application <ORG> may pass any order that it thinks fit confirming varying or reversing the order of <ORG> Mere notification in the Official Gazette it is Urged would not be adequate notice in such cases and individual notices were essential to safeguard the remedy provided under Section of the Act These latter persons are vitally and mainly affected by the order of forfeiture or confiscation passed by the <ORG> under Section An obvious instance which I have in mind is where a particular edition of the offending booklet has been exhausted in the hands of the editor the printer and the publisher and has gone out into the open market The <ORG> having knowledge of the fact may refrain from taking any action on the foot of the forfeiture order against these persons until another edition of the booklet is ready for circulation which may be much beyond the period of days mentioned in Section In the mean time there is nothing to stop <ORG> from preventing the circulation of the booklet in the open market by forfeiture or otherwise As against other undefined persons therefore their address being unknown the <ORG> notification would be sufficient but as against the editor the printer and the publisher whose address must be known to the <ORG> there is some justification for the contention that they should have individual notices of the order ordered to be forfeited with a view to enable them to take action if so advised under Section of the Act within the period of limitation provided therein A notice of the declaration can be served upon the persons indicated above either by a registered cover or in the manner provided under Section of the Act for service of notice The above suggestion is indeed a matter for the <ORG> to take into consideration in order to make the provisions unexceptionable and to avoid any criticism on this score For the petitioner it has been argued that the booklet merely discusses the political philosophy and economic theory underlying socialism it shows that capitalism has no progressive role to play in solving the manifold problems that face the country and that the socialistic order alone can release all the productive forces of society Therefore we had to examine the entire translation of the booklet in order to find if there is anything objectionable contained in it as stated in the order of <ORG> So far as Clause of Section is concerned I should also at once observe that it has no application to the case at all It does suggest that all the evils of society and the country are due to capitalism and that it should be exterminated at once but the position is well settled that the words capitalism or capitalist do not denote any determinate section of people so as to attract the application of Clause of Section to such cases They state that Comments expressing disapprobation or criticism of any law or of any policy or administrative action of the <ORG> with a view to obtain its alteration or redress by lawful means and words pointing out with a view to their removal matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of enmity or hatred between different sections of the people of India shall not be deemed to be objectionable matter within the meaning of this section There is however nothing either directly or indirectly to indicate that this revolution must be brought about by violent means There is nothing in law to prevent a particular party in placing its philosophy and programme before the public so long as it does not directly or indirectly incite violence or subversion of the Government established by law There is nothing wrong in this expression of opinion Here again there is nothing objectionable in the passage Just quoted There is no other way of salvation but socialism in these horrible circumstances arising out of murders of children and women burning of villages attack on helpless passerby bribery oppression hooliganism black markets etc With reference to the context it appears to me that the passage is in criticism of the conduct of the Stalinist Communists who according to the author helped in the last imperialist war falsely calling it the Peoples War and then instead of preparing the people for attaining the socialist ideals were merely thinking of the elections which were then impending He poses the questions and answers thus When a real revolutionary says that the <ORG> apparatus should be shattered what does he mean to say He does not mean that all the buildings houses offices Courts and forts should be shattered nor that every one who is serving Government to day should be executed Again he follows it up with these remarks Whoever seek to transform capitalism gradually into socialism are too happy in the achievement of this <ORG> as if this <ORG> will render the work of transformation possible The pamphlet as I have said is a fairly long one containing about full size typed pages and I have picked out only some of the important passages on which Mr <NAME> relied in support of the order of Government I cam find nothing the booklet to lead us to hold that it is objectionable in the sense in which it is understood in law We have no hesitation in making the same observation in respect of this booklet and in holding that on a fair reading of it there is nothing to bring it within the definition of objectionable matter as held by <ORG> We have however looked into the notification aforesaid and we see no reason to alter our decision As a matter of fact there is nothing in the notification to indicate as to who is the Principal Law
