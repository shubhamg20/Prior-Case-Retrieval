By that time the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Code created by the Act of had come into force and the learned Subordinate Judge declined to make a complaint under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure as amended There was an appeal to the District Judge by the complainant The point upon which the learned Advocate who appeared for the petitioner relied was that the appeal to the learned Judge was out of time and the learned Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and to make the order When an offence in connection with the administration of civil justice comes to the notice of the District Judge it is open to him to lodge a complaint in <ORG> although a subordinate <ORG> may not have thought it necessary to take action The learned Judge then proceeded to say that the case was of such gravity that he would be failing in his duty if he did not institute a complaints deals with the procedure which is to be adopted in cases referred to in Section Sub section a Clause or Clause by a <ORG> with regard to offences which appear to have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding in that <ORG> and Section A confers certain powers upon a Superior <ORG> where the Subordinate <ORG> has omitted to take action The power conferred on Civil Revenue and Criminal Courts by Section Sub section may be exercised in respect of any offence referred to therein and alleged to have been committed in or in relation to any proceeding in any such Court by the Court to which such former Court is subordinate within the meaning of Section Sub section in any case in which such former Court has neither made a complaint under Section in respect of such offence nor rejected and application for the making of such complaint and where the <ORG> makes such complaint the provisions of Section shall apply accordingly In my judgment that section does not apply to this case because there was an application made to the learned Subordinate Judge and the learned Subordinate Judge rejected the application for the making of the complaint The next Section gives certain rights of appeal not only to the person against whom a complaint has been directed but also to the person whose application for a complaint has been rejected Any person on whose application <ORG> has refused to make a complaint under Section or Section A or against whom such a complaint has been made may appeal to the Court to which such former Court is subordinate within the meaning of Section Sub section and <ORG> may thereupon after notice to the parties concerned direct the withdrawal of the complaint or as the case may he itself make the complaint which <ORG> might have made under Section and if it makes such complaint the provisions of that section shall apply accordingly Therefore it appears to me that the scheme of the sections is that if <ORG> has neither made a complaint under Section nor rejected an application for the making of a complaint then <ORG> may take action and make a complaint This matter came before the learned District Judge by way of appeal and in view of the abovementioned sections the learned District Judge in my judgment should have considered whether the appeal was filed within the time specified The article in the Limitation Act which applies to this matter is Article and the material section of the Act is Section which provides that subject to the provisions contained in Sections to inclusive every suit instituted appeal preferred and application made after the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the first schedule shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence This Rule therefore must be made absolute and the order of the learned District Judge of the st January directing criminal proceedings to be instituted against <NAME> must be set aside
