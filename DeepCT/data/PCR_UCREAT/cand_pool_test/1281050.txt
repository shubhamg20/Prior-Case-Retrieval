the notice stated in Paragraph that sealed tenders in the prescribed form were invited from registered second class hoteliers having at least five years experience for putting up and running a second class restaurant and two snack bars at the Bombay Airport for a period of three years Paragraph stated that acceptance of the tender would rest with the Airport Director who does not bind himself to accept any tender and reserves to himself the right to reject all or any of the tenders received without assigning any reasons therefor Satisfied with the information given by the fourth respondents the first respondent accepted their tender on the terms and conditions set out in its letter The appellant filed a writ petition before <ORG> challenging the decision of the first respondent in accepting the tender of the fourth respondents In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the first respondent which is a public authority was bound to give effect to the most important condition of eligibility and acceptance of the tender by the first respondent was in violation of the standard or norm of eligibility set up by the first respondent and had the appellant known that non fulfilment of the condition of eligibility would be no bar for considering a tender he too would have competed for obtaining the contract The fourth respondents on the other hand contended that the requirement A that the tenderer must be a registered second grade hotlier was meaningless because the grading is given by <ORG> only to hotels or restaurants and not to persons running them and therefore there could be no second grade hotlier the notice setting out the conditions of eligibility having had no stautory force even if there was a departure from the standard or norm of eligibility it was not justiceable and the first respondent was competent to give the conract to anyone it thought fit and <ORG> reserved to itself the right to reject all or any of the tenders without assigning any reasons and therefore it was competent to it to reject all the tenders or negotiate with any person it considered fit to enter into a contract It is not possible to justify the action of the first respondent on the ground that it could have achieved the same result by rejecting all the tenders and entering into direct negotiations with the fourth respondents Although there was no statutory or administrative rule requiring the first respondent to give a contract only by inviting tenders and that on the terms of paragraph of the tender notice it was not bound to accept any tender the first respondent did not reject the tenders outright and enter into direct negotiation with the fourth respondents for awarding the contract Nor was the contract given to the fourth respondents as a result of direct negotiations The attainment of socio economic justice being a conscious end of <ORG> policy there is a vast and inevitable increase in the frequency with which ordinary citizens come into relationship of direct encounter with <ORG> power holders Whatever be the concept of the rule of law there is substantial agreement in juristic thought that the great purpose of the rule of law notion is the protection of the individual against arbitrary exercise of power wherever it is found It is unthinkable that in a democracy governed by the rule of law the executive <ORG> or any of its officers should possess arbitrary power over the interests of the individual And to the application of this principle it makes no difference whether the exercise of the power involves affectation of some right or denial of some privilege With the advent of the welfare state the civil service which traditionally carried out functions of <ORG> through natural persons was found inadequate to handle the new tasks of specialised and highly technical character The salient features of the Act are the Anthority which is a body cor porate having perpetual succession and a common seal consists of a Chairman and certain other Members who are appointed by the Central <ORG> The Central <ORG> has power to terminate the appointment or to remove a member from the Board of the <ORG> All non recurring expenditure Incurred by the Central <ORG> for or in connection with the purposes of the airports upto the appointed date and declared to be capital expenditure by the Central <ORG> shall be treated as capital provided by the Central <ORG> to the first respondent and all sums of money due to the Central <ORG> in relation to the airports immediately before the appointed date shall be deemed to be due to the first respondent The first respondent according to should pay the balance of its annual net profits to the Central <ORG> after making provision for reserve funds bad and doubtful debts depreciation in assets and so on The Central <ORG> has power to divest the first respodent temporarily from the management of any airport and direct ut to entrust such management to any other person Section gives power to the Central <ORG> to give directions in writing to the Airport <ORG> on questions of policy and the Airport <ORG> is bound by such directions Section empowers the Airport <ORG> to make regulations The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI This appeal by special leave raises interesting questions of law in the area of public law What are the constitutional obligations on the <ORG> when it takes action in exercise of its statutory or executive power Is the <ORG> entitled to deal with its property in and manner it likes or award a contract to any person it chooses without any constitutional limitations upon it What are the parameters of its statutory or executive power in the matter of awarding a contract or dealing with its propery The questions fell in the sphere of both administrative law and constitutional law and they assume special significance in a modern welfare <ORG> which is com mitted to egalitarian values and dedicated to the rule or law They can be determined only against the back ground of facts and hence we shall proceed to <ORG> the facts giving rise to the appeal <NAME> was present on behalf of himself <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> and there was one representative of <ORG> This letter showed that the th respondents had experience only of running canteens and not restaurants and it appeared that they did not satisfy the description of registered IInd Class Hotelier having at least years experience as set out in paragraph of the notice inviting tenders The th respondents stated that their sole proprietor <NAME> had started his career in catering line in the year at Hotel Janpath Delhi and gradually risen to his present position and that he had accordingly experience equivalent to that of a IInd Class or even st Class hotelier This information given by the th respondents appeared to satisfy the st respondent and by a letter dated th April the st respondent accepted the tender of the th respondents on the terms and conditions set out in that letter The th respondents accepted these terms and conditions by their letter dated rd April and deposited with the st respondent by was of security a sum of Rs Meanwhile one <NAME> who owned Cafe Excelsior filed Suit No of in <ORG> Bombay against the respondents challenging the decision of the <ORG> respondent to accept the tender of the th respondents and took out a notice of motion for restraining the st respondent from taking any further steps pursuant to the acceptance of the tender An appeal was preferred by <NAME> against this order but the appeal was dismissed by <ORG> on th october <NAME> preferred an appeal against the order granting the injunction but the appeal was rejected and ultimately a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court was also turned down on st July But it seems that the th respondents were not destined to be left in peace to run the two snack bars and soon after the dismissal of the appeal of <NAME> on th october and the failure of <NAME> to obtain an ad interim mandatory injunction in the suit filed by him against the st and the th respondents the appellant filed writ petition No of in <ORG> challenging the decision of the st respondent to accept the tender of the th respondents The appellant preferred an appeal to <ORG> of <ORG> against the order rejecting the writ petition and on notice being issued by <ORG> the st and the th respondents filed their respective affidavits in reply showing cause against the admission of the appeal The appellant thereupon filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and since it was felt that the questions raised in the appeal were of seminal importance this Court granted special leave and decided to hear the appeal at an early date after giving a further opportunity to the parties to file their respective affidavits That is how the appeal has now come before us for final hearing with full and adequate material placed before us on behalf of both the parties The main contention urged on behalf of the appellant was that in paragraph of the notice inviting tenders the st respondent had stipulated a condition of eligibility by providing that a person submitting a tender must be a registered IInd class Hotelier having at least years experience It was further contended in the alternative that paragraph of the notice clearly provided that the acceptance of the tender would rest with the Airport Director who did not bind himself to accept any tender and reserved to himself the right to reject all or any of the tenders without assigning any reasons therefor and it was therefore competent to the st respondent to reject all the tenders and to nogotiate with any person it considered fit to enter into a contract and this is in effect and substance what the st respondent did when he accepted the tender of the th respondents The second head of argument was that paragraph of the notice setting out the condition of eligibility had no statutory force nor was it issued under any administrative rules and therefore even if there was any departure from the standard or norm of eligibility set out in that paragraph it was not justiciable and did not furnish any cause of action to the appellant It was submitted that in any event the appellant had no right to complain that the st respondent had given the contract to the th respondents in breach of the condition of eligibility laid down in paragraph of the notice And lastly under the third head of argument it was submitted on behalf The appellant was also guilty of laches and delay in filing the writ petition and the High <ORG> was justified in rejecting the writ petition in limine particularly in view of the fact that during the period between the date of acceptance of the tender and the date of filing of the writ petition the th respondents had spent an aggregate sum of about Rs These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to discuss them in the order in which we have set them out It is clear from the affidavits and indeed there was no dispute about it that different grades are given by <ORG> to hotels and restaurants and therefore there may be a registered Ilnd Class Hotel but no such grades are given to persons running hotels and restaurants and hence it would be inappropriate to speak of a person as a registered llnd Class hoteIier Now here the expression used in paragraph of the notice was registered IInd Class hotelier and there can be no doubt that by using this expression the <ORG> respondent intended to delineate a certain category of persons who alone should be eligible to submit a tender It had a definite purpose in view when it laid down this condition of eligibility in paragraph of the notice This meaning is quite reasonable and does not do any violence to the language and makes sense of the provision contained in paragraph of the notice It was suggested on behalf of the st and the th respondents that there was nothing wrong in the st respondent giving the contract to the th respondents since it was competent to the st respondent to reject all the tenders received by it and to negotiate directly with The th respondents for giving them the contract and it made no difference that instead of following this procedure which perhaps might have resulted in the th respondents offering a smaller licence fee and the st respondent suffering a loss in the process true st respondent accepted The tender of the th respondents We do not think there is any force in this argument It is true that there was no statutory or administrative rule requiring the st respondent to give a contract only by inviting tenders and hence the st respondent was entitled to reject all the tenders and subject to the constitutional norm laid down in Art negotiate directly for entering into a contract Tenders were invited and out of the tenders received the one submitted by the th respondents was accepted and the contract was given to them That takes us to the next question whether the acceptance of the tender of the th respondents was invalid and liable to be set aside at the instance of the appellant It was contended on behalf GI the st and the th respondents that the appellant had no locus to maintain the writ petition since no tender was submitted by him and he was a mere stranger This rule was enunciat ed by Mr Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Seton where the learned Judge said An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged Accordingly if dismissal from employment is based on a define procedure even though generous beyond the requirement that bind such agency that procedure must be scrupulously observed He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the sword Even in England the recent trend in administrative law is in that direction as is evident from what is stated at pages in Prof There is no reason why we should hesitate to adopt this rule as a part of our continually expanding administrative law The attainment of socio economic justice being a conscious end of <ORG> policy there is a vast and inevitable increase in the frequency with which ordinary citizens come into relationship of direct encounter with <ORG> power holders Whatever be the concept of the rule of law whether it be the meaning given by <NAME> in his The Law of the Constitution or the definition given by <NAME> in his Road to Serfdom and Constitution of liberty or the exposition set forth by <NAME> in his The Rule of Law and the Welfare State there is as pointed out by <NAME> in his article on The Welfare State Rule of Law and Natural Justice in democracy Equality and Freedom substantial agreement is in justice thought that the great purpose of the rule of law notion is the protection of the individual against arbitrary exercise of power wherever it is found It is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed by the rule of law the executive Government or any of its officers should possess arbitrary power over the interests of the individual And to the application of this principle it makes no difference whether the exercise of the power involves affection of some right or denial of some privilege It was argued for the <ORG> that no person has a right to enter into contractual relationship with the <ORG> and the <ORG> like any other private individual has the absolute right to enter into contract with any one it pleases The learned Chief Justice said that when the <ORG> is trading with the public the democratic form of <ORG> demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions The activities of the <ORG> have a public element and therefore there should be fairness and equality The <ORG> need not enter into any contract with anyone but if it does so it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure It must therefore be taken to be the law that where the <ORG> is dealing with the public whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of largess the <ORG> cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and like a private individual deal with any person it pleases but its action must be in conformity with standard or norms which is not arbitrary irrational or irrelevant Where a <ORG> is wholly controlled by <ORG> not only in its policy making but also in carrying out the functions entrusted to it by the law establishing it or by the Charter of its incorporation there can be no doubt that it would be an instrumentality or agency of <ORG> But if extensive and unusual financial assistance is given and the purpose of the <ORG> in giving such assistance coincides with the purpose for which the corporation is expected to use the assistance and such purpose is if public character it may be a relevant circumstance supporting an extensive that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of <ORG> It will be seen that in this case there was considerable amount of <ORG> control of the library system in addition to extensive financial assistance and it is difficult to say whether in the absence of such control it would have been possible to say that the action of the trustees constituted <ORG> action But where financial assistance is not so extensive it may not by itself without anything more render the corporation an instrumentality or agency of government for there are many private institutions which are in receipt of financial assistance from the <ORG> and merely on that account they cannot be classified as <ORG> agencies The more an owner for his advantage opens up his property for use by the public in general the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it We have referred to some of these factors and they may be summarised as under whether there is any financial assistance given by the <ORG> and if so what is the magnitude of such assistance whether there is any other form of assistance given by the <ORG> and if so whether it is of the usual kind or it is extraordinary whether there is any control of the management and policies of the corporation by the <ORG> and what is the nature and extent of such control whether the corporation enjoys <ORG> conferred or <ORG> protected monopoly status and whether the functions carried out by the corporation are public functions closely related to governmental functions The order of black listing has the effect of depriving a person of equality of opportunity in the matter of public contract A person who is on the approved list is unable to enter into advantageous relations with the Government because of the order of blacklisting A citizen has a right to claim equal treatment to enter into a contract which may be proper necessary and essential to his lawful calling It is true that neither the petitioner nor the respondent has any right to enter into a contract but they are entitled to equal treatment with others who offer tender or quotations for the purchase of the It must therefore follow as a necessary corollary from the principle of equality enshrined in Article that though the <ORG> is entitled to refuse to enter into relationship with any one yet if it does so it cannot arbitrarily choose any person it likes for entering into such relationship and discriminate between persons similarly circumstanced but it must act in conformity with some standard or principle which meets the test of reasonableness and non discrimination and any departure from such standard or principle would be invalid unless it can be supported or justified on some rational and non discriminatory ground class of persons it effectively shut out all other persons carrying on trade in kendu leaves and also the new entrants into that business and hence it was ex facie discriminatory and imposed unreasonable restrictions upon the right of persons other than the existing contractors to carry on business The argument that existing contractors who had carried out their obligations in the previous year regularly and to the satisfaction of the <ORG> formed a valid basis of classification bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the sales namely effective execution of the monopoly in the public interest was also negatived and it was pointed out that exclusion of all persons interested in the trade who were not in the previous year licencees is ex facie arbitrary it had not direct relation to the object of preventing exploitation of pluckers and growers of kendu leaves nor had it any just or reasonable relation to the securing of the full benefit from the trade to the <ORG> The <ORG> rejected the contention of the <ORG> that by reason of section it was entitled to dispose of kendu leaves in such manner as it thought fit and there was no limitation upon its power to enter into contracts for sale of kendu leaves with such persons it liked The <ORG> held that the <ORG> was in the exercise of its power to enter into contracts for sale of kendu leaves subject to the constitutional limitation of Article and it could not act arbitrarily in selecting persons with whom to enter into contracts and discriminate against others similarly situate The petitioner challenged The decision of the <ORG> in a petition under Article of the Constitution on the ground inter alia that there had been discrimination against him vis a vis the rd respondent and as such there was contravention of Article of the Constitution The Constitution Bench rejected this contention of the petitioner and while doing so <NAME> made the following observation There is no discrimination because it is perfectly open to the <ORG> even as it is to a private party to choose a person to their liking to fulfil contracts which they wish to be performed Obviously what the <ORG> meant to say was that merely because one person is chosen in preference to another it does not follow that there is a violation of Article because the Government must necessarily be entitled to make a choice Thus there was no loss to <ORG> and merely because the <ORG> preferred one tender to another no complaint can be entertained On the contrary it postulates that the Government may reject a higher tender and accept a lower one only when there is valid reason lo do so as for example where it is satisfied that the person offering the Lower There must be some relevant reason for preferring one tenderer to another and if there is the <ORG> can certainly enter into contract with the former even though his tender may be lower but it cannot do so arbitrarily or for extraneous reason which was strongly relied upon on behalf of the respondents The auction was held pursuant to an order dated th January issued by the <ORG> of orissa in exercise of the power conferred under section of the Bihar orissa Excise Act and clause of this order provided that no sale shall be deemed to be final unless confirmed by the State <ORG> who shall be at liberty to accept or reject any bid without assigning any reason therefor One of the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners in that case was that the power retained by the <ORG> to accept or reject many bid without any reason therefor was an arbitrary power violative of Articles and It is expected to protect the financial interest of the <ORG> While accepting or rejecting a bid it is merely performing an executive function It will be seen from these observations that the validity of clause of the order dated th January was upheld by this Court on the ground that having regard to the object of holding the auction namely to raise revenue the Government was entitled to reject even the highest bid if it thought that the price offered was inadequate would include all constitutional and statutory authorities on whom powers are conferred by law <NAME> who delivered a separate judgment agreeing with the conclusion reached by the majority preferred to give a slightly different meaning to the expression other authorities He said that authorities constitutional or statutory would fall within the expression other authorities only if they are invested with the sovereign power of the <ORG> namely the power to make rules and regulations which have the force of law The ratio of this decision may thus be stated to be that a constitutional or statutory authority would be within the meaning of the expression other authorities if it has been invested with statutory power to issue binding directions to third parties the disobedience of which would entail penal consequence or it has the sovereign power to make rules and regulations having the force of law The only question was whether a writ of mandamus could lie and it was held that since there was no duty imposed on <ORG> by statute no writ of mandamus could issue against it The question which arose in this case was whether a reference of an industrial dispute between <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> and the <ORG> made by the State of Bihar under section of the Industrial Disputes Act was valid The <ORG> held that <ORG> was not a department of the <ORG> nor were its employees holding posts under the <ORG> within the meaning of Article Lastly we must refer to the decision in <NAME> <ORG> where the question was whether <ORG> was an authority within the meaning of Article The Court no doubt took the view on the basis of facts relevant to the constitution and functioning of the council that it was not an authority but we do not find any discussion in this case as to what are the features which must be present before a corporation can be regarded as an authority within the meaning of Article We may examine in the light of this discussion whether the st respondent namely <ORG> can be said to be an authority falling within the definition of State in Article It is necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the International Airport Authority Act hereinafter referred to as the Act for the purpose of determining this question Sub section of section of the Act provides that <ORG> shall constitute an authority to be called <ORG> to whom we shall hereafter refer as the st respondent Sub section states that the st respondent shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal and sub section enacts that the Ist respondent shall consist of a Chairman to be appointed by <ORG> the Director General of Civil Aviation exofficio and not less than six and not more than thirteen members to be appointed by <ORG> The term of office of every member of the st respondent is prescribed by sub section of section to be years but <ORG> is given under the <ORG> power to terminate the appointment of any member who is not a servant of the Government after giving him notice as also to terminate at any time the appointment of any member who is a servant of the Government Section sub section provides that as from the date appointed by <ORG> all properties and other assets vested in the Central Government for the purposes of the airport and administered by the Director General of Civil Aviation immediately before such date shall vest in the st respondent and all debts obligations and liabilities incurred all contracts entered into and all matters and things engaged to be done by with or for <ORG> immediately before such date shall be deemed to have been incurred entered into and engaged to be done by with or for the st respondent This sub section also says that all non recurring expenditure incurred by <ORG> for or in connection with the purposes of the airport upto the appointed date and declared to be capital expenditure by <ORG> shall be treated as the capital provided by <ORG> to the st respondent and all sums of money due to <ORG> in relation to the airport immediately before the appointed date shall be deemed to be due to the st respondent The functions of the st respondent are specified in section sub section provides that subject to the rules if any made by <ORG> in this behalf it shall be the function of the st respondent to manage the airports efficiently and sub section casts an obligation on the st respondent to provide at the airports such services and facilities as are necessary or desirable for the efficient operation of air transport services and certain specific functions to be performed by the st respondent are particularised in sub section Section requires the st respondent to submit for the approval of <ORG> a statement of the programme of its activities during the forthcoming financial year as well as its financial estimate in respect thereof at least three months before the commencement of each financial year and section provides that the accounts of the st respondent shall be audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accounts as certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General or any other person appointed by him in this behalf together with the audit report thereon shall be forwarded to <ORG> and <ORG> shall cause the same to be laid before both Houses of Parliament Section confers power on <ORG> to temporarily divest the st respondent from the management of any airport and to direct the st respondent to entrust such management to any other person Section gives power to <ORG> to give directions in writing from time to time on questions of policy and provides that the st respondent shall in the discharge of its functions and duties be bound by such directions Section confers rule making power on <ORG> for carrying out the purposes of the Act and power to make regulations is conferred on the st respondent under section lt will be seen from these provisions that there are certain features of the st respondent which are eloquent and throw considerable light on the true nature of the st respondent In the first place the chairman and members of the st respondent are all persons nominated by <ORG> and <ORG> has also the power to terminate their appointment as also to remove them in certain specified circumstances <ORG> is also vested with the power to take away the management of any airport from the st respondent and to entrust it to any other person or authority and for certain special reasons <ORG> can also supersede the Ist respondent <ORG> has also power to give directions in writing from time to time on questions of policy and these directions are declared binding on the st respondent The st respondent is also required to submit to <ORG> for its approval a statement of the programme of its activities as also the financial estimate and it must follow as a necessary corollary that the st respondent can carry out only such activities and incur only such expenditure as is approved by <ORG> Now on this view we should have ordinarily set aside the decision of the st respondent accepting the tender of the th respondents and the contract resulting from such acceptance but in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case we do not think it would be a sound exercise of discretion on our part to upset that decision and void the contract It does appear from the affidavits filed by the parties that the appellant has no real interest in the result of the litigation but has been put up by <NAME> for depriving the th respondents of the benefit of the contract secured by them The first salvo in the battle against the th respondents was fired by <NAME> proprietor of <ORG> who filed a suit challenging the decision of the st respondent to accept the tender of the th respondents but in this suit he failed to obtain an interim injunction and his appeal was dismissed by <ORG> on th October It was only after the failure to obtain interim relief in these two proceedings one by <NAME> and the other by <NAME> that the appellant filed the present writ petition in <ORG> of Bombay challenging the decision of the st respondent to accept the tender of the th respondents Now it appears from the record that the appellant was at the material time conducting a restaurant called <ORG> which was owned in partnership by three persons namely <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> It would therefore be a fair inference to make that the appellant was well connected with <NAME> and from the manner in which proceedings with a view to thwarting the attempt of the th respondents to obtain the benefit of their contract have been adopted one after the other in different names it does appear that the appellant has filed the writ petition at the instance of <NAME> with a view to helping him to obtain the contract for the restaurant and the snack bars We have grave doubts whether this writ petition was commenced by the appellant bona fide with a view to protecting his own interest Moreover the writ petition was filed by the appellant more than five months after the acceptance of the tender of the th respondents and during this period the th respondents incurred considerable expenditure aggregating to about Rs The position would have been different if the appellant had filed the writ petition immediately after the acceptance of the tender of the th respondents but the appellant allowed a period of over five months to elapse during which the th respondents altered their position We are therefore of the view that this is not a fit case in which we should interfere and grant relief to the appellant in the exercise of our discretion under Article read with Article of the Constitution We accordingly dismiss the appeal and confirm the order of <ORG> rejecting the writ petition
