This appeal impugns the judgment and order of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants It found that there was urgency in the public purpose for which the said land was acquired and that <ORG> the third respondent before us had the means to construct the market yard and godowns A Special Leave Petition filed before this Court by the appellants against the aforementioned judgment and order of <ORG> was dismissed on th April On th August the appellants filed the writ petition whereon the impugned judgment and order was made There was a clear order of the first respondent that in case the award was not declared within two years from the date of publication of the notification under Section the acquisition proceedings would lapse Section A had to be interpreted harmoniously with the other provisions of the said Act and could not apply where the proceedings for acquisition of the land had already come to an end by reason of the land having vested in the <ORG> He also submitted that the requirements of Section A namely the tender of per cent of the estimated compensation for the said land not having been complied with the taking of possession of the said land from the appellants was illegal and there was therefore no vesting thereof in the first respondent Upon considering the report of the Collector who hears such objections if the <ORG> is satisfied that the land is needed for the public purpose a declaration to that effect shall be made under the provisions of Section Section contemplates the issue of a notice that the <ORG> intends to take possession of the land and it must invite claims for compensation for all interests in the land Section states that the Collector may after he has made an award under Section take possession of the land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free form all encumbrances Section A was inserted in the said Act by Act of and it reads thus A It states that the Government shall be at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken Section provides from cases where there is urgency Special powers in cases of urgency In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in Section Sub section take possession of any land needed for public purpose a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in Section Sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of Section Sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section The amount paid or deposited under Sub section A shall be taken into account for determining the amount of compensation required to be tendered under Section and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the compensation awarded by the Collector under Section the excess may unless refunded within three months from the date of the Collector award be recovered as an arrear of land revenue In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of Sub section or Sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under Section Sub section There are two judgments of this Court which we must note it was held that <ORG> could not withdraw from acquisition under Section once it had taken possession of the land Any other view would enable the State <ORG> to circumvent the specific provision by relying upon a general power When possession of the land is taken under Section the land vests in the <ORG> There is no provision by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> reverts to the original owner by mere cancellation of the notification Ordinarily the <ORG> can take possession of the land proposed to be acquired only after an award of compensation in respect thereof has been made under Section When Section is applied by reason of urgency <ORG> takes possession of the land prior to the making of the award under Section and thereupon the owner is divested of the title to the land which is vested in the <ORG> Section states so in unmistakable terms Clearly Section A can have no application to cases of acquisition under Section because the lands have already vested in the <ORG> and there is no provision in the said Act by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> can revert to the owner Section A cannot be so construed as to leave the <ORG> holding title to the land without the obligation to determine compensation make an award and pay to the owner the difference between the amount of the award and the amount of per cent of the estimated compensation In the instant case even that per cent of the estimated compensation was not paid to the appellants although Section A required that it should have been paid before possession of the said land was taken but that does not mean that the possession was taken illegally or that the said land did not thereupon vest in the Ist respondent It is at any rate not open to the third respondent who as the letter of the Special Land Acquisition Officer dated th June shows failed to make the necessary monies available and who has been in occupation of the said land ever since its possession was taken to urge that the possession was taken illegally and that therefore the said land has not vested in the first respondent and the first respondent is under no obligation to make an award There is no merit whatsoever in the submission that compensation can be awarded to the appellants under Section The Rule is made absolute and the first and second respondents are directed by a writ of mandamus to make and publish an award in respect of the said land within twelve weeks from today The third respondent shall pay to the appellants the costs of the appeal quantified in the sum of Rs
