The suit was instituted by the plaintiff on the th June claiming a declaration of title to a annas gandas cowrie krant share of <NAME> bearing <NAME> No recorded in the name of the defendants as proprietors and confirmation of his possession He further claimed a declaration that he was entitled to get his name registered in the mutation department in respect of the disputed share and the removal of the names of the defendants and an injunction restraining them from proceeding with a partition suit before the Collector in respect to the share in dispute The decree holder <NAME> was originally the principal defendant in these suits but after the sale the auction purchaser <NAME> was made the principal defendant The plaintiff case with regard to this suit and the circumstances attending it is that it was in the first instance an attempt instigated by his father and uncle to endeavour to save their property from attachment by setting up <NAME> as a claimant to the annas gandas odd share which still remained recorded in his name that the auction purchaser <NAME> was under an obligation to the plaintiff father who was a hakim and in the habit of attending <NAME> in that capacity and that in order to discharge his obligation he consented to transfer the purchased property back to the plaintiff father but that instead of executing a kobala in favour of the plaintiff father for that purpose he confessed judgment in the suits brought both by <NAME> and the two sisters of the plaintiff father in respect of the shares claimed by them and with regard to the remaining shares he executed a kobala in favour of one <NAME> a friend of his as benamidar for the plaintiff father The evidence shows however that there was in fact no fraud perpetrated on any of the creditors of <NAME> as they were all paid off and subsequently <NAME> transferred his share by a ladavi deed to the plaintiff in and about the same time the shares of the two aunts of the plaintiff were also recorded in the name of the plaintiff wife With regard to the first point there was no direst documentary evidence showing a transfer of <NAME> share to <NAME> before and the only documentary evidence in support of this was a petition in whereby the plaintiff father applied for registration of his name in respect of the annas gandas odd share purchased from <NAME> in which he recites that this covered in addition to the annas gandas odd which she received from her husband the annas gandas transferred by <NAME> as well as the anna shara transferred to her by <NAME> As the whole share of the family was an annas share and as <NAME> admittedly acquired annas gandas odd from her husband and <NAME> there was no other source from which she could have acquired the other annas gandas odd making up the annas gandas except from <NAME> unless she acquired <NAME> share and there was no evidence to show that <NAME> ever parted with his interest The District Judge took a different view of the facts and came to the conclusion that the plaintiff had made out his title to the whole annas share including that Originally held by <NAME> and that the transaction which took place at the date of the suit brought by <NAME> in was a benami transaction in which <NAME> merely represented the plaintiff father It has been urged before us on behalf of the appellants that there is no real evidence to support these findings It is contended that the recitals in the petition of when the plaintiff father applied for registration of his name are not admissible in evidence against <NAME> and as no deed of transfer by <NAME> to <NAME> has been produced there is nothing from which it can be inferred that <NAME> ever did in fact part with his share These was undoubtedly evidence to support it to which the learned Judge refers The only real attack made by the appellants against this part of the judgment was first that it was net competent to the plaintiff to contend that <NAME> was acting as his benamidar as the plaintiff father admittedly lent himself to this transaction with a view to defeating his creditors and secondly that the decree in the suit brought by <NAME> against <NAME> and the plaintiff father and uncvle in was res judicata and binding on all parties to that suit including the plaintiffs predecessors in title In my opinion the principle relied upon by the appellants on this part of the case has no application to the present circumstances The decree was merely passed in favour of the plaintiff upon the confession of judgment by <NAME> the principal defendant
