Whether the Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment No The plaintiff filed IA No under Order XXXIX Rules and of the Code of Civil Procedure CPC for brevity for an interim injunction restraining the defendants their family members promoters officers agents etc The brief facts of the case are that the mark <ORG> was registered on vide registration no in class in the name of the predecessors in interest i <ORG> of the plaintiff with regard to hot plates toasters and water boilers Thereafter the mark JOHNSON which was by that time registered in Classes and vide registration nos and respectively and three pending applications being and for wider specification of goods in the afore mentioned respective classes were also assigned to <ORG> The defendants have contended that the suit filed by the plaintiff is bad in law and ought to be dismissed The Plaintiff is therefore guilty of concealing the said fact from this Court and has deliberately manipulated the cause of action to read as from the year although the defendant has been carrying on business since the year The suit of the plaintiff is barred by limitation and is not maintainable due to the plaintiff acquiescence delay and estoppel It is alleged by the defendants that there is no cause of action for the present suit and the plaint is liable to be dismissed as the plaintiff has no right title or interest in the subject matter of the trademark and the goods involved in the present case I have heard learned counsel for the parties After moving their respective submissions both the parties have informed the Court that up till the date of deed of assignment dated there is no dispute or challenge to the earlier assignments executed between the parties dated as well as the incorporation of <ORG> by the parties In the written statement there is a challenge made by the defendant No pertaining to the deed of assignment dated As per the defence raised by the said defendant the said deed of assignment is a forged document and the plaintiff on the basis of the same has procured the split trademark registration and orders from <ORG> There is no dispute that <ORG> made another application bearing No in Class for wider specification of goods covering items which are part and parcel of registered trademark No in addition to other goods It appears from the preceding paragraph wherein the description of goods is mentioned that both the trademark registered under Applications No and covered the item water boiler The case of the Defendant No is that the expression Electric storage type water heaters excluding instant type geysers that has been used in the assignment deed dated entered into between <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> is in fact a Hammam which is different from the product Electric water heaters excluding instant type geysers in which the Plaintiff has no right as the Plaintiff who has acquired the right from <ORG> <ORG> is using the same as water heater in the market on commercial scale From the documents filed by the parties it is clear that there is no distinction between the two expressions namely Electric storage type water heaters excluding instant type geysers and Electric water heaters excluding instant type geysers as is also evident from the TM application for amendment dated filed on behalf of <ORG> by <ORG> Trade Marks Agent representing Defendant No in the present case In view of the aforesaid reasons I am of the considered view that any subsequent action by the assignor or third party in relation to the items contrary to the assignment dated th March in the registered trade mark or pending applications or any entries made thereon was uncalled for and contrary to the law and orders dated and already passed The important aspect of the matter is that all the relevant parties who were involved in the various assignment deeds and agreements and filing the necessary application for making the amendment were represented by the same <ORG> attorney It appears from the documents filed by the parties that the assignor <ORG> after the assignment of items in favour of the plaintiff has made subsequent application in <ORG> claiming its rights for the same items owned by it and incorrectly got the order passed on It appears from the order letter dated issued by the <ORG> Office the item water boiler is still shown in the name of <ORG> under the trademark No in Class despite earlier orders already passed by according the assignment dated in favour of the Plaintiff There is a malafide intention on part of defendant No by filing a fresh application for the same items in <ORG> in the year after having knowledge that the goods in question had already been assigned in favour of the predecessor in interest of the Plaintiff One more opportunity was given to the parties to produce cogent evidence in order to show that they have been using the trademark JOHNSON in relation to water heater during the course of hearing since Prima facie there is no cogent evidence produced by the defendants to show the continuous use of the mark in relation to the goods in question Necessary entry in this regard has already been made in the register of Trademarks By following the decision of <ORG> in terms of paragraph of the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> Vs Union of India SCC wherein <ORG> has said that it is high time that actual compensatory costs be imposed with respect to legal proceedings as well as in light of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that costs have to follow It is made clear that any observation made herein shall be treated as tentative in nature and shall not constitute any expression of final opinion on the issues involved and shall have no bearing on the final merit of the case and submissions of the parties in the suit
