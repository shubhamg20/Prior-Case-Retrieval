The sole question for determination in this appeal is as to the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> to entertain the suit The appeal is taken from a judgment and order of <ORG> dated February which set aside a decree of the Subordinate Judge at Cuddalore dated March which had dismissed the respondents suit on the ground of want of jurisdiction and directed the Subordinate Judge to restore the suit to the file and to dispose of it on the merits As they anticipated an increase in the ad valorem duty to come into effect at the beginning of they requested a telegraphic reply which they received on December saying If you desire import before January first you must import goods and deposit duty calculated on higher tariff value Inspector will at time of taking deposit and passing goods take sealed samples for test and will also deliver to you other sealed samples to enable you to appeal if necessary Various issues were framed by the Subordinate Judge but it was decided to determine in the first instance Issue No Has this Court no jurisdiction to entertain this suit and is the suit barred by the provisions of the Sea Customs Act By a judgment delivered on March the Subordinate Judge held that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and dismissed the suit The Section of the Sea Customs Act which are material are contained in Chapter XVII of the Act which is headed Procedure relating to Offences Appeals and which includes Section to Such authority or officer may thereupon make such further enquiry and pass such order as he thinks fit confirming altering or annulling the decision or order appeal ed against Provided that no such order in appeal shall have the effect of subjecting any person to any greater confiscation penalty or rate of duty than has been adjudged against him in the original decision or order Every order passed in appeal under this Section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by Section be final <ORG> may on the application of any person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under this Act by any officer of <ORG> or Chief <ORG> Authority and from which no appeal lies reverse or modify such decision or order There can be little doubt that adjudications as to confiscations increased rates of duty or penalties made under the power conferred by Section are decisions or orders within the meaning of Section and the appellant submitted in the first place that the decision of the Assistant Collector in the present case was an adjudication as to increased rate of duty under Section Their Lordships agree with <ORG> that there is no reason for limiting the words any decision or order passed The Sea Customs Act was passed to consolidate and amend the law relating to the levy of Sea Customs duties which was then regulated by the Consolidated Customs Act Act VI of which was repealed by the Act of If there were any doubt as to the proper construction of Section of the Act it would undoubtedly be legitimate to consider the previous law which it was consolidating and amending and their Lordships desire to add that their view already expressed as to the construction of Section is confirmed by a consideration of the provisions of the Act of If any dispute shall arise as to the proper rate of Duty payable in respect of any goods imported into or exported from any Port in British India the importer exporter owner or consignee of such goods or his agent shall deposit in the handa of the Officer in charge of <ORG> at the Port of importation or exportation respectively the amount of Duty demanded by such Officer pending the decision of the Chief Customs authority It shall thereupon be lawful for such authority or superior Officer to make such further enquiry and to pass such order as he shall think proper confirming altering or annulling the original award Provided that no such order in appeal shall have the effect of subjecting any person to any greater confiscation penalty or rates of Duty than shall have been adjudged against him in the original award In their Lordships opinion it is clear that the provisions of Section and of Section are both now incorporated in Section of the later Act the subject matter of the appeal being altered from an award to a decision or order and the heading of the chapter being altered to Procedure relating to Offences Appeals etc It is now necessary to determine whether the order of the Collector of <ORG> dated June which dismissed the appeal under Section and which was confirmed by the Governor General in <ORG> on an application under Section excludes the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> to entertain a challenge of the merits of that decision It is also well settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded the civil <ORG> have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure Many of the cases referred to in the judgments below are of this nature and are not relevant to the present case in which there are no allegations of that nature Section provides that every order passed in appeal under this Section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by Section be final By Section and a precise and self contained code of appeal is provided in regard to obligations which are created by the statute itself and it enables the appeal to be carried to the supreme head of the executive government In their judgment <ORG> refer with approval to the unreported decision of <ORG> Trotter in No of in which he held that the suit which challenged the adjudication of a fine under Section was barred by Section and the learned Judges add We think that the decision in that case is if we may say so not open to exception and it does not help the <ORG> in this case because the Act of the <ORG> Authorities in that case was an adjudication The main principles to be observed in the present case are to be found in the well known judgment of <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> which was approved of in <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> A The question is whether the present case falls under the third class stated by <NAME> viz where the statute creates a liability not existing atcommon law and gives also a particular remedy for enforcing it Withrespect to that class it has always been held that the party must adopt the form of remedy given by the statute no appeal had been taken under Section the question of jurisdiction was not in issue though in the former case an issue had been framed but it was abandoned by the Advocate General in their Lordships opinion neither Section nor the principleinvolved in the decision in <NAME> case affect the validity of an Act of the Indian Legislature which creates an obligation and provides an exclusive code for its determination such an obligation is not covered by Sub section of Section The appellant will have the costs of the appeal and also his costs in <ORG>
