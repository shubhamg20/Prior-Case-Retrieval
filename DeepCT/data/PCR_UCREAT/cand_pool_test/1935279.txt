HEADNOTE The first appellant was convicted under IPC for shooting and injuring PW at the instigation of the second appellant who was himself convicted of an offence under read with In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that they did not have a fair trial the <ORG> as well as the trial court on an erroneous view of the law refused to take their defence into consideration they ignored important circumstances appearing in favour of the appellants and furthermore some of the conclusions reached by them were unsupported by any evidence on record It was also contended that an inadmissible document namely a statement made by the second appellant in the course of the investigation was wrongly admitted this admission was hit by a of the Code of Criminal Procedure which bad also greatly prejudiced the case of the appellants HELD The appeals must be allowed and the appellants acquitted In other words the plea taken by the appellants in this case was never before litigated between them and the <ORG> the Opposite party in the present case The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In these connected appeals by special leave the legality of the convictions of the appellants appellant <NAME> under of the Indian Penal Code and appellant <NAME> under of the Indian Penal Code is challenged In order to appreciate the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellants it is necessary to state briefly the prosecution as well as the defence version The case made out by the prosecution is that because of previous enmity <NAME> shot and injured <NAME> at the instigation of <NAME> on the evening of October in Natwar Bazar It was urged on behalf of the appellants that they did not have a fair trial <ORG> as well as the trial court on an erroneous view of the law refused to take into consideration their defence they ignored important circumstances appearing in their favour and further some of the conclusions reached by them are unsupported by any evidence on record The prosecution case was that immediately after the occur rence <NAME> was chased and caught and at that time he had in his hands the revolver Ex The prosecution proceeded on the basis there is no ambiguity about it that Ex the trial court and <ORG> ignored the probabilities and lost sight of the evidence afforded by the circumstances appearing in the case Under these circumstances we are unable to agree with <ORG> that the prosecution had no duty to offer any explanation as regards those injuries In our judgment the failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation in that regard shows that evidence of the prosecution witnesses relating to the incident is not true or at any rate not wholly true Further those injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants Both the trial court as well as <ORG> refused to take into consideration the plea of the appellants on the ground that that plea did not commend itself to the trial Magistrate in the case instituted on the complaint of <NAME> They were erroneously of the view that the plea in question was barred by the rule laid down by this <ORG> in <NAME> case <NAME> of <ORG> in the King Wilkes explained the legal position in these words Whilst there is not a great deal of authority upon the subject it appears to me that there is nothing wrong in the view that there is an issue estoppel if it appears by record of itself or as explained by proper evidence that the same point was determined in favour of a prisoner in a previous criminal trial which is brought in issue on a second criminal trial of the same prisoner But if such a condition of affairs arises I see no reason why the ordinary rules of issue estoppel should not apply But the law laid down in those cases has no application to the facts of the present case In other words the plea taken by the appellants in this case was never before litigated between them and the <ORG> the opposite party in the present case In that event he is entitled to the benefit of doubt The question has sometimes been mooted as to whether the same principle of issue estoppel could be raised against an accused the argument against its application being that the prosecution cannot succeed unless it proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> trying the accused by evidence led before it that he is guilty of the offence charged In the alternative he contended that that document could not have been used to discredit the plea taken by <NAME> We have earlier noted the two divergent versions given by <NAME> and <NAME> in respect of the incident that took place on the evening of October It was contended on behalf of the appellants that whether that statement is held to have been taken during the investigation of the complaint made by or during the investigation of the complaint made by <NAME> in either case it is hit by of the Code of Criminal Procedure It was also urged that the rule laid down in <NAME> case has no application to the facts of the present case In the instant case no portion of Ex Hence the rule laid down in <NAME> case could not have been called into aid We accordingly allow these appeals and acquit the appellants
