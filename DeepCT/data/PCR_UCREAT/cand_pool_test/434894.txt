The prosecution primarily depended upon the evidence of <NAME> the Secretary cum Accountant of <ORG> and it was contended on behalf of the appellants that he was an accomplice The <ORG> judge convicted all the appellants under read with of the Indian Penal Code and further convicted <NAME> and <NAME> for substantive offences under <NAME> under A read with and <NAME> under A of the Indian Penal Code Held that <ORG> had jurisdiction to try <NAME> for the offence under of the Indian Penal Code committed beyond its jurisdiction in pursuance of the alleged conspiracy with which he and the other co accused were charged There was identity of method in all the transactions and they must be held to originate from the one and same conspiracy Since the confession made by <NAME> had not been shown to have been made under any threat or inducement or promise from a person in authority it could not be anything but voluntary even though it might have been made for the purpose of screening the scheme of the conspiracy and <ORG> was in error in holding that it was otherwise of the Constitution since it was not made by him at a time when he was accused of an offence <NAME> was also convicted under A read with I <NAME> was convicted under A I To appreciate the case against the appellants we may first state generally the facts leading to the case On the same day <ORG> and <ORG> made an application for the opening of the account at Bombay with the result that Current Account No was opened <ORG> and <NAME> state that <ORG> had authorised <NAME> in general to purchase and sell securities and that it was in pursuance of such authorisation that <NAME> on his own purchased and sold securities without any further reference to <ORG> or further instructions from <ORG> The transactions which have given rise to the present proceedings against the appellants consisted of purchase of securities for this company and sale of the securities which the company held <ORG> however denies that <NAME> ever approached him for the confirmation or approval of the purchase transaction and that he told him that the purchase transaction was entered into under his instructions He had no knowledge of the actual modus operandi of <NAME> which led to the diversion of the funds of the company to <ORG> According to him he was under the impression that what he did amounted to giving of a loan by <ORG> to <ORG> and that there was nothing wrong in it He asserts emphatically that if he bid known that he was doing was wrongful he would have never done it and would have utilised other means to raise the money to meet the losses of <ORG> as he had large credit in the business circle at Bombay and as <ORG> possessed shares which would be sold to meet the losses In order to appreciate the points of law raised by Mr <NAME> we may now state the charges which were framed against the various appellants Mr <NAME> has raised the following contentions <ORG> had no territorial jurisdiction to try offences of criminal breach of trust committed by <NAME> at Bombay <NAME> was not an agent within the meaning of I as only that person could be such agent who professionally carried on the business of agency We have heared the learned counsel for the parties on facts even though there are concurrent findings of fact as Mr <NAME> has referred us to a large number of inaccuracies most of them not of much importance in the narration of facts in the judgment of <ORG> and has also complained of the omission from discussion of certain matters which were admittedly urged before <ORG> and also of misapprehension of certain arguments presented by him We need not however specifically consider points No to as questions urged in that form against <NAME> mentioned that he committed criminal breach of trust in pursuance of the said conspiracy <NAME> submitted that this decision required reconsideration and we heard him and the learned Solicitor General on the point and having considered their submissions came to the conclusion that no case for reconsideration was made out and accordingly expressed our view during the hearing of these appeals We need not therefore discuss the first contention of Mr <NAME> and following the decision in <NAME> case hold that <ORG> had jurisdiction to try <NAME> of the offence under I as the offence was alleged to have been committed in pursuance of the criminal conspiracy with which he and the other co accused were charged We do not agree with this contention It reads Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that propertly or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied which be has made touching the discharge of such trust or wilfully suffers any other person so to do commits criminal breach of trust The section reads Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property in his capacity of a public servant or in the way of his business as a banker merchant factor broker attorney or agent commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may ex tended to ten years and shall also be liable to fine Reliance is also placed for the suggested restricted meaning of property in I on the cases Reg We are of opinion that there is no good reason to restrict the meaning of the word property to movable property only when it is used without any qualification in or in other sections of the Indian Penal Code Whether the offence defined in a particular section of the Indian Penal Code can be committed in respect of any particular kind of property will depend not on the interpretation of the word property but on the fact whether that particular kind of property can be subject to the acts covered by that section Section I defines movable property No reasons are given in the judgment If the <ORG> had intended to restrict the operation of to movable property only there war no reason why the general word was used without the qualifying word movable We therefore do not see any reason to I restrict the word property to movable property only A different view has been expressed with respect to the content of the word property in certain sections of the Indian Penal Code including The case law therefore is more in favour of the wider meaning being given to the word property in sections where the word is not qualified by any other expression like movable When used in connection with the word fund in its second meaning they connote that for the purposes of the account in which the fund finds a place the payment is debited to that fund an operation which of course has no relation to the actual method of payment or the particular cash resources out of which the payment is made The expression funds in the charge is used in the first sense meaning thereby that <NAME> and <NAME> had dominion over the amount credited to <ORG> in the account of the Bank inasmuch as they could draw cheques on that account As Chairman and Principal Officer of <ORG> he had the power on behalf of the company to operate on those accounts Article of the Articles of Association of the Bharat Insurance Company provides that the business of the company shall be managed by the Directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not under any particular law or regulation not to be exercised by them He states that he was present at that meeting and had put up these draft bye laws before <ORG> and that the Directors while passing these bye laws issued a directive that they should come into force on January and that accordingly be added in ink in the opening words of the bye laws that they would be effective from January There is no reason why <NAME> should depose falsely There is no evidence that the bye laws approved by <ORG> were actually signed by the Chairman <NAME> He must have got his own copy of the revised bye laws put up before the meeting and it is expected that he would make necessary corrections in his copy in accordance with the form of the bye laws as finally approved at the meeting There was no reason to sign every page of the copy if it was merely a draft office copy that was with him It appears from his statement in cross examination that the words received th September meant that copy of the byelaws was received by the <ORG> on that date <NAME> proves the letter Exhibit to be a copy of the letter sent along with these bye laws to the <ORG> and states that both the original and were signed by <NAME> are the bye laws of <ORG> which came into operation on I supplied copy of Ex He also signed the covering letter which was sent to <ORG> along with the copy of the bye laws Ex I produce the carbon copy of the letter dated which was sent as a covering letter with the bye laws of <ORG> to <ORG> New Delhi The certified copy of the byelaws of <ORG> which was sent for registration to the <ORG> along with the original letter of which Ex By the same resolution the words Managing Director in Article of the Bye laws stating the powers of the Chairman were substituted by the words General Manager In support of this contention reliance is placed on the case reported as <NAME> King Emperor We do not agree with the contention Technically speaking there was no entrustment to the petitioner personally This case clearly did not deal directly with the question whether a person who jointly with another has dominion over certain property can commit criminal breach of trust with respect to that property or not The effect of <NAME> delivering the blank cheques signed by him to <NAME> may amount to putting <NAME> in sole control over the funds of <ORG> and there would Dot remain any question of <NAME> having joint dominion over those funds and this contention therefore will not be available to him It was also urged for <NAME> that he bad obtained control over the funds of <ORG> by cheating <NAME> inasmuch as he got blank cheques signed by the latter on the representation that they would be used for the legitimate purpose of the company but latter used them for purposes not connected with the company and that therefore he could not commit the offence of criminal breach of trust It was contended on his behalf To justify the committal under the Extradition Act it was incumbent on the prosecutors to offer prima facie evidence that the money and securities which the prisoner was charged with having misappropriated were intrusted to him in the capacity of agent that is a person who carries on the business or occupation of an agent and intrusted with them in that capacity and without any authority to sell pledge or negotiate and not one who upon one solitary occasion acts in a fiduciary character It was held in view of the section referring to banker merchant broker attorney or other agent that a was limited to a class and did not apply to everyone who might happen to be intrusted as prescribed by the section but only to the class of persons therein mentioned It was further said In our judgment the other agent mentioned in this section means one whose business or profession it is to receive money securities or chattels for safe custody or other special purpose and that the term does not include a person who carries on no such business or profession or the like This case therefore is authority to this effect only that the term agent in that section does not include a person who just acts as in agent for another for a particular purpose with respect to some property that is entrusted to him i does not include a person who becomes an agent as a consequence of what he has been charged to do and who has been asked to do a certain thing with respect the property entrusted to him but includes such person who before such entrustment and before being asked to do something already carried on snob business or profession or the like as necessitates in the course of such business etc That is to say he is already an agent for the purpose of doing such acts and is subsequently entrusted with property with direction to deal with it in a certain manner It was contended before <ORG> that the offence under was limited to the case of one who carried on an agency business and did not comprehend a person who was casually entrusted with money either on one individual A It follows that a certain entrustment provided it be in the course of business as a mercantile agent would make the person entrusted with a factor i would make him belong to the class of factors These cases are authority for the view that the word agent would include a person who belongs to the class of agents i who carries on the business of an agent To appreciate these reasons we may mention here the facts of that case The accused there is said to have denied all knowledge of the jewels which had been given to him by the complainant for pledging and had been pledged and redeemed It was said that it was not a case under a I The reason given was There is no allegation that the jewels were entrusted to the accused in the way of his business as an agent The reasons emphasize both those aspects we have referred to in considering the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> Case and we need not say anything more about it What I requires is that the person alleged to have committed criminal breach of trust with respect to any property be entrusted with that property or with dominion over that property in the way of his business as an agent The agent acts mostly as a representative of the principal and has more powers in dealing with the property of the principal and consequently there are greater chances of his misappropriating the property if he be so minded and less chances of his detection He admits this in his statement under Cr In view of our opinion with respect to <NAME> and <NAME> being agents within the meaning of I and being entrusted with dominion over the funds of <ORG> in the Banks which comes within the meaning of the words property in these appellant would commit the offence of criminal breach of trust under in case they have dealt with this property in any manner mentioned in I We may now proceed to discuss the detailed nature of the transactions said to have taken place in pursuance of the alleged conspiracy Of course there is no evidence about the conversation which took place at these talks He gave himself out as the sole proprietor and mentioned the business of the company in the form for opening account as merchants and commission agents There is no dispute now that <ORG> did not carry on any business either as merchants and commission agents or as merchants and piece goods dealers <NAME> states that he did this business as <ORG> needed money at that time He thought that <ORG> would make profit after some time and thereafter pay it back to <ORG> for purchasing securities and therefore he postponed the dates of delivery of the securities to <ORG> The total cost of those securities worked out at Rs The cost worked out to Rs No mentioned was made in the letter about the payment being made to <ORG> through cheques or about the arrangement about getting the securities from <ORG> or about the postponement of the delivery of the securities by that company There was therefore necessity to deposit funds in the <ORG> before they could be drawn ostensibly to pay the price of securities to be purchased Again the accounts of <ORG> or of <ORG> at <ORG> did not have sufficient balance to meet the losses and consequently sale of certain securities held by <ORG> and purchase of other securities again took place No telephonic communication appears to have taken place between Delhi and Bombay on receipt of the demand from the brokers on September for the payment of the losses presumably because necessary steps to be taken both in connection with the fictitious purchase of securities in order to pay money to <ORG> for being made over to the Union Agencies when funds were needed and also or providing funds in the Insurance Company account with <ORG> Bombay in case the balance was not sufficient to meet the losses had already been adopted in the previous transactions presumably after consultations between <ORG> and <NAME> This lends weight to the significance of the telephonic communications between Delhi and Bombay in the critical period of August and early September There are two cases however in which a person has been held to be an accomplice even if he is not a particeps criminis Accomplices in previous similar offences committed by the accused on trial are deemed to be accomplices in the offence for which the accused is on trial when evidence of the accused having committed crimes of identical type on other occasions be admissible to prove the system and intent of the accused in committing the offence charged <NAME> Director of Public Prosecution The counterfoils have not been produced and there is no evidence that they showed the real state of affairs i that the cheques were issued to <ORG> and not to the brokers from whom the securities were purchased Moreover counterfoils reach the head office after a long time and there is no particular reason why <NAME> should notice the counterfoils then Even if it be considered that <NAME> evidence required corroboration as to the part played by <NAME> the circumstances to which we would refer later in this judgment afforded enough corroboration in that respect He made certain statements in <ORG> which were at variance with the statement made on that occasion He has contended that in view of of the Indian Evidence Act any previous statement of a witness inconsistent with his statement in <ORG> if otherwise proved could be used to impeach his credit and that therefore the <ORG>s below were not right in ignoring the inconsistencies in the statement of <NAME> merely on the ground that they were not put to him in cross examination about <NAME> being authorised by a <ORG> resolution to deal with the securities is not considered by <NAME> to be a false statement as he himself stated in answer to question No that such a statement could possibly be made by <NAME> in view of <ORG> considering at the meeting the question whether <NAME> be authorised to purchase and sell securities on behalf of the company in order to make profits It is urged by Mr <NAME> that it was somewhat unusual to put off the entries with respect to advises received by a day that the entries must have been made on the day the advices were received and that in this manner the entries made by these clerks contradict <NAME> A witness cannot be contradicted by first supposing that a certain thing must have taken place in a manner not deposed to by any witness and then to find that was not consistent with the statement made by that witness We see no point in this objection The proceedings of the meeting of <ORG> with respect to the confirmation of the purchase and sale of securities do not mention that action was taken on the basis of the office notes This does not matter as we have referred to this office note in connection with <NAME> statement that office notes used to be prepared after <ORG> statement that the particular purchase of shares was under his instructions <NAME> was cross examined with respect to certain letters he had sent to <NAME> He stated in his deposition on July that <ORG> accepted his suggestion for writing to <NAME> to send him the distinctive numbers of the securities which had been purchased but not received at the head office and that when he reported non compliance of <NAME> in communicating the distinctive numbers and suggested to <ORG> to ring up <NAME> to send the securities to the head office <ORG> agreed <NAME> also stated that in September or October there was a talk between <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> about the low yield of interest on the investments of <ORG> and it was suggested that the money be invested in securities shares and debentures <NAME> stated that <NAME> had told him that <NAME> would give the explanation of the securities not produced before the auditors There is no reason to prefer <NAME> statement to that of <NAME> Questions put to the Administrator Mr <NAME> in cross examination implied that <NAME> was a reliable person and efforts to win him over failed <NAME> could not give any satisfactory explanation as to why he remained silent with regard to his claim for conveyance allowance for a period of over two years but denied that he was given the allowance with retrospective effect in order to win him over to the prosecution At this he told <ORG> that if the sale and purchase of securities was to be carried on as hithertofore there was no use depositing them in the <ORG> and thus pay frequent heavy withdrawal charges and suggested that the securities could be deposited in the <ORG> if the sale and purchase of them had to be stopped altogether and that <ORG> then said that the securities should be sent for to Delhi in the middle of December for inspection by the auditors He denied the suggestion that he made this change in his statement under pressure of the <ORG> He however denied that he had been dictated notes by the police in order to answer questions in cross examination or that be remained with the police till or that the Secretary to the Administrator held out a threat about the forfeiture of his gratuity in case be did not make a statement favourable to the prosecution We see no Reason for the police to bring pressure on <NAME> to introduce falsely the conversation in August He had no reason to use this expression if he was sending them on his own it cannot be presumed that in such transactions there could be such delay as would make statement in these letters not corroborative evidence under of the Evidence Act which provides that previous statements made at or about the time a fact took place can be used for corroborating the statement in <ORG> He attempted to show that <ORG> did not know about <ORG> and also to show that <NAME> had reasons to know about it and was therefore in the position of an Accomplice a stand which is also taken by <ORG> We may now deal first with the case of <NAME> appellant He contends that he had no dishonest intentions and therefore did not commit any of the offences he had been charged with and convicted of Learned counsel for <ORG> has urged two points in addition to some of the points of law urged by learned counsel for <ORG> He urged that the transactions entered into by <ORG> were ordinary genuine commercial transactions and that there was no evidence of <ORG> acting dishonestly in entering into those transactions We have already expressed the opinion that the transaction in connection with the investment of the funds of <ORG> were not bonafide purchase and sale transactions One is said to act dishonestly when he does any thing with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another He had nothing to fear when he was acting honestly and according to him when he was doing nothing wrong The fact that the Administrator did not cancel any contract entered into on behalf of <ORG> under the powers given to him by of the Insurance Act does not mean that every such contract was in the interest of <ORG> Of the points of law urged for <NAME> we have already dealt with those relating to the jurisdiction of <ORG> to try the various offences to the content of the words property dominion and agency in I The only other points raised are that the offence under A could not be said to be committed in pursuance of the conspiracy and that it was not a case of one conspiracy but of several conspiracies is based on the letters written by <NAME> from Bombay to Delhi intimating his entering into the contracts of purchase of securities and indicating that cheques had been issued in payment to the brokers There is no evidence that the brokers appointed <ORG> as their agent for the purpose which makes certain conduct of a clerk officer or servant an offence <NAME> was a servant of <ORG> as he was its Agent and received payment for doing work as an agent We do not agree with the contention that it was a case of several conspiracies each transaction to meet the losses as they occurred giving rise to an independent conspiracy There is sufficient material on record to establish his knowledge and part in the conspiracy He started in answer to question No I started business in the name of <ORG> in or beginning of and in answer to question No he stated that he had no knowledge about <NAME> entering into contracts on behalf of <ORG> for the purchase of securities and his entering into crose contracts with the same firm of brokers for the sale of those securities on behalf of <ORG> but admitted that he knew that <NAME> was doing business for the purchase and sale of securities on behalf of <ORG> <NAME> however made a statement at the close of the day when he had made the above statement and said In answer to question No I want to state that I did not start business of <ORG> in or the beginning of but only intended to start that business If he had made enquiries he would have learnt about the nature of receipts and payments and in fact we are inclined to the view that he must have known of their nature and that it is not reasonable that he would be completely in the dark We may now deal with the case of <ORG> appellants The fact that the funds of <ORG> were diverted to Union Agencies by the transactions proved by the prosecution is not challenged by <ORG> There is however ample evidence to indicate that <ORG> knew of the scheme of the transactions and was a party to the scheme inasmuch as the transactions were carried through under his instructions and approval The facts which have a bearing on this matter are Dalmia had the clearest motive to devise means for meeting the losses of the Union Agencies He had knowledge of the losses of <ORG> The return showed that the transfer had taken place on January The inference drawn by the <ORG> below from these circumstances is that <ORG> was the concern of <NAME> and this is reasonable The verbal assertion of the sale having taken place in October is not supported by the entry in Exhibit and what may be taken to be the entries in a similar return for the year When sister in law of <NAME> wanted money it was lent to her out of the funds of <ORG> and in the books of that company no interest was charged from her He had authority to represent <NAME> and <ORG> on the basis of the power of attorney held by him from both The seller had no interest in whose name the sale took place so long as he gets the money for the shares he was selling Further the charge said that he committed criminal breach of trust of the funds of <ORG> by wilfully suffering <NAME> to dishonestly misappropriate them and dishonestly use them or dispose of them in violation of the directions of law and the implied contract existing between <NAME> and <ORG> prescribing the mode in which such trust was to be discharged We are therefore of opinion that firstly the evidence is adequate to establish that <NAME> and <ORG> can be said to be interchangeable and secondly that even if that is not possible to say <NAME> had sufficient motive on account of his intimate relations with <ORG> for committing breach of trust and thirdly that the second finding does not in any way adversely affect the establishment of the offence under I against <NAME> even though the charge described the utilisation of the money in a somewhat different manner There is no doubt that in the first instance it would be <ORG> as a company which would suffer in its credit and its activities There is evidence on record that if the losses are not promptly paid the defaulter would suffer in credit and may not be able to persuade the brokers to enter into contracts with him He could have been employed by <ORG> who bad great confidence in him and whom he had been serving faithfully for a long time There is evidence of his good reputation but much of it must have been the result of his association with <ORG> and his concerns It is significant even though there is no evidence about the content of the conversations that there had been frequent calls during the period of the losses in August and September between <ORG> telephone and that of <NAME> at Bombay The only thing that he had to do in connection with further contingencies of demands for losses was to send for securities from Delhi when the funds at Bombay were low The fact remains that a number of securities were sent from Delhi to Bombay under the directions of <NAME> when there was no apparent reason to send them other than the need to meet losses incurred or expected <ORG> informed <ORG> at Delhi about his power to deal with securities on September though he had that power from September itself It came down to Rs There is no clear evidence as to how they Went from Delhi to Bombay It has been urged that they could have been redeemed at Delhi and that they need not have been sent by <NAME> on his own a couple of months earlier It is to be noticed that what was sent were the stock certificates and it might have been necessary to get the securities covered by those certificates for the purpose of redemption and that might have taken time <NAME> has stated that he authorised <NAME> to purchase securities in about October when he was to leave for abroad and that thereafter <NAME> had been purchasing and selling securities in the exercise of that authority without consulting him It is urged for him that <NAME> statement that be used to obtain confirmation of the purchase and sale of the securities from him cannot be true as there was no necessity for such confirmation The <ORG> did not give any such authority to <NAME> and if the system of joint signatures was introduced for the reason alleged there seems to be no good reason why the <ORG> itself did not resolve that <NAME> be empowered to sell and purchase securities <NAME> states that when he received no reply to his letter dated November asking for distinctive numbers of securities not received at headquarters <NAME> further states that on March when he spoke to <NAME> about the non receipt of certain securities <NAME> told him that he had already instructed <NAME> for the conversion of those securities into stock certificates and that it was in view of this statement of <NAME> that he had written letter Exhibit to <NAME> stating therein There was thus no need for sending these securities from Delhi <ORG> securities are gift edged securities and there is very small fluctuation in these In this connection reference may be made to <NAME> statement in answer to question in cross examination The frequency of transactions relating to purchase and sale of securities depends upon the share market and its trends His answer was that was so but that it also depended on the character of the company making the investment in securities <ORG> states that he contacted <NAME> for the first time on September the last day of the mourning and then learnt from <NAME> that the securities were not in existence the money withdrawn for their purchase having been lent to <ORG> The various statements made by <ORG> in these circumstances and his conduct go to show that he had a guilty mind and when he made the statement to <NAME> that the securities would be produced within two days he trusted that he would be persuasive enough for the auditors to pass the accounts without further insistence on the production of those securities There was no need to avoid meeting him and miss the opportunity of explaining fully what <NAME> had done without his own knowledge <NAME> has admitted that he sent his relations to Mr <NAME> and has also admitted that what they stated to Mr <NAME> was under his instructions It is clear that these persons decided not to disclose to Mr <NAME> that the securities were not in stock because they were not actually purchased and the amount shown to be spent on them was lent to the Union Agencies It is said that he never made that statement but in certain circumstances he asked the Investigator to write what he considered proper and that he signed what <NAME> recorded He did not directly state but it was suggested in cross examination of <NAME> and in his written statement that he made that statement as a result of inducement and promise held out by either <NAME> of <NAME> the other partner of He has given his version both in his statement recorded under Cr <NAME> went out of the office but returned within ten minutes and said that he would make the statement and it be record <NAME> states that no threat or inducement or promise was offered to <NAME> before he made these statements He denied that <NAME> told him that he had no personal knowledge of the securities and that the only information he had from <NAME> was that the latter had given money on loan to the Union Agencies <NAME> denied that he told <NAME> that he would not be prosecuted if he made the statements Exhibit and and deposited He did not consider it proper to reduce to writing every word of what transpired between him and <NAME> from the moment of the latter arrival in his office till the time of his departure and considered it proper to reduce in writing the statement which was made with regard to the missing securities He further stated that his statement above <NAME> making statements Exhibits and voluntarily was on account of the facts that <NAME> himself volunteered to make those statements and that he himself had offered no inducements or promises In cross examination by Mr <NAME> he denied that he told <NAME> that as Chairman of <ORG> he should own responsibility for the missing securities and that would make him a greater <NAME> because he was prepared to pay for the short fall and further denied that it was on account of the suggested statement that <NAME> had asked for two hours time before making his statement He also denied the suggestion that <NAME> told him and <NAME> on September at their office that be had no knowledge of the missing securities that it appeared that the securities had either been sold or pledged and that the money had been paid to the Union Agencies which <NAME> did not like and that in the interest of the policy holders and <ORG> <NAME> was prepared to pay the amount of the short fall of securities and also that when <NAME> spoke about the securities being sold or pledged He denied that he told <NAME> that if he took personal responsibility in the matter it would be only then that no action would be taken and stated that he and <NAME> were nobody to give any assurance to <NAME> His version of what took place may now be quoted answer to question No in his own words What actually happened was that I told <NAME> that I had learnt from <NAME> that the amount of the missing securities had been lent temporarily on behalf of <ORG> by Shri <NAME> to <ORG> and that the amount had been lost in speculation <NAME> then remarked that the Government attached great importance to the interests of the policy holders and that if the matter got undue publicity it would cause a great loss to the policy holders Paragraph really gives the version of what took place in <NAME> office We refer only to such portions of this version as do not find a place either in the suggestions made to <NAME> and <NAME> in their cross examination or in the statement of <NAME> under a or which be inconsistent with either of them <NAME> stated that he told <NAME> that the money that had been received by <ORG> as loan belonged to <ORG> and it appeared that <ORG> had lost that money in speculation They added that <NAME> has been appointed as Investigator by the Government and therefore their words carry weight with the Government that it was my responsibility being the Chairman and Principal Officer of <ORG> to pay the money After signing when I read it I pointed out to them that they had not written that I wanted to pay every pie of the policy holders and then they wrote as I told them and I signed His statement How could I have acted in such a way without any positive assurances implies that he did make the statements though on getting assurances Of course after he had made the statement there was no necessity of asking anything further He has recorded my statement wherein I have admitted the short fall of the securities <NAME> did not admit but simply said that <NAME> did tell him something when he was questioned as to whether <NAME> told him that he had been told by <NAME> and <NAME> that if he had made the statement in accordance with their desire there would be no trouble When question No was put to him with reference to this statement of <NAME> he simply stated that he had briefly told <NAME> with regard to what bad transpired between him and Khanna and Annadhanam and that he had told <NAME> that he need not worry The various statements of <NAME> suggesting that inducement was held out to him by <NAME> have not been believed by the Courts below and we see no good reason to differ from their view There was no reason for <NAME> to record an incriminating statement like and get it signed by <NAME> He therefore made a statement that he had misappropriated the securities and immediately offered to make good the loss through his relatives He made the statement when he felt cornered on account of the knowledge that <NAME> had the authority of law to question and thought that the only manner of postponing the evil consequence of his act was by making the statement which would soften the attitude of the authorities towards him The expression used was not such that <NAME> even if he had a poor knowledge of English could not have used It cannot be expected that every word was used in that statement in the strict legal sense There is nothing on record to justify any conclusion that <NAME> and Mr <NAME> bad colluded and wanted to get a confession from <ORG> <NAME> protested saying that they had already verified the securities and that they as auditors for the year had no right to ask for the inspection of securities in the year There was nothing in this conduct of <ORG> which should have annoyed <NAME> or <NAME> He asked <NAME> on September to see him on the th in connection with the securities of <ORG> He put simple question to <NAME> and that required him to explain about the missing securities So long as <NAME> did not make a statement in that connection it was not necessary to make any record of the talk which might take place between the two In fact <NAME> had stated that the word discussion used by him in his supplementary interim report Exhibit really be read as recording of the statement of Shri <NAME> and the talk he had with when he came to <NAME> office and which he had with him while going to the staircase There was therefore no question of <NAME> allowing any time to <NAME> for pondering over the pros and cons of his making a statement about whose nature and effect he would have had no idea Section of the Indian Penal Code has no application to the examination of <NAME> under of the Insurance Act Section reads Whoever being legally bound to give any notice or to furnish information on any subject to any public servant as such inten tionally omits to give such notice or to furnish such information in the manner and at the time required by law shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees or with both or if the notice or information required to be given respects the commission of an offence or is required for the purpose of preventing the commission of an offence or in order to the apprehension of an offender with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees or with both or if the notice or information required to be given is required by an order passed under sub section of section of the Code of Criminal Procedure with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees We believe the statements of <NAME> and <NAME> about <NAME> making the statement Exhibit without his being induced or threatened by them <NAME> was not in duress at the time he made that statement and therefore was not compelled to make it It was said in the aforesaid case Compulsion in the context must mean what in law is called duress The compulsion in this sense is a physical ob jective act and not the state of mind of the person making the statement except where the mind has been so conditioned by some extraneous process as to render the making of the statement involuntary and therefore extorted the statement finds support from the facts established by other evidence that the speculation business carried on by <ORG> was really the business of <NAME> himself though ostensibly it was the business of the company of which there were a few shareholders other than <NAME> We have considered the objection and are of opinion that there is no case for raising such an inference against the prosecution The extent of shares <ORG> held in these companies had no direct bearing on the matter under inquiry in the case The prosecution led evidence about the telephonic calls up to August and did not lead evidence about the calls between September and September It is not therefore essential for the prosecution to have led evidence of telephonic calls between <ORG> and <NAME> during this period On that point there had been sufficient evidence led by the prosecution The accused could have summoned it if he had particular reason to rely on its entries to prove his case Again there is oral evidence with respect to such despatch of securities and it was not essential for the prosecution to produce the docu ments in that connection We therefore see no force in this contention It is urged for <ORG> that he could not have been a party to a scheme which would cause loss to <ORG> because he was mainly responsible for the prosperity of the company There was the risk of detection of the fraud to be committed and so <ORG> would have acted differently with respect to such affairs of <ORG> as have been used as evidence of <ORG> being synonymous with it We are of opinion that these considerations are not such which would off set the inferences arrived at from the proved facts It cannot be it matter of mere coincidence that frequent telephonic conversations took place between <ORG> and <NAME> when <ORG> suffered losses that the usual purchase transactions by which the funds of <ORG> were diverted to <ORG> took place then that such purchases should recur several times during the relevant period that such securities which could not be recouped had to be shown as sold and when <ORG> or <ORG> could not pay for the sale price which had to be credited to the account of <ORG> a further usual purchase transaction took place It is clear that he had a dishonest intention to cause at least temporary loss of its funds to <ORG> and gain to the <ORG> This could be achieved only as a result of the conspiracy between him and <NAME> The result of all such entries in the vouchers Was that on paper it appeared in the case of credit advices that <ORG> advanced money to <ORG> which paid the money to <ORG> which in its turn paid the money to <ORG> and in the case of debit advices <ORG> debited the amount to Delhi Office of <ORG> and that debited it to <ORG> which in its turn debited it to <ORG> Each of them is addressed to <ORG> and states that the amount mentioned therein was the amount received by the former i <ORG> from <ORG> on account of the latter i <ORG> on January and January respectively and adjusted Other facts which throw light on the deliberate preparation of these false vouchers are that there had been tampering of the ledger of <ORG> in <ORG> and also in the journal statement of that office The entries did show the receipt of the amounts from <ORG> but the prosecution case was that the amount was received in cash and not through transfers which transactions had to be adjusted The learned Sessions Judge did not however believe the statement of Sri <NAME> who investigated the case that he had noticed these alterations earlier than his statement in Court Which was some time in for the reason that <NAME> was not questioned by the prosecution in this regard and no reference was made by Sri <NAME> in the case diary about his questioning <NAME> about the alterations If his earlier answer is correct that would indicate that either <NAME> had supplied the office with the fictitious cash statement of <ORG> as alleged by the prosecution or that seeing in the journal cash statement that the entry related to <ORG> deliberately told <NAME> in accordence with the scheme to debit that amount to <ORG> In either view of the matter this conduct of <NAME> in advising <NAME> to debit the amount to <ORG> is sufficient to indicate his complicity in the whole scheme as otherwise he had no reason to behave in that manner <NAME> among the accused must have been chosen for the purpose of the conspiracy because he had connection both with <ORG> and with <ORG> He had been in the employ of a <ORG> concern from long before It could not have been possible for the prosecution to lead direct evidence about <NAME> knowledge with respect to the full working of the scheme to provide for the losses of <ORG> from the funds of <ORG> Mr <NAME> for <NAME> has urged that <NAME> could have had nothing to do with the diversion of the funds of <ORG> to the Union Agencies even though he was a Director of the latter as he never issued instructions regarding the activities of the Union Agencies had no knowledge of the passing of money from the funds of <ORG> to the Union Agencies as he had nothing to do with the movement of the securities held by <ORG> or the receipt of cash or the other transactions his role having begun according to the prosecution after the offence under Mr <NAME> Dear Sir I have to inform you that the various a mounts arranged by me as temporary loans to <ORG> Bombay Office from time to time in the name of <ORG> actually represented the monies relating to the undernoted securitiesbelonging to <ORG> I have now to request you to please arrange at your earliest to pay about Rs I am getting this letter also signed by <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> although he had neither any knowledge of these transactions nor had any connection with these affairs There is inherent evidence in this letter to support this view Even if it was written on September it was written at a time when the matter of securities had come to the notice of the authorities and <ORG> was being pressed to satisfactorily explain the position of the securities Mr <NAME> has however urged that the contract for the purchase of these securities had taken place on September and that therefore <ORG> did not include those securities in this letter Reference is made to the statement of <ORG> a partner of the Firm <ORG> in Shares and securities requires the officer in charge of the police station to forward to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report the report in the prescribed form setting forth the names of the parties the nature of the information and the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case We have already dealt with this matter There was no such allegation on the basis of the statement of any prosecution witness No such question could have been put to him when there was no evidence about it They were sent to <NAME> personally It is submitted that an intent to defraud connotes an intention to deceive and make the person deceived suffer some loss that the entries made in the journal vouchers did not make anyone suffer and therefore the entries could not be said to have been made with intent to defraud ulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud and not otherwise And again at page Where therefore there is an intention to obtain an advantage by deceit there is fraud and if a document is fabricated with such intent it is forgery It requires no argument to demonstrate that steps taken and devices adopted with a view to prevent persons already defrauded from ascertaining that fraud had been perpetrated on them and thus to enable the person who practiced the fraud to retain the illicit gain which he secured by the fraud amount to the commission of a fraud We agree with this observation and repel the contention for the appellant There is no question of immediate or remote connection with the commission of breach of trust which is sought to be covered up by the falsification so long as the falsification is to cover that up It was however not mentioned in the grounds of appeal We therefore dismiss these appeals
