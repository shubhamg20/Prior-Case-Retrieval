SAMUNDRI DEVI DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH OZA BENCH OZA MUKHARJI SABYASACHI CITATION AIR SCR SCC JT SCALE CITATOR INFO SC SC SC RF SC SC ACT Landlord tenant matter Provisions of Urban Buildings Regulation of Letting Rent and Eviction Act Sections Applicability thereof to the case Protection granted to the tenants under the Act Whether available to the tenants in the case Provisions of Sections and are of no avail to the appellants as the suit for their eviction was not pending on July when the Act came into force the suit being filed much later after coming into force of the Act Provisions of the Act are not applicable to the appellants case and the protection thereunder granted to the tenants is not available to them This appeal arises out of a judgment passed by <ORG> in Civil Revision No of wherein the learned Judge of <ORG> allowed the revision petition set aside the judgment and decree of the Trial Judge and decreed the plaintiff suit for ejectment of the appellant The suit was filed for eviction after termination of tenancy before the trial court and objection was raised that as the shop and the basement were separately let out the tenancy could not be terminated by a single notice that would be invalid <ORG> after discussing various decisions came to the conclusion that in view of the language of Section sub clause Explanation it could not be doubted that period of years will commence from the date of assessment i October that it is in that view of the matter that the learned Judge of the <ORG> decreed the suit and hence the present appeal If it could be passed on anyone of the grounds mentioned in Section clause of this Act in support of this contention the learned counsel placed reliance on decisions in <NAME> etc On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent contended that the rights of parties will be governed on the basis of the date on which the suit was filed and it was contended that if on the date on which the suit was filed by the respondent the provisions of this Act were not applicable then merely because the proceedings have been pending for all these years it could not be contended that as now years elapsed the decree could not be passed Learned counsel further contended that in the decision in <NAME> case supra on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the appellant the Firms Amar Naath Basheshar Dass case supra has not been referred to and decision in <NAME> case supra is a judgment by a Bench of two Judges It was also contended by learned counsel that as till the matter was pending in <ORG> years have not been completed and therefore <ORG> passed the decree Now it could not be contended that as during the pendency of the proceedings in this Court years have elapsed and therefore the appellant tenant will be entitled to protection of the provisions of Section It was contended that it is well settled that if the right to file a suit accrues on the date of tiling of the suit then the rights will have to be determined on the basis of the law applicable on the date of the suit and not subsequently Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the decision in Firms <NAME> case supra will not be applicable to the present case as in that case this <ORG> was considering the language of a notification issued under the East Punjab Act exempting buildings from the operation of the Act for five years and the view taken by this <ORG> in that decision is based on the language of the notification issued whereas in view of the language of Sections and of the Act which is applicable to the present case that view is not possible and it is because of this that in <NAME> case supra this <ORG> took the view that if during the pendency of the proceedings years have elapsed the tenant will be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Act Before this Court also the only question that was raised on behalf of the parties was as to whether the provisions of the Act will be applicable or not and as to whether the protection granted to the tenants under this Act will be available to the present appellant Learned counsel for the appellant contended that as during the pendency of this matter in this Court years have elapsed even if the date of completion is taken to be has been crossed now the period of exemption has come to an end and therefore the appellant is entitled to the benefits thereof of the Act reads as under Except as provided in sub section of Section sub section A of Section sub section of Section Sections A or sub section of Section nothing in this Act shall apply to a building during a period of ten years from the date on which its construction is completed Provided that where any building is constructed substantially out of funds obtained by way of loan or advance from <ORG> or <ORG> or a bank or a co operative society or <ORG> and the period of repayment of such loan or advance exceeds the aforesaid period of ten years then the reference in this sub section to the period of ten years shall be deemed to be a reference to the period of fifteen years or the period ending with the date of actual repayment of such loan or advance including interest whichever is shorter Explanation I For the purposes of this sub section a the construction of a building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which the completion thereof is reported to or otherwise recorded by the local authority having jurisdiction and in the case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said dates and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied not including occupation merely for the purposes of supervising the construction or guarding the building under construction for the first time Provided that there may be different dates of completion of construction in respect of different parts of a building which are either designed as separate units or are occupied separately by the landlord and one or more tenants or by different tenants construction includes any new construction in place of an existing building which has been wholly or substantially demolished where such substantial addition is made to an existing building that the existing building becomes only a minor part thereof the whole of the building including the existing building shall be deemed to be constructed on the date of completion of the said addition This period of years have to be computed in the manner from the date as indicated in Explanation and it was contended by learned counsel for the respondents that it will be the date on which the first assessment was made and so far as this question is concerned it is also concluded by a decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra where it has been clearly held while interpreting Sec Explanation I of this Act that if there is an assessment made then the date of completion of the building the date from which years are to be computed will be the date on which the first assessment was made But apart from it the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant was that because of the language of Section and even if the matter is pending in this Court and years have elapsed appellant will be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this Act because according to him the appeal will be a continuation of the suit and therefore the advantage will be available Pending suits for eviction relating to buildings brought under regulation for the first time In any suit for eviction of a tenant from any building to which the old Act did not apply pending on the date of commencement of this Act where the tenant within one month from such date of commencement or from the date of his knowledge of the pendency of the suit whichever be later deposits in the court before which the suit is pending the entire amount of rent and damages for use and occupation such damages for use and occupation being calculated at the same rate as rent together with interest thereon at the rate of nine cent per annum and the landlord full cost of the suit no decree for eviction shall be passed except on any of the grounds mentioned in the proviso to sub section or in clauses A to of sub section of Section and the parties shall be entitled to make necessary amendment in their pleadings and to adduce additional evidence where necessary Provided that a tenant the rent payable by whom does not exceed twenty five rupees per month need not deposit any interest as aforesaid It is pertinent to note that this Section applies to those suits which were pending on the date of the commencement of this Act Admittedly this Act came into force on th July and therefore if the suit was pending on that date it is only then that the provisions of Section will come to the assistance of the tenant appellant Admittedly this suit was not pending on the date on which this Act came into force An attempt was made to contend that so far as the present property is concerned the Act will be deemed to have come into force on the expiry of years i but this contention could not be accepted as it is very clear from the language of this Act that it applied I only to a suit pending on the date of the commencement of this Act and this is the view taken in <NAME> case wherein it was observed Further in order to attract section the suit must be pending on the date of commencement of the Act which is th of July but the suit giving rise to the present appeal was filed on rd of March long after the commencement of the Act There is yet another reason why section will have no application to the present case This Section talks of the pendency of a revision or an appeal arising out of a suit pending on the day on which this Act came into force It is clear that provisions of Section will come to the rescue of the appellant tenant only if the suit from which revision or appeal arose was pending on the date of commencement of this Act i and therefore it could not be contended that the present revision petition or the appeal either to <ORG> or the appellate authority arose out of suit which was pending on the date on which this Act came into force It is well settled that the rights of the parties will be determined on the basis of the rights available to them on the date of the suit but in <NAME> case supra this Court took the view that if during the pendency of the proceedings years have elapsed the tenant is entitled to the protection under the Act and in coming to this conclusion the Court also considered the language of Section of the Act and it observed The appellant in the present case only seeks the protection of the new Rent Act which became applicable to the premises in question during the pendency the litigation We see no reason why the benefit of the new Rent Act be not given to the appellant Section and of the new Rent Act also indicate that the benefit of new Act will be given to the tenant if the conditions contemplated in those sections are satisfied Bar of suit for eviction of tenant except on specified grounds Save as provided in sub section no suit shall be instituted for the eviction of a tenant from a building notwithstanding the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time or on the expiration of a notice to quit or in any other manner Provided that nothing in this sub section shall bar a suit for the eviction of a tenant on the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time where the tenancy for a fixed term was entered into by or in pursuance of a compromise or adjustment arrived at with reference to a suit appeal revision or execution proceedings which is either recorded in court or otherwise reduced to writing and signed by the tenant This is put in Chapter IV with the heading Regulation and Eviction and the section starts with title which is printed in bold Bar of suit for eviction of tenant except on specified grounds and again in the wording of the section itself it provides No suit shall be instituted for eviction This clearly indicates that the restriction put under Section is to the institution of the suit itself and therefore it is clear that if the provisions of this Act applies then no suit for eviction can be instituted except on the grounds specified in the sub sections of this Section Keeping in view the language of this Section if we examine the provisions contained in sub section of Section it will be clear that for a newly constructed building the provisions of this Act will not apply for years and therefore so far as the restriction under Section is concerned they will not apply and therefore it is clear that within years as provided for in clause of Section restriction of the institution of suit as provided for in Section clause quoted above will not be applicable and it is thus clear that during the pendency of the litigation even of years expired the restriction will not be attracted as the suit has been instituted within years and therefore restriction as provided for in Section can not be attracted In the light of the discussions above therefore in our opinion the contention advanced by learned counsel for the appellant can not be accepted In default the respondent shall be entitled to execute the decree forthwith In the circumstances of the case parties are directed to bear their own costs
