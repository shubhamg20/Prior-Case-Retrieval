This appeal was dismissed by an order made by us which reads as under Having heard Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the appellant and Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the respondents we dismiss A No and vacate all interim orders made by this <ORG> By that time the promised equitable mortgage by the <ORG> was created in favour of the <ORG> There is some dispute between the parties about when the intimation about the resolution of the appellant was conveyed to the respondent but that is hardly relevant Mr <NAME> learned Counsel who appeared for the appellant urged that the sanctioning of the loan by the <ORG> in favour of the respondent was conditional upon the <ORG> undertaking to refinance the loan and as <ORG> declined to re finance the loan the <ORG> cannot be compelled by a mandamus to grant the loan It was also incidentally urged that the dispute raised between the parties is in the realm of contract and at best the <ORG> can be charged with breach of contract for which the remedy is by way of damages or any other remedy available to the respondent for breach of contract but in any case a writ of mandamus cannot be issued compelling the <ORG> to perform its part of the contract There is no merit in either of the contentions The first contention of Mr <NAME> appearing for the appellant is that the sanctioning of the loan by the <ORG> in favour of the respondent was conditional upon <ORG> agreeing to and undertaking to re finance the loan and as <ORG> has declined for the time being to re finance the loan the <ORG> cannot be compelled to undertake the onerous liability of financing a huge loan to one undertaking and therefore the appellant was discharged from performing its part of the contract In this connection a reference to Clauses and of the letter dated July by the appellant to the respondent setting out the terms and conditions subject to which loan was sanctioned would be advantageous It was next contended that the dispute between the parties is in the realm of contract and even if there was a concluded contract between the parties about grant and acceptance of loan the failure of the <ORG> to carry out its part of the obligation may amount to breach of contract for which a remedy lies elsewhere but a writ of mandamus cannot be issued compelling the <ORG> to specifically perform the contract It was not disputed and in fairness to Mr <NAME> it must be said that he did not dispute that the <ORG> which is set up under Section of the <ORG> Financial <ORG> Act is an instrumentality of the <ORG> and would be other authority under Article of the Constitution the appellant entered into a solemn agreement in performance of its statutory duty to advance the loan of Rs this Court observed as under The true principle of promissory estoppel therefore seems to be that where one party has by his words of conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any pre existing relationship between the parties or not Thus the principle of promissory estoppel would certainly estop the <ORG> from backing out of its obligation arising from a solemn promise made by it to the respondent which slightly differs from the view taken by this Court in the aforementioned decision at any rate would not help the appellant because it only lays down that the principle of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing the <ORG> from discharging its functions under the law Even then it was held that when the officer authorised under a scheme enters into an agreement and makes a representation and a person acting on that representation puts himself in a disadvantageous position the Court is entitled to regulate the officer to act according to the scheme and the agreement or the representation Viewing the matter from a slightly different angle altogether it would appear that the appellant is acting in a very un reasonable manner Now if appellant entered into a solemn contract in discharge and performance of its statutory duty and the respondent acted upon it the statutory corporation can not be allowed to act arbitrarily so as to cause harm and injury flowing from its un reasonable conduct to the respondent
