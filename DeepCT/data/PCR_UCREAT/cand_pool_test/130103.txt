The case of the complainant union was that the workmen who were working in one of the canteens of the respondent company were not given the service conditions as were available to the other workmen of the company and there was also a threat of termination of their services It is an admitted fact that these workmen were employed by a contractor who was given a contract to run the canteen in question The com plaint however was filed on the footing that the workmen were the employees of the company and therefore the breach committed and the threats of retrenchments were cognizable by <ORG> under the said Act Even in the complaint there was no case made out that the workmen in question had ever been accepted by the company as its employees However the complaint proceeded on the basis as if the workmen were a part of the work force of the company The facts on record reveal that the workmen were never recognised by the respondent company as its workmen and it was the consistent contention of the company that they were not its employees We therefore find nothing wrong in the decision impugned before us
