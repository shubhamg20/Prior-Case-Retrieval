The two questions that were referred to us by <ORG> under Section of the Indian income tax Act are as follows It carried on the business of producing and distributing aims So far as the lump sum contracts are concerned it is also found that the assessee did not part with the picture until the amount was paid to him at the time of the delivery of the picture in the native State either by sending the railway receipt by or by tendering the film directly to the exhibitor or perhaps even by sending the railway receipt to a bank for collection On these facts it was contended strenuously on behalf of the department by Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the Income tax Commissioner that as the contracts which are the source of the profit were entered into In British India it must be held that in respect of both the types of contracts the profits accrued in British India and not in a native State It therefore follows that in respect of both the types of contracts the profits of the business accrued wholly in a native State and they are therefore exempt under the third proviso to Section of the Excess Profits Tax Act We searched in vain to find any trace of this argument before any of the Income tax authorities who had to deal with this matter it is not a question which has been referred to us by <ORG> nor did the Income tax Commissioner ask for a reference of this question to this Court That may be so but we have to understand the questions referred to us in the light of the statement of facts and the statement of the case which have been the basis of the reference to this Court In these circumstances it is impossible to hold that it is a question which arises out of the order of <ORG> and which is covered by the questions that are actually referred to us It will be wholly inconvenient to allow such a question to be raised for the first time before us without an investigation of the facts and also without an apportionment of the profits by the department In these circumstances we must answer the questions referred to us by the <ORG> in favour of the assessee and in the affirmative
