Earlier the appellants had also filed a classification list of another product described as Halls Mentholyptus Tablets claiming assessment of the same under Tariff sub heading chargeable The respondents before the lower authorities pleaded that they were manufacturing a product <ORG> Icemint Tablets under a licence issued to them by the Director <ORG> and claimed that taking into account the nature of the ingredients used the same was correctly assessable as Ayurvedic medicine at nil rate of duty In the order the Assistant Collector has stated that Director Indian Medicine and Homeopathy has issued licence for manufacture of the Halls Ice Mint Tablets but there is no evidence that the same are being used or marketed Therefore there is no doubt that the Medicaments are used in Ayurvedic system and accordingly the clas sification claimed under Tariff sub heading in correct and approved These three Tariff headings for convenience of reference are reproduced below MEDICAMENTS INCLUDING VETERINARY MEDICAMENTS Patent or proprietary medicaments other than those medicaments which are exclusively Ayurvedic Unani Siddha Homoeopathic or Biochemic Other Medicaments including those used in Ayurvedic Unani Siddha Homoeopathic or Biochemic systems Nil SUGAR CONFECTIONERY INCLUDING WHITE CHOCOLATE NOT CONTAINING COCOA Other He pleaded there is nothing on record to show that the produce has been manufactured exactly on Ayurvedic Siddha Unani systems of medicines He pleaded that the goods were assessable under Tariff Item and in this connection he drew our attention to the Explanatory Note Vol He also drew our attention to Explanatory Note under Chapter of the said nomenclature at page under which the pastilles of specific variety are excluded So far as the literature is concerned he drew the attention of the Bench to the packing in which the tablets are sold He pleaded that as there is no evidence on record to show that the goods manufactured by the appellants are Ayurvedic medicines He referred to the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> ELT He pointed out that ratio of this decision has a bearing on this case so far as the application of the common parlance criteria is concerned inasmuch as the issue has been decided in that case in this context after taking note of the ingredients used The points that fall for consideration in these proceedings are whether un product manufactured by the appellants are a medicine and if so whether it is assessable as a patent and proprietary medicine chargeable to duty or as an Ayurvedic medicine chargeable to nil rate of duty Obviously the Certificate of Dr <NAME> is not based on his first hand information There is no mention in the certificate that the information is based on the analysis of the tablets done by Dr <NAME> or any clinical trials that he may have carried out It is seen that Dr <NAME> is a Professor of Surgery of ENT and he cannot be considered as a specialist in the field of medicine The certificate which could be taken note of is the one issued by the competent authority which in this case could be only DGHS of <ORG> We observe that for any formulation to be considered as medicine the same should be either recognised so in a standard Ayurvedic work or should be so proved by clinical trials or should be recognised so by an authority like <ORG> The appellants case for considering the goods as medicine is only based on one fact that the active ingredients namely Pudina which in fact is menthol and Euclyptus oil are Ayurvedic in nature and these have medicinal properties As it is there is no claim made by the respondents that the sic tion of the throat or alleviating the suffering caused by certain infections of the throat or are prophylactic in nature The claim made by the respondents does not show that the tablets have been formulated as a medicine for treating any specified condition or alleviation of any suffering caused by some pathatogenic conditionof the throat They have not produced any evidence from the trade to show that these tablets have been marketed and accepted as medicine The facts of the present case are therefore distinguishable from the facts cited in <ORG> case so far as pleas made by the respondents are concerned We observe that once the tablets are held to be not a medicament falling under Chapter the next item which falls for consideration is We observe from the interpretative rules for interpretation of the Central Excise Schedule which are statutory in nature that under the interpretative Rule the tablets will fall within the ambit of interpretative Rule In view of the above we allow the appeal of the <ORG> in the above terms
