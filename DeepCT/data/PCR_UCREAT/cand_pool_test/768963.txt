sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner Dismissing the petition under Article of the Constitution HELD If the order of detention purports to be based on the satisfaction of the detaining authority that it is necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the <ORG> it would clearly be an invalid order If it appears in the present case that the order of detention made by the District Magistrate was based on the satisfaction that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view preventing him from carrying on activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or the security of the <ORG> it would have to be struck down as invalid But there is no such infirmity in the order of detention In the first place Hindi being the official language of the <ORG> it is the Hindi version of the grounds of detention which must be regarded as authentic and the validity of the detention must be judged with reference to the Hindi version of the grounds and not the English version Secondly even on the English version of the grounds of detention it is clear that at the end of each of the grounds it is stated in so many words that the acts of the petitioner were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and there is no reference to prejudice to the security of the

detailed and elaborate particulars and they are sufficiently informative so as to provide more than adequate opportunity to the petitioner to make an effective representation iii What the District Magistrate meant to say by using the expression It would not be possible to give details of such instances was that instances of this nature were so many that one could not possibly have details of all of them but there were a few before him by way of illustration and since he had relied on them for arriving at the requisite satisfaction he proceeded to reproduce them in grounds to The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The petitioner who is an advocate practising in the courts in Dhanbad in the State of Bihar has filed the present petition challenging the validity of an order of detention dated th March made by the District Magistrate Dhanbad under section of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act On March the petitioner made an application to the Sub Divisional Magistrate for being released on bail but no immediate order was passed on that application and the petitioner was therefore constrained to move the Sessions Judge for bail on th March On the same day that is th March the District Magistrate Dbanbad passed an order detaining the petitioner under section of the Act on the ground that it was necessary to do so with a view to preventing the petitioner from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order The order of detention was in Hindi which is the official language of the State of Bihar but there was also an English version of the order of detention There was no material difference between the Hindi and English versions of the order of detention Pursuant to the order of detention the petitioner was arrested on st March as soon as he was released on bail in compliance with the order of release passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate and at the time of his arrest the Hindi as well as English versions of the order of detention were served on him together with the grounds of detention which were also in Hindi and English versions Then the Hindi version proceeded to recite the satisfaction of the District Magistrate that in the circumstances he was satisfied that if the petitioner is allowed to remain at large he will indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and for prevention of such activities he considered the detention of the petitioner necessary It stated that the District Magistrate was satisfied that if the petitioner is allowed to remain at large he will indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the State and for prevention of such activities he considered the detention of the petitioner necessary <ORG> gave an opportunity to the petitioner to be person ally heard and after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case gave its opinion on nd May that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner The petitioner thereupon filed the present petition in this Court under Art The first ground on which the validity of his detention was challenged on behalf of the petitioner was that the English version of the grounds of detention recited that the District Magistrate was satisfied that if the petitioner was allowed to remain at large he would indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the <ORG> Where however the distinctive or is used instead of the conjunctive and it would mean that the detaining authority was either not certain whether the alleged activities of the petitioner endangered public order or the security of the <ORG> or it did not seriously apply its mind to the question whether such activities fell under one head or the other and merely reproduced mechanically the language of section a ii If therefore it appears in the present case that the order of detention made by the District Magistrate was based on the satisfaction that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from carrying on activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or the security of the St ate it would have to be struck down as invalid But we do not find that there is any such infirmity in the order of detention Whether we look at the Hindi version or the English version the satisfaction which is recited in the order of detention and on which the order of detention is manifestly and avowedly based is that it is necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order There is no reference to the security of the <ORG> in the recital of the satisfaction contained in the order of detention The District Magistrate was satisfied that it was necessary to detain the petitioner only on the ground that his activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and it was on the basis of this satisfaction that he made the order of detention In the first place Hindi being the official language of the <ORG> it is the Hindi version of the grounds of detention which must be regarded as authentic and the validity of the detention must be judged with reference to the Hindi version of the grounds of detention and not the English version Secondly even if we confine ourselves to the English version of the grounds of detention it is clear that at the end of each of the grounds it is stated in so many words that the acts of the petitioner were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and there is no reference there to prejudice to the security of the <ORG> and it is only in the conclusion based on these acts that we find a recital of the satisfaction that if the petitioner is allowed to remain at large he would indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or the security of the <ORG> We cannot invalidate the order of detention on the basis of such an obvious error ignoring the order of detention in both its Hindi and English versions the Hindi version of the grounds of detention and the totality of the context so far as the English version is concerned We do not see any force in this contention In fact the District Magistrate gave not less than five instances containing detailed and elaborate particulars and they were sufficiently informative so as to provide more than adequate opportunity to the petitioner to made an effective representation The next ground urged on behalf of the petitioner was that the District Magistrate had taken into account many more instances than those set out in grounds to and that was apparent from the use of the expression It would not be possible to give details of such instances in ground It is true that the District Magistrate stated in ground that it would not be possible to give details of instances where by reason of instigation and abetment of the petitioner disturbances of public order had taken place but that does not mean that the District Magistrate bad various instances in mind which he took into account in arriving at his subjective satisfaction without disclosing them to the petitioner What the District Magistrate meant to say by using tills expression was that instances of this nature were so many that one could not possibly have details of all of them but there were a few before him by way of illustration and since he bad relied on them for arriving at the requisite satisfaction he proceeded to reproduce them in grounds to It was then contended on behalf of the petitioner that the instance set out in ground could not be regarded as one where communal hatred was propagated by the petitioner either between Adivasis and outsiders or between Adivasis and non Adivasis and it did not therefore justify the inference set out in ground The last ground urged on behalf of the petitioner was that paragraphs and of the affidavit filed by Miss <NAME> Deputy Secretary to <ORG> <ORG> in reply to the petition showed that there were various other materials in regard to the petitioner which were taken into account by the District Magistrate in arriving at his subjective satisfaction and since no opportunity was given to the petitioner to make an affective representation in regard lo such materials the order of detention was bad They were not set out a facts taken into account by the District Magistrate for the purpose of arriving at his subjective satisfaction in regard to the necessity of the detention of the petitioner These were the only grounds urged in support of the petition and since there is no substance in them the petition fails and the rule is discharged
