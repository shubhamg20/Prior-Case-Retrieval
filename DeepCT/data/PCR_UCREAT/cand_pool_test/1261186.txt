The assessee is a partnership firm carrying on A business of its own The Income tax Officer accepted the return as he found it and made an assessment on the basis of the return charging to tax the total income income from the joint venture Subsequently the Commissioner of Income tax initiated proceedings for suo moturevision under section of the Income tax Act on the score that the Income tax officer action in so far as he brought to charge the assessee share income from the joint venture was prejudicial to the interest of the <ORG> This order of the Commissioner of Income tax was confirmed by the <ORG> in appeal The order of the <ORG> has given raise to the present reference The other question was about the powers of the Commissioner of Income tax to interfere with the orders of the Income tax Officer as prejudicial to the interest of the <ORG> All that would remain to be done in such a case would be for the Income tax officer to proceed to deal with the other members shares of income in their respective individual assessments From this conception of the pattern of assessments of the two entities involving an option or an election it was but a natural step for the court to proceed to hold that when once an Income tax Officer had taken a particular course of assessment then not only does he as an assessing officer commits himself to making an assessment in that mode but also commits <ORG> as a whole to the course of action He submitted that association of persons is an abstraction and it merely represents and denotes a group of persons who join together for the purpose of carrying on any transaction or business enabling each one of them to earn a share in the general profits obtained by the association as such The objection against double taxation is a principal unless there are express provisions ought to be construed as negating double taxation Both in the Indian Income tax Act and in the Income tax Act of while there may be no express provision prohibiting double taxation of both of the association and of the members thereof there is no provision which expressly permits the Income tax Officer to tax one and the same income both in the assessment of the association of members and of the constituent members thereafter proceed to assess the association of person as a whole as a unit of assessment Mrs <NAME> learned junior standing counsel for <ORG> submitted that in order that the Income tax officer may be interdicted from proceeding to make an assessment on the association of person following his assessment of the share income of a member thereof there must be a conscious choice made by the Income tax officer of the alternatives before him In such a situation it was urged on behalf of the <ORG> that it would prejudice the <ORG> if the Income tax Officer assessing the share income of one of the members of the association should be held thereby to commit irretrievably the entire department to that course blocking any other venue of assessment as against the association as a whole We do not therefore accept the argument of the learned counsel for the <ORG> that whenever an Income tax officer has taken the step to assess an individual member of the association in respect of his aliquot share then the correctness of his choice of assessment is open to question on an inquiry as to whether he had consciously made that choice having before him all the relevant data therefor or did so accidentally or without an application of his mind Indeed in the order passed by Commissioner of Income tax under section of the Act the Commissioner in so many words had stated that the order of the Income tax officer cannot be said to be not in accordance with the law Section of the Act empowers the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and if he considers that any order passed therein by the Income tax Officer us erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> he may after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made such enquiry as he deems necessary pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment The question is whether the view expressed by the Commissioner of Income tax and the <ORG> are based on a correct understanding of the enabling provisions of section of the Income tax Act and of the nature of the order of assessment passed by the Income tax Officer Section provides a further appeal to the <ORG> against the orders passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in appeal In the sub chapter XX relating to revision by the Commissioner apart from section there is yet another provision under section which confers revisional power on the Commissioner of Income tax This latter revisional power under section enables the Commissioner either suo motu or on application by assessee to interfere in revision with the orders passed by the authorities subordinate to him The language used by the legislature in section is to the effect that the Commissioner may interfere in revision if considers that the order passed by the Income tax Officer is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> It is quite clear from the above phrasing that two things must co exist in order to give jurisdiction to the Commissioner to interfere in revision In the first place there are no materials started in the order of the Commissioner of Income tax to suggest in what way there is any prejudice to the interests of the <ORG> Indeed in one portion of the order the Commissioner had dealt with the argument advanced on behalf of the assessee to the effect that even if the joint venture is to be assessed as such the tax effect may not necessarily be more This is an indication that the Commissioner had not as on that date any clear idea as to what the difference in tax effect would have been if instead of taxing the share income of all the members in their respective hands the <ORG> had first made an assessment on the total income of the association as such in respect of the joint venture business We think it is axiomatic that any assessment which is in accordance with the law cannot at the same breath be regarded as erroneous and if the assessment is not erroneous it cannot be prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> or for that matter to the interests of the assessee as well This is on the principle that nothing can be prejudicial either to the <ORG> or to the assessee if it is in accordance with the law unless it be that the law itself is being questioned on some ground or other which objection is available under some provision or other of the Constitution It denotes some kind of abstraction or symbol in the same sense in which the expression crown is used to distinguish it from any person enthroned The mainspring of action for the Commissioner of Income tax in the present case would seem to be really to circumvent the position of law which has become will settled in the matter of assessment of an association and or the members thereof One way of understanding the reasoning of <ORG> in this case is to say that the Commissioner is not confined to have regard to the particular assessement order before him for the purpose of drawing a inference that order is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> but he can have regard to the repercussions of that order generally in other assessments as well This case was one in which there was an initial assessment made by an Income tax Officer on an association of persons He made the assessment on the assocition brushing aside the objection of the members who urged that the income of the association must be assessed in separate shares in the hands of the constituent members Before <ORG> the Department questioned the powers of <ORG> to cancel the assessment on the association and direct <ORG> to make an assessment of the shares of income in the hands of the members The contention was that option to assess either the association or the members thereof was only with <ORG> and when once he had exercised that option that cannot be interfered with in appeal As we had earlier observed the power conferred on him by this section is in the nature of a supervisory power Such a power cannot in any manner be equated to or regarded as approaching in any way the appellate jurisdiction or even the ordinary revisional power conferred on the Commissioner under section of the Act
