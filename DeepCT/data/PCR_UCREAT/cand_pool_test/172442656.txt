The revision of the seniority list which was challenged before the <ORG> it was submitted was only a corrective action though belated to render justice to the affected persons and is in compliance of the judgment of the Madras Bench of the <ORG> dated October in A No directing disposal of the representation regarding the seniority of one of the appellants It was further made clear in the said direction that it has to be decided after taking into account the decision of the Principal Bench of the <ORG> in <NAME> case in A No SCC The relevant appointments were purely temporary and on ad hoc basis and were for a limited duration and it was also made clear that services on ad hoc basis will not confer any claim in the matter of seniority confirmation etc The <ORG> is of the view that ad hoc service to count for seniority must be rendered continuously till the date of regularisation for years or more and therefore it held that the appellants could not take advantage of the ad hoc promotions made purely as a stop gap arrangement and it is only in special circumstances such ad hoc service could be counted for purpose of seniority as noticed in some of the decisions of this <ORG> Consequently the application filed by the contesting respondents was allowed and it was declared that the appellants were not entitled to count their ad hoc service in the post of Executive Engineers Electrical for seniority confirmation promotion etc The <ORG> rejected the contention raised by the <ORG> that he is deemed to be on regular basis only with effect from May when the <ORG> met Since the seniority list dated January was only provisional the <ORG> directed appellant No to make another representation to the <ORG> which the <ORG> was directed to dispose of in accordance with law Pursuant to this direction given by the Madras Bench of the <ORG> it is stated that the seniority had to be re fixed and therefore it is contended that inasmuch as they had rendered service for a long period at any rate in higher cadre and their promotions having been subsequently regularised ought to be treated as giving them seniority in the matter The <ORG> has taken note of the fact that the ad hoc promotions given to the appellants were not de hors the rules It was contended that there were four vacancies against Assistant Engineers quota but <ORG> had informed the <ORG> to fill two vacancies from direct recruitment and the <ORG> accordingly selected <NAME> and <NAME> though <NAME> and the first appellant were also eligible and vacancies were existing they were not regularly promoted by wrong interpretation of rules and separately reserving two vacancies for promotee cadre There was considerable delay in the introduction of initial constitution clause and the same was published only in after a gap of years and came into force with effect from April <ORG> was thereafter convened by the <ORG> on August and appellants and officers including <NAME> and several other officers were promoted on the dates indicating against their names Appellant No and <NAME> were not included as initial constituents since they neither completed eight years of service nor on ad hoc before April <ORG> has also filed two appeals one Civil Appeal No of arising out of judgment dated June in A No passed by the Madras Bench of <ORG> and other Civil Appeal No of against judgment and order dated November passed by the <ORG> in A No There is another dimension to the case by reason of the introduction of the Rules called The Posts Telegraphs Civil Engineering Electrical Gazetted Officers Recruitment Amendment Rules which were given retrospective effect from April Prior to commencement of the said Rules there were officers who had joined directly as Assistant Executive Engineer Electrical through the Combined Engineering Services Examination held by <ORG> In order to ensure that these officers are not deprived of the service rendered by them before commencement of the rules it was proposed to incorporate retrospectively a provision for initial constitution of these posts Therefore though the rules were amended by a notification issued on April published in <ORG> and it was given retrospective effect but the purpose of giving retrospective effect to the provision relating to the initial constitution of these posts would not prejudicially affect the interests of any person already in service Reliance has been placed on the decision of this Court in <ORG> supra That is a case where the quota rule between the direct recruits and the promotees had broken down and the appointments were made from one source in excess of the quota but were made after following the procedure prescribed by the rules for the appointment therefore it was held that the appointees should not be pushed down below the appointees from the other source inducted in the service at a later date The development work of the <ORG> pre emptorily required experienced and efficient hands and in that situation the <ORG> Government took a decision to fill up the vacancies by promotion in excess of the quota but only after subjecting the officers to the test prescribed by the rules It is difficult to appreciate as to how the principle stated in that case could be extended to the case of st appellant in the present case as the quota rule had not broken down in any manner nor is there any material before the court to show that he has not been duly considered by <ORG> before appointment to the higher grade If the ad hoc appointment has been made as the stop gap arrangement and where there was a procedural irregularity in making appointments according to rules and that irregularity was subsequently rectified the principle to be applied in that case was stated once again There is difficulty in the way of the appellants to fight out their case for seniority should be reckoned by reason of the length of the service whether ad hoc or otherwise inasmuch as they had not been recruited regularly SCC but all these decisions do not point out that in case the promotions had been made ad hoc and they are subsequently regularised in the service in all the cases ad hoc service should be reckoned for the purpose of seniority It is only in those cases where initially they had been recruited even though they have been appointed ad hoc the recruitment was subject to the same process as it had been done in the case of regular appointment and that the same was not a stop gap arrangement However we make it clear as noticed earlier that while amending the rules of recruitment in the all those who are already in service will be borne in mind in adjusting the seniority amongst the promotees inter se and suitable adjustments could be made and so far as the direct recruits are concerned their cases will go by their quota rule and the view taken by the <ORG> in this regard cannot be taken exception of
