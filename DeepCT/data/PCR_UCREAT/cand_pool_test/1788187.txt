<ORG> was given right to print any additional directory and also to sell the same to any other person including any government department Clause of Annexure A to the original agreement also provided that without prejudice to the rights and remedies of the <ORG> against any of the provisions of the contract or otherwise in law if <ORG> committed any default or breach of the terms and conditions of the contract and or failed in the due performance thereof within the time fixed by the contract which was the essence of the contract and did not complete the entire work on the stipulated due date the <ORG> shall be entitled to recover from the <ORG> to which the <ORG> agreed to be bound to pay to the <ORG> as and by way of compensation or liquidated damages an amount calculated at the rate of Rs for every day or part thereof of the delay beyond the stipulated date in respect of the item which was not completed or finished and delivered completely to the <ORG> on the stipulated date as mentioned in the contract This clause imposed further stringent conditions on ii If the contractor being a company shall pass a resolution or the Court shall make an order that the company shall be wound up or if a receiver or a manager on behalf of a creditor shall be appointed or if circumstances shall arise which entitle the court or creditor to appoint a receiver or a manager or which entitle the court to make a winding up order When the Contractor has made himself liable for action under any of aforesaid cases in any case in which under any conditions of this contract the Contractor shall have rendered himself to forfeiture of their security deposit or in cases of abandonment of work or in case of any other breach of contract by the contractor for any cause whatsoever the <ORG> shall have powers to adopt any or all of the following courses as the <ORG> may deem best suited to their own requirements A The to rescind the contract of which rescission notice in writing to the Contractor under the hand of the General Manager or of <ORG> shall be conclusive evidence and in that case the security deposit of the Contractor shall stand forfeited and be absolutely at the disposal of the <ORG> To employ any other contractor or labour to supply materials to carry out the work or any part of the works debiting the Contractor with all costs including cost of the labour and the price of the materials It says that since then two issues of the Delhi and one issue of Bombay telephone directory with yellow pages had been published but the subsequent issue of Bombay directory which was to come in October November had not come out yet and that it was understood that they <ORG> have run into financial difficulties and cash flow problem Perhaps it was on account of some letter of <ORG> sent to <ORG> in January Then the note records that <ORG> had approached the <ORG> with a request that <ORG> should advance unsecured loan to them for purchase of paper from the paper mills and also for payment of printing charges to the printing presses As per agreement there is no provision to give unsecured loan <ORG> for specific purpose of printing and polishing the telephone directories for Delhi and Bombay That will require the <ORG> to refund the advance collections already made Again in the note case is made out for grant of loan fRs crores though note for the th Meeting sought approval for the loan of Rs crores for <ORG> The <ORG> also stated that it should be ensured that copies of the directories were made available by June and that the <ORG> might consider rescinding the contract as soon as the second issue of Bombay directory and third issue of Delhi directory were published Minutes of this meeting show that it was brought to the notice of the Board that considering the past dealings with <ORG> and their present management it would not be feasible for <ORG> to extend a long term loan of Rs crores Then the Board said that in order to enable the <ORG> to salvage the contract and get the job executed without further delay and avoid consequent inconvenience to the customers it agreed to the second option in principle but suggested that Chairman <ORG> might set up a Negotiation Committee consisting of senior <ORG> officers to negotiate revised terms of agreement with <ORG> Sterling Computers Regarding their request for loan it may be made clear to them that <ORG> would not grant any loan whatsoever as the new partner associate is expected to raise the liquidity to the extent required for delivering the directories to <ORG> within the stipulated time schedule Regarding their request for force majeure clause it may be made clear to them that price escalation on paper cannot be allowed Again it is stated that all the terms and conditions arid stipulations contained in the original agreement and the memorandum of understanding this refers to the terms agreed upon in <ORG> would be the integral part of the supplemental agreement and all obligations of <ORG> and rights and privileges and powers provided for <ORG> there under and under the law shall be applicable and available to and binding on the parties to the supplemental agreement as if the same were the part of the supplemental agreement The supplemental agreement then refers to the opening of letters of credit and that payment regarding escalation in the price of paper shall not be borne by the <ORG> nor <ORG> would pay any compensation whatsoever in that regard to <ORG> and or the <ORG> shall not allow their business to be wound up nor shall allow any receiver to be appointed and shall not allow any restraint constraint order of attachment order to be passed in respect of any part of the said unexecuted job or their assets as a result whereof <ORG> may suffer and may not obtain the said copies of telephone directories and supplemental from the <ORG> Neither the parties of the First Part nor the <ORG> shall cease to carry on its their business till the said printing job is fully completed with such number of directories as shall be specified by <ORG> to <ORG> and or the <ORG> and all their obligations hereunder are fully satisfied and shall apprise <ORG> of all developments from time to time which may have a bearing on the successful implementation of the understanding agreement reached between the parties as recorded in this Agreement to be read with the said Memorandum of Understanding There is also provision for printing and publishing of supplementary directories at the cost of <ORG> and or <ORG> He said the principle behind the award of the original contract which was awarded to <ORG> for the year to was for the purposes of earn and pay Commenting on the stand of the petitioner that supplemental agreement was a complete sell out and smacked of favoritism shown by <ORG> to <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> and that the performance guarantee of Rs crore was not invoked and penalty at the rate of Rs lakh per day for the delay was not levied and that before entering into the supplemental agreement open tenders were not invited and lastly offer made by the petitioner in its letters dated Ii July and July not properly considered the Attorney General said that the decision taken in the matter was a commercial decision considered as a viable method to salvage Rs crores and odd and considering also the consequences of cancelling the original agreement the delay in resolving the disputes through arbitration and prospects of the court granting any injunction against the <ORG> consequent delay in inviting fresh tenders and <ORG> having already collected over Rs crores as advance for publication of advertisements in the telephone directories were the considerations which weighed in the mind of the <ORG> and particularly keeping in view the delay which was being caused in expeditious printing of the directories Mr <NAME> also said that offer of the petitioner in its letters dated July and July was not serious and even now its offer to execute the supplemental contract by payingRs croreswasmerely a kiteflying He said the <ORG> of <ORG> took into consideration all the relevant circumstances and then resolved to enter into the supplemental agreement He then said that bringing out of the directory by the <ORG> for Bombay in March and Delhi in May June justified the decision of the <ORG> and it could not therefore be said that it was so arbitrary as to shock the conscience of the court He also commented on the delay on the part of the petitioner in filing the writ petition and said laches on the part of the petitioner made the petition not maintainable He said <ORG> went to <ORG> in for grant of loan and when they collected a revenue ofRs crores for publication of the advertisements Mr <NAME> said that failing to invite tenders before entering into supplemental agreement was violative of Article of the Constitution and he queried could departure from normal rule be justified on the basis of commercial considerations He said in the facts and circumstances of the case the action on the part of the <ORG> was malafide and was actuated by a desire to render pecuniary benefits to <ORG> and <ORG> at the cost of public revenue He said the petition could not be dismissed on the ground of laches when there were none and also it were the respondents who were to blame As the original agreement having lapsed by efflux of time and also expired as per period prescribed in the contract there was no question of extending the same and the case of the petitioner was that this was a new contract altogether though in the garb of supplemental agreement <ORG> an independent party was introduced by back door method The tender of the petitioner was in fact for a lesser amount than that of <ORG> but <ORG> which was constituted recommended that contract be given to the petitioner for Rs crores which amount was higher than what <ORG> had offered Since the <ORG> was not awarded the contract it filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the action of the <ORG>s in awarding the contract to the petitioner At the same time <ORG> had also addressed a letter to the Assistant General Manager Directory <ORG> Bombay stating asunder TENDERS for printing and supply of Main Telephone Directories with Yellow Pages on Turnkey Basis are under finalisation In this there is a letter addressed by the Chief General Manager <ORG> to the customers It is also not clear as to in what circumstances <ORG> just came in the picture except that there is a letter of <ORG> dated August wherein it wanted the reassignment of the original contract for Delhi and Bombay to <ORG> claiming this company to be its subsidiary and further that <ORG> would enter into a management and financial agreement with <ORG> Computers Ltd <ORG> in this letter to <ORG> said that contract of <ORG> with <ORG> would continue and it will provide financial assistance on terms and conditions mutually agreed to and further that it would provide bank guarantee in the sum of Rs crores in favor of <ORG> and <ORG> would give an equivalent amount against the bank guarantee as advance to <ORG> When there was a blatant breach of the original agreement we have not been able to find even a lame excuse on behalf of the <ORG> as to why at least performance guarantee was not invoked and further why penalty was not levied During the period of the original contract <ORG> had all through been collecting revenue towards advertisements both for yellow and white pages from the public and no attempt appears to have been made by <ORG> requiring them to stop collecting advertisements when there was flagrant breach of contract by <ORG> Its contention that if it had gone to court it would have got involved in long litigation and dead lock might have been created is an argument in desperation to justify its action in entering into the supplemental agreement on any ground when that action is certainly indefensible Who is going to supply tree copies unless he has opportunity to reap benefits much more than that <ORG> failed to note the revenue already collected for yellow and white pages There are separate charges for strip entry and logo to be published as advertisements in the directories There is nothing on record that the rates were fixed by <ORG> according to analysis of market and cost factors and when <ORG> was advised accordingly as per the supplemental agreement We have seen the minutes of the Board meeting the agenda note and the letters written by <ORG> and <ORG> and there is no whisper of any employees having been taken over by <ORG> or any attempt by any of the parties to protect their employment The way the rates of advertisements have been enhanced by <ORG> and there being no check on it by <ORG> and the fact that a right which was monopolistic was given to <ORG> to charge any amount for advertisements in the telephone directories speaks of the volume of misconduct of the <ORG> The very fact that <ORG> took no action under the original agreement and allowed it to lapse without even getting a penny out of over Rs crores of royalty promised to it and not enforcing the bank guarantee or levying penalty for breach of original contract would by itself show that it never acted in the interest of the public or in public interest In this case action of the <ORG> in disposing of certain property of the debtor by sale was set aside and mandamus was issued to the <ORG> to resume possession of the property and act in accordance with the directions given in the judgment There is a distinction between prying into details of day to day administration and of the legitimate actions or resultant consequences thereof Keeping these observations in view the action of the <ORG> in entering into supplemental agreement with <ORG> and <ORG> cannot stand it being illegal and against the provisions of the Constitution After the arguments in the writ petition were heard we required the <ORG> to file in scaled cover the relevant File of the department including the file containing letter dated January sent by the Directory Officer of <ORG> New Delhi to <ORG> The supplemental agreement gave more benefits to <ORG> and <ORG> than those agreed to in the original contract and it cannot therefore be said that it was extension of the original contract There was absolutely no justification for the <ORG> not to enforce the terms of the original agreement In this background if we examine the relevant facts the offer of the petitioner to pay royalty amount of Rs crores for publication of directories as per the supplemental agreement is not illusory and certainly not kite flying as the learned Attorney General would like us to think But then that would also be perpetuating an illegality While we set aside the supplemental agreement we will however direct that <ORG> will retain all the moneys collected by it from the advertisers and <ORG> and <ORG> shall also pay to the <ORG> all the revenue collected by them after the last issue of Bombay and Delhi directories from the advertisers within one month with complete accounts Petitioner will be entitled to costs
