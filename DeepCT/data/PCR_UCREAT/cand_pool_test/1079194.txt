under section read with section and section read with section of the Indian Penal Code The appellants appealed to this court against the decision of <ORG> Allowing the appeal the <ORG> HELD The High <ORG> on an appraisal of the evidence came to the conclusion that the prosecution had proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt It referred to a number of decisions of this <ORG> in considering the scope of its jurisdiction in interfering with an order of acquittal passed by the trial court but while applying the principles it failed to appreciate that the view taken by the trial court was reasonable and plausible While considering an appeal against acquittal <ORG> must in appreciating the evidence keep in mind that if on appraisal of evidence and considering relevant attending circumstances it is found that two views are possible one held by the trial court for acquitting the accused and the other for convicting the accused in such a situation the rule of prudence should guide <ORG> not to disturb the order of acquittal made by the trial court showed that the occurrence took place at hours while the report was lodged at hours There were material contradictions in the testimony of <NAME> <NAME> the investigating officer This view finds support from the testimony of <NAME> PW and other circumstances There were material contradictions in the statements of the three witnesses <NAME> PW <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> PW and in view of the same and further in view of the discrepancy regarding the delay in the lodging of the first information report it was apparent that till the first information report was lodged nobody knew who the assailants were and that was why <NAME> could not disclose the names of the assailants to <NAME> on his arrival at the scene of occurrence after he had been sent to bring the bus tickets Moreover it was the admitted case of the prosecution that there was an exchange of fire from both sides by the assailants and by <NAME> and <NAME> but no other cartridges were recovered by the Investigating officer It came into evidence that large number of persons had gathered at the scene of occurrence but no employee of the toll barrier or <ORG> once or local resident came forward to support the prosecution case The trial court rightly discarded their testimony as their statements had been recorded by the police after two months of the occurrence In the opinion of the doctor the person who caused injuries to the deceased was at a higher level than the deceased this was wholly inconsistent with the testimony of the eye witnesses The prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and <ORG> committed error in interfering with the trial court order of acquittal Order of <ORG> and the appellant conviction were set aside and order of the trial court was restored and the appellants were acquitted The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dated setting aside the trial court order acquitting the appellants herein and convicting them for offence under Section read with Section of the Indian Panel Code and sentencing each of them to undergo imprisonment for life The prosecution case in brief is that on <NAME> deceased resident of village Kharoni Ajaigarh District Panna had gone to <ORG> Panna to file reply to a show cause notice issued to him for the cancellation of his gun licence After completion of investigation a charge sheet was submitted against five accused persons including the two appellants <NAME> and <NAME> for trial for offences under Section read with Section and under Section read with Section of the Indian Panel Code On appeal by the <ORG> Government <ORG> disagreed with the reasons recorded by the trial court and placing reliance on the testimony of the eye witnesses i <NAME> and <NAME> it allowed the <ORG> appeal and set aside the acquittal of the appellants and convicted them under Section read with Section of the Indian Penal Code and awarded sentence of imprisonment for life to each of them The trial court held that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and no reliance could be placed on the testimony of <NAME> PW and <NAME> The trial court referred to a number of circumstances creating doubt on the credibility of the prosecution story but <ORG> differed from those findings and on appraisal of evidence it came to the conclusion that the prosecution had proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt <ORG> referred to a number of decisions of this court in considering the scope of its jurisdiction in interfering with an order of acquittal passed by the trial court but while applying the principles it failed to appreciate that the view taken by the trial court was reasonable and plausible In other words if the main grounds on which the court below based its order acquitting the accused are reasonable and plausible and cannot be entirely and effectively dislodged or demolished <ORG> should not disturb the acquittal If on appraisal of the evidence and on considering relevant attending circumstances it is found that two views are possible one as held by the trial court for acquitting the accused and the other for convicting the accused in such a situation the rule of prudence should guide <ORG> not to disturb the order of acquittal made by the trial court <ORG> made an attempt to explain the circumstances in holding that some times the memory of the witnesses fail and a broad view of the evidence given by the eye witnesses clearly indicated that the prosecution had proved its case We have been taken through the entire evidence and we have also closely and carefully considered the judgment of the trial court and <ORG> shows that the occurrence took place on hours while the report was lodged at hours that is to say within minutes of the occurrence He further stated that the report had been written by the <ORG> clerk on his dictation and that the police arrived at the scene of occurrence after an hour of his lodging the first information report He further stated that <NAME> was recorded by him after the dead body of the deceased had been sent by him for post mortem examination which according to the document Ex There are material contradictions in the testimony of <NAME> PW This view finds support from testimony of <NAME> and other circumstances He had further told <NAME> that he was apprehending danger from the accused persons so he would get into bus at the Toll barrier The prosecution further alleged that after the occurrence took place <NAME> dead body was lying near Takhat at the Octroi barrier when <NAME> arrived at the scene At a later stage in cross examination he said that <NAME> had asked <NAME> PW who had killed <NAME> but <NAME> told him that he would tell him later while going to the police station for lodging the first information report According to <NAME> PW when <NAME> reached the spot he directed him to proceed to the Collectorate and give information to the police about the murder having taken place <NAME> proceeded to the Collectorate and from there he contacted the Kotwali on telephone and gave information about the murder having taken place near the Toll barrier <NAME> PW has stated that neither <NAME> asked nor he told him the names of the assailants Admittedly <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and the deceased were friends of each other and <NAME> had been sent by the deceased to bring bus tickets and he had also told him about apprehensions to his life and according to the <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW when <NAME> arrived at the scene he did not enquire about the names of the assailants although dead body of the deceased was lying at the spot Moreover it is the admitted case of the prosecution that there was exchange of fire from both sides by the assailants as well as by <NAME> and <NAME> but no other cartridges were recovered by the investigating officer It has further come into evidence that large number of persons had gathered at the scene of occurrence but surprisingly enough no employee of Toll Barrier <ORG> or local resident came forward to support the prosecution case The prosecution produced <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW who deposed that they had seen the appellants running away with weapons and that they had recognised them <ORG> rightly discarded their testimony as their statement had been recorded by the police after two months of the occurrence without there being any explanation for the delay There was a fracture of lateral side of left th ribe There was fracture of th and th We do not think it necessary to discuss it in detail as the trial court has discussed this question at length and we agree with those findings In the opinion of the doctor the person who caused injuries to the deceased was at higher level than the deceased this is wholly inconsistent with the testimony of eyewitnesses <NAME> In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances we are satisfied that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and <ORG> committed error in interfering with the trial court order of acquittal We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order of <ORG> and the appellants conviction and restore the order of the trial court and acquit the appellants
