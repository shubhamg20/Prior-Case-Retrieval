The plaintiff sues for a declaration that he is solely entitled to the management of Pichai <NAME> in the Amirtagateswaraswami temple at Thirukkadaiyur and to the possession of the lands attached to the said <NAME> in the alternative he claims that he should be given joint possession and management with the defendant Incidentally he contends that the female members of the family of <NAME> have no right The previous suits and the course of events suggest that as a matter of convenience <ORG> was permitted to manage the <NAME> without prejudice to the rights of the other members of the family The plea of <NAME> in this suit was that the senior branch from whose members <NAME> had obtained the transfer had been totally excluded for over the statutory period and that therefore the plaintiff had no subsisting right which he could enforce His son <NAME> succeeded him and died in Now we shall deal with the contentions put forward on either side It stands to reason that such management should be regarded as being held on behalf of all the members and not adversely to them Therefore we must hold that <ORG> had not become the sole manager and that he had no right to will away that right in favour of <ORG> This fact is alleged in the plaint of the Pandara Sannadhi Ex We must therefore negative the contention that <NAME> had acquired a prescriptive right against the other members of his family We must now deal with contention of Mr <NAME> for the respondent As pointed out by the Subordinate Judge during the lifetime of <NAME> and <NAME> there were senior members who did not assert their rights to sole management as against the active trustee However much one may wish that such a rule of law should obtain in regard to the management of trusts we are of opinion that the course of decisions in this Presidency which has the sanction of <ORG> is opposed to this principle Sir <NAME> pointed out that the right of trusteeship in a public institution possessed by the members of a family when hereditary descends in the same manner as the right to the enjoyment of ordinary family property it is pointed out that it was a public trust and that the right of management has devolved upon all the members of the family Even otherwise we fail to see except when it is established by cogent evidence that there is custom to that effect how the widows and daughters of a divided member can be excluded from the management of charity property A fortiori in the case of a secular office like the present there is absolutely no justification for the contention that they are not entitled to manage The evidence as to usage has been fully discussed by the Subordinate Judge and we agree with his conclusion that it has not been shown that females are not entitled to manage this Kattalai In the circumstances of the case each party must bear his own costs
