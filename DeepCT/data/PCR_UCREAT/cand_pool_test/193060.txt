The only question requiring authoritative determination is whether the amendment made in Rule of Order of the Code of Civil Procedure by <ORG> is still operative in the Courts of the District Judges and Subordinate Judges of st Class in the Union Territory of Delhi The submission eloquently pressed by <NAME> on behalf of the defendant petitioner is that under section of <ORG> Act No of <ORG> alone has the power to make rules and orders with respect to practice and procedure and all rules made by <ORG> with respect to such practice and procedure in relation to the subordinate Courts at Delhi must cease to have effect as soon as <ORG> ceased to have jurisdiction over such subordinate Courts The question arising for decision in the reported case was whether the rules made by <ORG> at Nagpur in exercise of the powers conferred under section Civil and which were in force in the former State of Madhya Pradesh as it existed before the Reorganisation of States on were enforceable in that territory of the new Madhya Pradesh which up to was called the Part State of Madhya Bharat Section of the States Reorganisation Act falling in Part of that Act was held nto to apply to the Rules made under section Civil because that section referred to only those laws rules and orders which dealt with the practice and procedure in <ORG> and nto those which deal with practice and procedure in all Courts A rule made by <ORG> under section Civil was according to the reported decision a piece of delegated or subordinate legislation and was governed by section and nto by section of the States Reorganisation Act I may here reproduce the following observations from the reported judgment It is obvious enough that any of the rules in the first schedule of the Code could be annulled altered or added to by such rules as <ORG> made under that power Rules made in exercise of that power became a part and parcel of the First Schedule of the Civil Procedure Code so far as that State was concerned According to the amendment as it stood at the time of the partition of the country Order was applicable to the Courts of the District Judges and Subordinate Judges of the First Class of Delhi Province and the Courts of the District Judges and Subordinate Judges of First Class in the civil Districts of Lahore and Amritsar in the Province of Punjab Later <ORG> took action under section of the Code of Civil Procedure and amended among other rules contained in the First Schedule of the Code Rule of Order Indeed the validity of the amendment has nto been challenged on the ground of want of power in <ORG> or on any other ground Turning now to the scheme of Part of the Code dealing with the Rules section lays down that the rules in the First Schedule shall have effect as if enacted in the body of the Code of Civil Procedure until annulled or altered in accordance with the provisions of that Part Section lays down that the rules made and approved as provided in sections to shall be published in <ORG> and from the date of publication or from such other date as may be specified have the same force and effect within the local limits of the jurisdiction of <ORG> which made them as if they had been contained in the First Schedule The ratio of the decision in Dr <NAME> case Air Lah fully applies to the case in hand and the validity of Rule of Order as amended by <ORG> has rightly been nto assailed It is undoubtedly true that of the Code lays down that the rules made approved and published have the same force and effect within the local limits of the jurisdiction of <ORG> which made them Section also empowers <ORG>s mentioned therein to make rules regulating their own procedure and the procedure of the civil <ORG> subject to their superintendence The question requiring determination in the present case is that when Rule of Order has been validly amended by <ORG> so as to apply the summary procedure on negotiable instruments to the Courts of the District Judges and Subordinate Judges of the First Class of the Union Territory of Delhi can this amendment be held automatically nullified merely because a separate <ORG> has been set up for such Union Territory In other words do sections and of the Code have this effect Nothing has been said at the bar in support of this proposition
