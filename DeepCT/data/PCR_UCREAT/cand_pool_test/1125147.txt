In <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> A I have expressed a doubt whether in the case of an ordinary mortgage in the mofussal the mortgagee can exercise a power of sale given by the instrument of mortgage The deed of mortgage between the parties contains a power of sale to be exercised after a previous notice to the mortgagor Such a notice was given to the plaintiff on the st February and thereupon on the th March the plaintiff filed this suit to redeem and obtained an injunction restraining the defendant from exercising the power of sale The owner of the equity of redemption can only stay the sale pendente lite by paying the amount due into <ORG> or by giving prima facie evidence that the power of sale is being exercised in a fraudulent or improper manner contrary to the terms of the mortgage In the present case the plaintiff alleges that the mortgage debt has been fully satisfied and if he could satisfy the <ORG> that there are good prima facie reasons for supposing that to be the case the <ORG> might properly restrain the sale The plaintiff allegation of full satisfaction of the debt appears inconsistent with the attempt which he makes to show that in and he tendered sums amounting to more than Us If tenders were made and improperly refused by the defendant the plaintiff might have brought his suit to compel the defendant to receive the money due to him and to reconvey the property The plaintiff will of course be at liberty to apply again for such an injunction if he can make out a prima facie case showing that the debt has been fully satisfied or if he pay into <ORG> a sum which is prima facie sufficient to discharge the debt I would reverse the order of <ORG> enjoining the defendant <NAME> to refrain from exercising the power of sale given to him under his instrument of mortgage pending the disposal of the suit brought by the mortgagor <NAME> for the redemption of the property as I consider that the injunction has been granted on insufficient grounds and without any evidence being adduced sufficient to warrant the exercise of this extraordinary power of the <ORG> No witness was examined nor was any affidavit filed in support of the application for an injunction and the only verified document on the record is the plaint When a mortgagee has in pursuance of a power of sale given to him under his instrument of mortgage served the mortgagor with notice of his intention to exercise this power the mortgagor is not entitled to file a suit for redemption and then ask the <ORG> for an injunction restraining the mortgagee from exercising his power of sale unless fraud is charged against the mortgagee To grant such an injunction would be to cancel one of the clauses of the deed to which both the parties had agreed and to annul one of the chief securities on which persons advancing money on mortgage rely The mortgagor is entitled to have the sale of the property suspended only if he can show either that he has paid off the mortgage lien or that he has made a legal tender of the amount due which has been refused In the case before us there is not even prima facie ground shown at present for considering that the mortgage lien has been paid off There is no distinct allegation that this money was ever tendered to the mortgagee by the <ORG> or by any one else and refused The plaintiff pleader wishes us to infer that such a tender was made but in the absence of evidence we can draw no such inference and as there is no reason shown why the <ORG> should have undertaken the duty of paying off the mortgage if we are to infer anything I should incline rather to the inference that the money was deposited with the <ORG> not that he might tender it to the mortgagee but to secure the <ORG> from the consequences of his act in letting the mortgagor cancel the power of attorney under which the mortgagee had up to that time been dealing with the produce of the salt pans and letting the mortgagor back into enjoyment of the salt pans
