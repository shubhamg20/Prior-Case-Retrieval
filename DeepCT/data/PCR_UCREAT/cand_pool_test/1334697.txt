That appeal came up for hearing as stated above before <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The learned Judges came to the conclusion that <ORG> had become aware of the said Scheme No for constructing a road which was to run partly through the area belonging to the <ORG> and it seems to me that that is the most equitable way of valuing the land acquired It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the valuation was increased by that witness during his cross examination to one lakh odd The appeal is accordingly allowed in part the award of the Collector and the <ORG> is varied and the <ORG> is allowed Rs The Secretary of <ORG> thereafter applied for and obtained leave to appeal to <NAME> in Council against the judgment and decree of <NAME> and <NAME> Leave was granted on nd July Their Lordships held that the appeals were incompetent and they accordingly dismissed the same on the ground that the statute did not provide for an appeal to His Majesty in Council having regard to the circumstances disclosed on the record It is stated on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> that the fact of the dismissal of the said appeals by their Lordships became known in Calcutta about the end of April or at any rate in the first week of May There is some dispute about this as is evidenced by an affidavit made by Mr <NAME> an Advocate of this Court but for the purposes of this Rule we shall proceed on the footing that the Secretary of <ORG> became apprised of the fact of the dismissal of the said appeals in the first week of May and pay no attention to Mr <NAME> affidavit which ought not to have been made It is now alleged on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> in the present claim that in taking the figure Rs The present application is strenuously resisted on behalf of <ORG> on the ground that the application itself is hopelessly barred by limitation It is further submitted on behalf of <ORG> that the period between nd April and th March cannot be excused under the provisions of Section Limitation Act In they came to know that <ORG> intende to run a feet east to west road through their land and they prepared a lay out incorporating this road and leaving a vacant strip of feet for a roadway The Collector held that this was land over which the owners of plots adjacent to it had rights of way and that it was not building land and he awarded compensation on that basis We are of opinion that on the merits there is a great deal to be said on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> and that it does appear that the learned Judge fell into an error in arriving at the figure Rs This is a position so extraordinary and so strange that we feel some difficulty in believing that the Secretary of <ORG> could have been so advised by any responsible lawyer It is also claimed on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> that he had good grounds for believing that an appeal lay to <NAME> in Council and that at no time prior to th March did he become aware of the fact that an appeal to <NAME> in Council was incompetent and that under the law there could be no such appeal It is also claimed on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> that there has not been any undue delay between th March and th June Indeed it is not disputed and it cannot be disputed that the Secretary of <ORG> was aware of the error referred to above immediately the judgment of this Court was pronounced We can find nothing in the circumstances disclosed which can induce us to excuse the period between the date when the judgment was pronounced and the date when leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council was applied for I agree with the learned Chief Justice in the conclusion he has arrived at in this case This ground was also taken in other forms in grounds and which are to the following effect It appears to me that the scheme of the order relating to review in the Civil Procedure Code is that in those cases in which an appeal lies the application for review should be filed before the appeal is lodged It had been held in some cases that when an appeal has been preferred before the application for review and the appeal had been dismissed no application can be made for review of the decree but it has been contended on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> that these cases are distinguishable from the present as in the present case there is no decision by their Lordships of <ORG> on the merits of the appeal and the effect of their Lordships order is to declare that they had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal There is some substance in this contention of the Secretary of <ORG> but it is not necessary to express any final opinion in the view which we have taken on the question of limitation Regarding the merits of the review application I had some doubt in the course of argument as to whether the ground of review was not the misapplication of the evidence of <NAME> and the <ORG> valuer by the learned Judges and if that was so there was no ground for review within the meaning of Order of the Code but on further consideration I was of opinion that it is possible to regard the ground having regard to the findings of the learned Judges read with the evidence of <NAME> and the <ORG> valuer as an error apparent on the face of the record The Secretary of <ORG> might have pursued both the remedies simultaneously and in the ordinary course of human events one would have expected that application should have been made a day before the time limited by law on half the court fee to the learned Judges who decided the appeal who might have yet matters right if they were convinced of the apparent error on the face of the record and this period has to be taken into account for considering whether sufficient cause has not been made out for extending the period of limitation In these circumstances this cannot be treated as an arithmetical error as to be capable of being corrected under Section Civil If we had been of opinion that the application of the Secretary of <ORG> was not barred by limitation it is doubtful if we might not have to rehear the appeal instead of rectifying the judgment and decree in this proceeding for review
