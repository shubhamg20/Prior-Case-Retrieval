Section occurs in Chapter IV which carries the heading Goods of special importance in Inter State Trade or Commerce Section imposes certain restrictions upon and conditions in regard to the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of declared goods by <ORG> They are a the tax on declared goods shall not exceed per cent and the tax shall not be levied at more than one stage where a tax has been levied on an intra state sale and such goods are later sold in the course of inter State trade or commerce the tax levied on intraState sale shall be reimbursed to the person effecting the inter State sale if a tax has been levied on the sale or purchase of paddy and the rice derived from such paddy is sold later the tax on sale of rice shall be reduced by the amount of tax paid on paddy and the pulses referred to in clause vi a of Section shall mean and include pulses whole or separated and pulses with or without husk Under the scheme of our Constitution the power to levy tax on the sale of goods is vested in the States by Entry in List of the Seventh Schedule but this power is subject to the limitations contained in Article However so far as the declared goods are concerned the absolute prohibition has given way to restrictions and conditions as may be imposed by <ORG> by law Clause of Article which is immediately relevant for our purpose read and reads as follows before and after the Sixth Amendment Act Before the Sixth Amendment Act No law made by the <ORG> of a State imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by <ORG> by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it is been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent As contemplated by the unamended clause of Article the <ORG> had enacted the Essential Goods Declaration and Regulation of Tax on Sale or Purchase Act declaring certain goods as essential for the life of the community It came into force on August The Act came into force on and with effect from September Section as originally enacted did not contain any clause relating to cereals or for that matter relating to pulses Every sales tax law of a State shall insofar as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods be subject to the following restrictions and conditions namely a the tax payable under that law in respect of any sale or purchase of such goods inside the State shall not exceed four per cent of the sale or purchase price thereof and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage where a tax has been levied under that law in respect of the sale or purchase inside the State of any declared goods and such goods are sold in the course of inter State trade or commerce and tax has been paid under this Act in respect of the sale of such goods in the course of inter State trade or commerce the tax levied under such law shall be reimbursed to the person making such sale in the course of inter State trade or commerce in such manner and subject to such conditions as may be provided in any law in force in that State Any interpretation placed upon the said expression wheat should be consistent with and should be designed to further the object underlying the provision Sections and of the Act read with clause of Article of the Constitution constitute restrictions upon the plenary power of the State Legislatures to levy tax upon the sale of goods In such a situation there is no room for reading other commodities than those specifically mentioned into it Entry of List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution vests in the State <ORG>s the power to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers subject to the provisions of Entry A of List I Entry A of List introduced by the Sixth Amendment empowers the <ORG> to levy tax on inter State sales purchases of goods other than newspapers whereas Entry in List I relates to taxes on the sale or purchases of newspapers and on advertisements published therein Article as already stated contains certain prohibitions and restrictions upon the power of the State <ORG>s to levy tax on the sale of goods We shall refer to these decisions at some detail a little while later Indeed in one of the decisions this <ORG> has by way of illustration explained that wheat is different from wheat STC AIR SC SCR SCC SCC Tax We do not wish to nor is it necessary to consider and examine the issue in terms of federalism or the need to maintain a balance between the powers of the federal government and the States as has been done in certain decisions of the Supreme <ORG> rendered with reference to the commerce clause It has the following properties it must not be contrary to the principal clause it must neither increase nor diminish it but where the principal clause is general in terms it may restrict it see this explained with many examples <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ER We may at this stage refer to the decisions mentioned hereinabove at some detail a Constitution Bench of this Court pointed out the approach to be adopted by the courts in matters where the legislative power of the State is trenched upon by <ORG> Entry of List speaks of industries but it is made subject to the provisions of Entries and of List Entry of List I reads Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest <ORG> can be denied legislative power under Entry to the extent <ORG> makes declaration under Entry and by such declaration <ORG> acquires power to legislate only in respect of those industries in respect of which declaration is made and to the extent as manifested by legislation incorporating the declaration and no more The said clause refers to certain primary commodities the goods produced or manufactured out of them cannot be included in those commodities paras There is no merit in the submission made on behalf of the assessees that they had not consumed paddy when they produced rice from it by merely carrying out the process of dehusking at their mills We have to understand the word consumes in Section i of the Act in this economic sense The question arising for consideration before <ORG> was posed by the Bench in the following terms SCC para The question therefore before us is whether rice which obtained from paddy already taxed under Item of the Second Schedule ceases to be rice falling prima facie under Item as rice on which a tax was already paid when it was in the form of paddy Does heating or parching only to make it edible have that effect It was answered in the following words SCC para It is clear that there is a distinction between paddy as found in Item of the Second Schedule and rice as mentioned under Item of the First Schedule But there are no separate entries for rice and rice reduced into an edible form by heating or parching without any addition of ingredients or appreciable changes in chemical composition In our opinion the principle of the said decision has no application in the context and scheme of Sections and Rule provided for deduction of the tax paid by a manufacturer on purchase of groundnut and or kernel from out of the tax paid by him on the sale of oil derived therefrom Any dealer who manufactures groundnut oil and cake from groundnut and or kernel purchased by him may on application to the assessing authority having jurisdiction over the area in which he carries on his business be registered as a manufacturer of groundnut oil and cake Every such registered manufacturer of groundnut oil will be entitled to a deduction under clause of sub rule of Rule equal to the value of the groundnut and or kernel purchased by him and converted into oil and cake if he has paid the tax to the <ORG> on such purchases Provided that the amount for which the oil is sold is included in his net turnover Provided further that the amount of the turnover in respect of which deduction is allowed shall not exceed the amount of the turnover attributable to the groundnut and or kernel used in the manufacture of oil and included in the net turnover A portion of the oleic acid which formed a good part of the content of the groundnut oil in its raw state is converted by the absorption of the hydrogen atoms into stearic acid and it is this which gives the characteristic appearance as well as the semi solid condition which it attains In the language of the Chemist an inter molecular or configurational chemical change take place which results in the hardening of the oil The contention for the dealer was that clause ff of Section of the Act offends Section of the Central Sales Tax Act as it then stood which imposed a restriction on the <ORG> not to tax the same goods at more than one stage The relevant paragraph reads thus Then it is contended that while Section of the Central Sales Tax Act Act of imposes a restriction on the <ORG> not to tax at more than one stage the amending Act by introducing the definition of purchase enables the <ORG> to tax the same goods at the purchase point and at the sale point Clause vi of Section as it stood at the relevant time i prior to the Central Sales Tax Amendment Act read as follows vi Oilseeds that is to say seeds yielding non volatile oils used for human consumption or in industry or in the manufacture of varnishes soaps and the like or in lubrication and volatile oils used chiefly in medicines perfumes cosmetics and the like Words of everyday use must be construed not in their scientific or technical sense but as understood in common parlance It was held that by cutting the pineapple into slices and thereafter canning it on adding sugar to preserve it did not change the identity nor did it bring into existence different goods Strong reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the dealers on the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> of Gujarat <NAME> where it was held that sugar processed into patasa harda and alchidana continued to be SCC SCC Tax STC Supp SCC SCC Tax STC STC SC sugar and that by the said process the essential characteristic and identity of Sugar did not undergo a change The following observations bring out the ratio It is not disputed on behalf of the appellant that the chemical composition of patasa harda and alchidana is the same as that of sugar viz But this circumstance has no relevance on the question of legal classification for the purpose of the Bombay Sales Tax Act On the other hand it appears from the judgment of <ORG> that it is possible to convert these articles into sugar by dissolving them in water and by subjecting the solution to an appropriate process Certain decisions of <ORG> have been brought to our notice by counsel for both sides This submission would have carried some force if all the <ORG> in the country had taken one uniform view and we proposed to upset it As we shall SCC SCC Tax STC SCC SCC Tax presently point out there is no such unanimity nor can it be said that decisions holding in favour of the dealers have held the field for a long time State of A It was held by a Bench that ravva derived from rice is a different product from rice and that therefore ravva is not declared goods within the meaning of Section of the Central Sales Tax Act The <ORG> has taken the view that they are same goods In fact this decision was referred with approval by <ORG> but was dissented from by <ORG> We have been informed that recently <ORG> has taken the same view as <ORG> and that a special leave petition has been filed against it in this Court We therefore set aside the judgments of the Karnataka and Patna <ORG> and accordingly allow Civil Appeal Nos of of of of and I A Nos and of in A No of filed by the said States and dismiss the appeals preferred by the dealers being Civil Appeal Nos of SLP Nos of and of against the judgments of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan
