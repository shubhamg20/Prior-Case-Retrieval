The petitioners in each of these two special civil applications are the same namely a limited company carrying on business of manufacturing textile cloth in Ahmedabad The two special civil applications refer to separate notices issued by the second respondent in each of these special civil application under section a of the Income tax Act seeking to reopen assessments for different years and the grounds on which the assessments are sought to be re opened are identical At the time of assessment according to the petitioners they had disclosed truly and fully all particulars necessary for the grants of depreciation allowance and had also furnished the relevant particulars of sale of assets in the respective assessment years as and when such sales took place This action was proposed because according to the second respondent the petitioners had been granted excessive depreciation allowance in assessment years to and the second respondent further stated in the said letter that certain capital gains arising on transfer of assets had not been assessed in assessment years to By the letter dated March the petitioners intimated to the second respondent that the action proposed to be taken by the second respondent was without jurisdiction and or without authority of law The petitioners further contended that no income had escaped assessment by reason of failure or omission on the part of the petitioners to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessments for the relevant years Thereafter two notices both dated March were issued by the second respondent These notices were issued as according to the second respondent income chargeable to tax for the said two assessments years had escaped assessment within the meaning of section of the Act and the second respondent proposed to reassess the income for the said assessment years and had called upon the petitioners to submit returns in the prescribed form Thereafter on January two further notices were issued by the second respondent in respect of assessment years and and these notices exhibit collectively to Special Civil Application No of have been challenged in that special civil application In order to appreciate the rival contentions at this stage it is necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act of It is obvious that since the provisions of section could not be invoked because the period of limitation of four years from the assessment years under consideration had expired and since there was a period of eight year even for invoking the provisions of section a of the Act of the second respondent proposed to confine his action to the depreciation allowance granted to the petitioner company during the assessment years to because those four years would be within the period of eight years immediately preceding March Under that sub section where any building machinery plant or furniture which is owned by the assessee and which was or has been used for the purpose of business or profession is sold discarded demolished or destroyed and the moneys payable in respect of such building machinery plant or furniture as the case may be together with the amount of scrap value if any exceed the written down value so much of the excess as does not exceed the difference between the actual cost and the written down value shall be chargeable to Income tax as income of the business of profession of the previous year in which the moneys payable for the building machinery plant or furniture became due and if there is any surplus still left then it would be charged as capital gains under section of the Act of As <NAME> and <NAME> in the Commentaries on Income tax Law edition have pointed out at page Where any allowance or deduction had earlier been made in respect of any loss expenditure or trading liability and subsequently the assessee has obtained or realised any amount towards such loss expenditure or trading liability section deems such realisation etc It is against this background of the provisions of law that we have to consider the validity of the notices issued under section of the Act of The question therefore that we have to consider is whether there was any escapement of income from assessment by reason of any failure or omission on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of the petitioner for the relevant year Merely because the Income tax authorities changed their practice or started applying the provisions of section in full force it cannot be said that that part of the sale proceeds which was deemed income as profit under section escaped assessment by reason of any omission or failure on the part of the assessee that it the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment for the assessment year under consideration It is true that excess depreciation had been allowed to the petitioner company that is depreciation allowance in excess of what was permissible to it in view of the provisions of section vi proviso clause inasmuch as the aggregate of all depreciation allowance ordinary allowance plus initial depreciation allowance was in excess of the original cost and therefore it cannot be gainsaid that by virtue of excess depreciation allowance having been granted income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment The question however is whether there was any omission of failure on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessments inasmuch as the amount of initial depreciation was not disclosed by it to the Income tax Officer at the time of the assessment for the relevant year and secondly whether the income had escaped assessment by reason of such omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company because it is only if the income has escaped assessment by reason of such omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company that the Income tax Officer can have reason to believe that by reason of such omission of failure on the part of the petitioner company income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment and then only the Income tax Officer the second respondent herein would get jurisdiction to proceed under section a At page <NAME> as he then was delivering the judgment of <ORG> has pointed out Section confers jurisdiction upon the Income tax Officer to issue a notice in respect of the assessment beyond the period of four years but within a period of eight years from the end of the relevant years if two conditions exist that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to Income tax had been under assessed and that he has also reason to believe that such under assessment has occurred by reason of either i omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under section or ii omission or failure on the part of an assessee to disclose fully and truly all material fats necessary for his assessment for that year These conditions are cumulative and precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to issue a notice of reassessment We are in the present case concerned with the second condition namely that the Income tax Officer must have reason to believe that income escaped assessment or there was under assessment by reason of omission of failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year A similar case came up for consideration before <ORG> in Special Civil Application No of decided by a Division Bench on August The petitioner was a public limited company carrying on business of manufacturing pottery and sanitary were and in respect of assessment year the petitioner filed its return of income before the Income tax Officer Two contentions were urged before <ORG> namely whether the assessee was bound during the course of the Previous assessment proceeding to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment for the relevant years to the assessing authority although such material was admittedly on the record of the department and it was not exclusively within the knowledge of the assessee and whether on a true and proper interpretation of section a of the Act the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to reassess income that had escaped assessment or to recompute loss or depreciation allowance was affected in case where the material necessary for the assessment in respect of which the alleged omission or failure to disclose had occurred is such as could have been gathered by him from an investigation into the records of the department <ORG> therefore rejected the submission made on behalf of the petitioner that since the fact that initial depreciation in respect of certain items of the capital assets of the petitioner was granted to the petitioner under section vi of the Act was already on the record of the department and could have been found out by the Income tax Officer during the course of the previous assessment proceeding by investigation of the record there was no obligation on the part of the petitioner to disclose the said material in the course of its previous assessment proceedings and there was therefore no failure or omission on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material necessary for his assessment for the relevant years within the meaning of section a of the Act In view of this <ORG> judgment with which we are in agreement it is obvious that the petitioner in the present case must be held to have omitted or to have failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of the petitioner company for assessment years to by failing to refer to the grant of initial depreciation that had been granted to it in the past and we well proceed in the course of this judgment on the footing that at least as regards the excess of depreciation allowance granted to it in the past such excess depreciation was allowed and therefore income had escaped assessment for these different years under consideration but the question that still remains to be considered is whether the income chargeable to tax so far as the petitioner was concerned had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly such material facts Just as there was an obligation on the part of the petitioner company to see to it that the factum of initial depreciation was disclosed by it there was also a duty on the part of the Income tax Officer concerned to see to that the aggregate of all allowances in respect of depreciation made under section vi of the Act of did not exceed the original cost to the petitioner company It is therefore not possible for us to say that it was by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company to disclose fully and truly all material fats necessary for its assessment for the relevant years that the income chargeable to tax escaped assessment for those years It was also observed at page The limit to which the Income tax Officer can go back does not stop at the written down value of the previous year by extends up to the figure of the original cost and the method enjoined by section is not that the Income tax Officer should merely sale down the written down value of the previous year but that he should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary take also into consideration the allowances granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the write down value for the assessment year with which he is concerned Hence it is obvious that if the Income tax Officer who passed the assessment orders in the case of the petitioner company at the time of the original assessments for the assessment years to had followed this method which is enjoined upon him and had taken into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary and had taken also into consideration the allowances granted in the past inclusive of the initial allowance and then had made his own computation as to the write down value for the assessment year with which he was concerned it is obvious that no excess depreciation allowance would have been granted for assessment years to though no doubt true chargeable income escaped assessment in the case of excess depreciation allowance and though there was failure or omission on the part of the assessee namely the petitioner company before us in not disclosing fully and truly all material fats which were necessary for the assessment for those four years still it is not possible for us to say that it was only by reason of such omission or failure on the part of the assessee that the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment The income escaped assessment also by reason of the fact that the Income tax Officer concerned in the relevant year had not followed the method enjoined upon him for the purposes of calculating depreciation allowance and not taking into consideration all allowances granted in the past in respect of these different pieces of machinery There also there was a question of initial depreciation in respect of certain machinery and the aggregate of depreciation allowances including initial depreciation on the machinery exceeding the ordinal cost but merely because of the failure on the part of the assessee company to mention the amount of initial depreciation it was not held by <ORG> that income had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment In our opinion therefore sine it is not possible to say that income had escaped assessment by reason of the failure or omission on the part of the petitioner company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessments for the years under consideration the Income tax Officer cannot be said to have reason to believe as had been set out in section a of the Act of Because on neither of these two grounds can it be said that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment the conditions precedent for the exercise of the jurisdiction under section a cannot be said to exist so far as the present cases are concerned The respondents will pay the costs of the petitioner in each of these Special Civil Applications Rule is made absolute accordingly
