in Dollars and in Sterling which on devaluation of the Indian Rupee when converted back to rupees at the post devaluation rates gave rise to a profit of in the transaction the assessee bank credited this surplus to an account designated Provision for Contingencies In the appeals to this Court on behalf of the assessee bank it was contended that the three sums representing interest on sticky advances i advances in respect where of there was high improbability of recovery of even the principal amounts ought not to have been subjected to tax as income under the Act that what are chargeable to income tax in respect of a business are profits and gains actually resulting from the transaction of the previous year that is to say the real profits and gains and not hypothetical profits or gains on a doctrinaire theory of accrual that even under the mercantile system of accounting regularly adopted by an assessee it is only the acrual of real income in the commercial sense which is chargeable to tax that accrual is a matter of substance to be decided on commercial principles having regard to business character of the transaction and the realities of the situation and cannot be determined on any abstract theory of accrual or by adopting a legalistic approach and that if regard is had to the commercial principles and realities of the situation it will be clear that in the case of banks financial institutions and money lenders whose bulk profits mainly consist of interest earned by them there is no accrual of real income so far as interest on sticky advances and the debit entries made in respect of such interest in the respective accounts of the concerned debtors following the mercantile system of accounting merely reflected hypothetical income that does not materialise in the concerned accounting year or years during which the advances remain sticky and hence it is but proper to carry such interest to Interest Suspense Account as carrying the same to Profit and Loss Account would result in showing inflated profits and might even lead to improper and illegal distribution or remittance thereof that there is a clear distinction between an irrevocable loan and a sticky loan the former is a bad debt in respect whereof the chance of recovery is nil and as such can outright form the subject matter of deduction under section i vii of the Act while the latter is a loan to which a high degree of improbability of recovery attaches in a particular year or years depending upon the financial position of the concerned debtor due to which interest thereon becomes hypothetical income during such year or years and as such the same not being real income cannot be brought to tax that right from August onwards till the decision of <ORG>s distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a sticky loan was recognised by <ORG> as also by <ORG> in their diverse Circulars in the case of banks financial institutions and money lenders regularly following the mercantile system of accounting and that Instructions had been issued not to treat the unrealised interest on sticky loans as income by carrying it to Profit and Loss Account so that the figure of distributable profits should not get inflated and preferably to credit the same to a special account Interest Suspense Account and that if the banks financial institutions and money lenders who kept their accounts on mercantile system maintained a suspense account in which the unrealised interest was entered the same should not be included in the assessee taxable income if the Income Tax Officer was satisfied that there was really probability of the loans being repaid that the Instructions contained in various Circulars were in consonance with the accepted principle that what was chargeable under the Income Tax Act was the real income of an assessee but these instructions which held field for over years were changed though wrongly under fresh circulars issued by <ORG> whereunder interest on doubtful or sticky loans became includible in the assessable income of the assessee with effect from the assessment year and that in the case of banks and financial institutions who regularly adopted mercantile system of accounting the practice of carrying interest on such sticky loans to Interest Suspense Account or Reserve for Doubtful Interest Account in stead of crediting the same to Interest Account or Profit and Loss Account is a universally recognised practice invariably adopted by them and being wholly consistent with the mercantile system of accounting the Income Tax Officer was bound to give effect to it under section of the Act and therefore the treatment of the three sums representing interest on sticky loans as the assessee income for the concerned years would be unsustainable in law On behalf of the <ORG> it was contended that though it is the real income that is chargeable to tax under the Act and not any hypothetical income of an assessee and that under section in respect of a business the chargeability must attach to real profits and gains arising from the transactions of the previous year but under section read with section of the Act the liability attaches to profits which have been either received by the assessee or which have accrued to him during the year of account and that income accrues when it falls due i becomes legally recoverable irrespective of whether actually received or not and accrued income is that income which the assessee has a legal right to receive and since the assessee has been maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis the three sums being interest on loans whether doubtful or sticky fell due and became payable to the assessee at the end of each of the three accounting years and constituted its accrued income and therefore justifiably brought to tax in the concerned assessment years that though while imposing the tax liability under the Act the Courts have recognised the theory of real income by having regard to the business character of the transactions and realities of the situation but these aspects have been taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the income could be said to have legally accrued or not and once it is found to have legally accrued it is brought to tax and that the theory of real income has been invoked and confined only to two types of cases a where there has been a surrender of income which may in theory have accrued and where there has been diversion of income at source either under a statute or by over riding title but in none of the cases has the aspect of high improbability of recovery been regarded as sufficient to prevent accrual therefore the theory of real income should not be extended so as to exclude from chargeability such income which has accrued but merely suffers from high improbability of recovery because such extention would be neither permissible nor advisable not permissible because it goes against the very concept of accrued income and not advisable because if done it will apply to all cases and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions However in examining any transaction or situation the court would have more regard to the reality of the situation rather than purely theoretical or doctrinaire aspect A sum of money as soon as it becomes payable is taken into account without reference to actual receipt and a debit becomes admissible when liability to pay is created even though the sum of money is yet to be paid After debiting the debtor account and not reversing that entry but taking the interest merely in suspense account cannot be such evidence to show that no real income has accrued to the assessee or treated as such by the assessee It must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case In some limited fields where something which is the reality of the situation prevents the accrual of the income then the notion of the real income i making the income accrue in the real sense of the term can be brought into play but the notion of real income cannot be brought into play where income has accrued according to the accounts of assessee and there is no indication by the assessee to treat the amount as not having accrued The following Judgments were delivered TULZAPURKAR These appeals by certificate from <ORG> raise the following two interesting questions of law for our determination Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the addition of the sum of Rs arising on devaluation of the Indian rupee on was rightly treated as income for the assessment year The facts giving rise to the first question lie in a narrow compass and are these Profit and Loss Account and despite the fact that the assessee bank had in pursuance thereof ommitted such interest from its Profit and Loss Account the Court had taken the view that such interest was taxable as income in the hands of the assessee bank because of the mercantile system of accounting that had been regularly employed by it which had not been changed even after receiving the directive from <ORG> Incidentally it may be stated in the case of this very assessee <ORG> following the decision herein took a similar view and answered a similar question against the assessee for the subsequent year which decision rendered in is reported in ITR Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the assessee raised a two fold contention in support of his plea that the three sums representing interest on sticky advances i advances in respect whereof there was high improbability of recovery of even the principal amounts ought not to have been subjected to tax as income under the Act In the first place he contended that what are chargeable to income tax in respect of a business are profits and gains actually resulting from the transactions of the previous year that is to say the real profits and gains and not hypothetical profits or gains on a doctrinaire theory of accrual that even under the mercantile system of accounting regularly adopted by an assessee it is only the accrual of real income in the commercial sense which is chargeable to tax that accrual is a matter of substance to be decided on commercial principles having regard to business character of the transactions and the realities of the situation and cannot be determined on any abstract theory of accrual or by adopting a legalistic approach and that if regard is had to commercial principles and realities of the situation it will be clear that in the case of banks financial institutions and money lenders whose bulk profits mainly consist of interest earned by them there is no accrual of real income so far as interest on sticky advances is concerned and the debit entries made in respect of such interest in the respective accounts of the concerned debtors following the mercantile system of accounting merely reflect hypothetical income that does not materialise in the concerned accounting year or years during which the advances remain sticky and hence it is but proper to carry such interest to Interest Suspense Account as carrying the same to Profit and Loss Account would result in showing inflated profits and might even lead to improper and illegal distribution or remittance thereof According to Counsel there is a clear distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a sticky loan the former is a bad debt in respect whereof the chance of recovery is nil and as such can out right form the subject matter of deduction under vii of the Act while the latter is a loan to which a high degree of improbability of recovery attaches in a particular year or years depending upon the financial position of the concerned debtor due to which interest thereon becomes hypothetical income duringsuch year or years and as such the same not being real income cannot be brought to tax Counsel pointed out that right from August onwards till the impugned decision herein as also the further decision in ITR were rendered by <ORG> in and respectively the aforesaid distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a stickly loan was recognised by <ORG> as also by <ORG> in their diverse Circulars in the case of banks financial institutions and money lenders regularly following the mercantile system of accounting and he further pointed out that Instructions had been issued not to treat the unrealised interest on such sticky loan as income by carrying it to Profit and Loss Account so that the figure of distributable profits should not get inflated and preferably to credit the same to a special account such as Interest Suspense Account and that if the banks financial institutions and money lenders who kept their accounts on mercantile system maintained such a suspense account in which the unrealised interest was entered the same should not be included in the assessee taxable income if the Income Tax Officer was satisfied that there was really little probability of the loans being repaid Counsel urged that such Instructions contained in these Circulars were in consonance with the accepted principle that what was chargeable under the Income Tax Act was the real income of an assessee but according to him these Instructions which held field for over years were changed though wrongly under fresh Circulars dated June and October issued by <ORG> whereunder such interest on doubtful or sticky loans became includible in the assessable income of the assessee subject to some relief specified therein with effect from the assessment year Secondly counsel contended that in any view of the matter in the case of banks and financial institutions who regularly adopt mercantile system of accounting the practice of carrying interest on such sticky loans to Interest Suspense Account or Reserve for Doubtful Interest Account instead of crediting the same to Interest Account or Profit and Loss Account is a universally recoginsed practice invariably adopted by them and being wholly consistent with the mercantile system of accounting the Income Tax Officer was bound to give effect to it under of the Act and therefore the treatment of the three sums representing interest on sticky loans as the assessee income for the concerned assessment years would be unsustainable in law and in this behalf counsel placed reliance on the standard text books of accountancy of authors like <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and the Approved Text of International Accounting Standard <ORG> through its successors <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> of India sought our permission to intervene in these appeals and we granted the requisite permission in view of the importance of the issues involved and it may be stated that Counsel appearing for the interveners have adopted the arguments of Mr <NAME> and generally supported the submissions made by him on behalf of the assessee in these appeals but special mention may be made of the fact that in the written submissions filed on their behalf it has been categorically asserted that while maintaining their accounts regularly on mercantile system each one of these institutions in the matter of interest on doubtful or sticky loans invariably follow the practice of debiting such interest to the account of concerned borrower but instead of crediting it to Interest Account or Profit and Loss Account the same is carried to a special account styled Interest Suspense Account or Reserve for Doubtful Interest Account and only upon realisation the same is credited to Interest Account and Profit and loss Account in the year of realisation and is offered for taxation Counsel reiterated on behalf of the Intervenees that the benefit under the earlier Circulars of and I did not depend upon the ipse dixit of the assessee but was available only if the safeguards specified therein were observed and the taxing authority was satisfied on objective materials that the loan had become sticky and there was really little probability of the same being repaid Counsel for the revenue fairly conceded that Courts have while imposing the tax liability under the Act recognised the theory of real income by having regard to the business character of the transactions and realities of the situation but these aspects have been taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the income could be said to have legally accrued or not and once it is found to have legally accrued it is brought to tax Counsel submitted such extension would be neither permissible nor advisable not permissible because it goes against the very concept of accrued income and not adyisable because if done it will apply to all cases and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions Having regard to the rival contentions urged before us by counsel on either side it is clear that the following questions do arise for our serious consideration on the first issue raised for determination in these appeals Did the three sums representing interest on sticky loans constitute real income of the assessee for the concerned assessment years Had such income really accrued to the assessee for those years Does real accrual of income depend on its falling due by mere lapse of requisite contractual period at the end of which it becomes legally payable or upon the business character of the transaction and the realities of the situation How far is the method of accounting regularly adopted by the assessee here mercantile relevant for deciding the question of real accrual What is the effect of making debit entries in respect of such interest in the respective accounts of the concerned debtors under the mercantile system of accounting And lastly can and should the theory of real income be extended so as to exclude a particular income from chargeability under the Act because of high improbability of recovery attaching to it in the concerned accounting year or years We would like to deal with these questions in the light of decided cases Section provides that income chargeable under the head Profits and Gains of Business shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee provided that in any case where the accounts are correct and completed to the satisfaction of the Income Tax Officer but the method is such that in his opinion the income cannot be properly deduced therefrom then the computation shall be made upon such basis and in such manner as the Income Tax Officer may determine but where he is not satisfied about the correctness or completeness of the accounts of the assessee or where no method of accounting has been regularly employed by the assessee he can proceed to make the assessment to the best of his judgment This is made clear by defining in subsection the word paid which is used in several clauses of sub section as meaning actually paid or incurred according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the profits or gains are computed under section Again where the cash system is adopted there is no question of bad debts or outstandings at all in the case of mercantile system against the book profit some of the bad debts may have to be set off when they are found to be irrecoverable On the aspect as to how far and to what extent a method of accounting has a bearing on the question of real accrual of income the <ORG> has made the following significant observation at page of the Report But the section section of the Act equivalent to section of the Act only deals with a computation of income profits and gains for the purposes of sections and sections and of the Act and does not purport to enlarge or restrict the content of taxable income profits and gains under the Act Obviously for the content of taxable income one must have regard to the substantive charging provisions of the Act In other words any hypothetical income which may have the oretically accrued but has not truly resulted or materialised in the concerned accounting year cannot be brought to charge simply because the assessee has been regularly employing the mercantile system of accounting and makes entries in his books in regard to such hypothetical income In the light of above I would recapitulate the admitted facts and the manner in which the assessee treated or dealt with the three sums representing interest on sticky loans in its books pursuant to the mercantile system of accounting regularly adopted by it The facts that the advances or loans had during the concerned accounting years become sticky and that such interest had not materialised or resulted to the assessee in those years were not disputed but as stated earlier the claim was negatived by the taxing authorities and the <ORG> on the ground that the advances or loans had not been treated as irrecoverable or bad debts under vii that the aspect that the advances or loans had become sticky was irrelevant that since the assessee was following the mercantile system of accounting such interest has accrued to it at the end of each accounting year and that the assessee had itself shown the accrual of interest by changing the same to the concerned parties by making debit entries in their accounts As regards the mercantile system of accounting regularly employed by the assessee there are two aspects which we like to stress In other words simply because the assessee has been regularly employing the mercantile system of accounting it would not mean that any hypothetical income which may have theoretically accrued but has not truly resulted to him in the concerned accounting year can be brought to charge and therefore the question whether the three sums representing interest on sticky loans had really accrued to the assessee or not would be a matter of substance and cannot be determined by merely having regard to the method of accounting here mercantile system adopted by the assessee Secondly it will have to be borne in mind that this is not a case where the assessee had ignored or failed to make any entries at all in regard to such interest on advances or loans which had become sticky in its books maintained on mercantile system but it had charged such interest by debiting the accounts of concerned debtors and had designedly credited it to Interest Suspense Account instead of carrying it to Profit and Loss Account with a view to avoid showing unreal or inflated profits Counsel for the assessee pointed out that after all the primary purpose of book keeping whatever be the method of accounting was to make a systematic record of business transactions in a manner which must show the correct financial position of a business house at a given point of time and reflect the real and true profits of the business done by it during the year of account and contended that in treating the three sums in question in the manner done the assessee had merely followed a universally recognised practice invariably adopted by banks and financial institutions who maintain their accounts on mercantile system and what was more this practice accorded with the principle that no item should be treated as income unless it has been actually received or has accrued in the sense that there is reasonable certainty that it will be realised I find considerable force in this contention of counsel for the assessee Turning to the first question it is true that under taxabillity is attracted not merely when income is actually received but also when it has accrued and it is also true as has been explained by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and <ORG> case supra that income accrues when it falls due that is to say when it becomes legally recoverable irrespective of whether it is actually received or not and accrued income is that income which the assessee has a legal right to receive Incidentally it may be stated that in both of these cases where the legal aspect of accrual has been explained no question of applying the doctrine of real income could arise for in the former case after the commission payable to the managing agents had accrued at the end of the accounting year the managed company had instead of paying it kept it in a suspense account pending settlement of a dispute in regard to another debt owed to it by the managing agents which proposed settlement was ultimately rejected and the <ORG> held that such keeping it in the suspense account pending settlement of another indebtedness would not prevent its accrual to the managing agents while in the other case a unilateral relinquishment of the commission by the managing agents was after its accrual and hence the <ORG> ruled that it could not escape liability to tax Emphasis supplied The above observations were made in the context of these facts but as a result of resolutions passed by the managed company and the assessee company the assessee gave up a sum of Rs It will be significant to mention that during the hearing of the Reference counsel for the revenue raised a contention that even if the amount of Rs had been foregone by the assessee company on grounds of commercial expediency that was not done in the accounting year which ended on March but it was done in December as a result of two resolutions one passed by the managed company and the other passed by the assessee company and that since admittedly the assessee was following the mercantile system of accounting it could not avail of the benefit of the doctrine of real income where the income by way of the managing agency commission had been credited in the books in the year of account and had been surrendered by it in the next year in other words it was specifically urged that if the surrender was not made and entered in the books in the same year no question of real income could arise and in this behalf counsel relied upon the well settled rule that for purposes of income tax each year was required to be regarded as a distinct and self contained unit Mr <NAME> counsel for the revenue also is not prepared to go so far as that and has fairly stated that there is no antithesis between the two rules we shall proceed on the footing that the assessee company having followed the mercantile system of account there must have been entries made in its books in the accounting year in respect of the amount of the commission odd is to be regarded as of cogency in the context of the present point of real income and if it be remembered that the surrender was made at the time of ascertaining the quantum of the commission payable to the assessee company and further if it be remembered as now found by the <ORG> that the surrender was made bona fide and on grounds solely of commercial expediency it seems very difficult to us to see how the <ORG> is justified in contending that the real income of the assessee was something different than the amount of Rs The <ORG> further expressed the view that the principle of real income was not to be so subordinated as to amount virtually to a negation of it when a surrender or concession or rebate in respect of managing agency commission is made agreed to or given up on grounds of commercial expediency simply because it takes place some time after the close of the accounting year and that in examining any transaction and situation of this nature the <ORG> would have more regard to the reality and speciality of the situation rather than the purely theoretical or doctrinaire aspect of it and it will lay greater emphasis on the business aspect of the matter viewed as a whole when that can be done without disregarding the decision of the Bombay High <ORG> has been fully approved by this <ORG> in <ORG> case supra If therefore for the purpose of determining whether there has been accrual of real income or not regard is to be had to the business character of the transactions and the realities and specialities of the situation in preference to theoretical doctrinaire or legalistic approach I fail to appreciate why interest on sticky loans which has theoretically accrued but has not factually resulted or materialised at all to an assessee hypothetical income and not real income There is no reason why the factum of stickiness of loans operating throughout the accounting period or periods not on the basis of mere ipse dixit of the assessee but on being objectively established to the satisfaction of the taxing authorities by reference to the facts showing the deteriorating financial position of the concerned debtors and the history of their accounts should not have the effect of preventing the accrual of interest thereon as real income to the assessee If voluntary relinquishment or surrender of income done unilaterally or as a result of bilateral arrangement can prevent its real accrual there is no reason why the factum of stickiness of loans objectively established should not prevent accrual of interest thereon as real income I am therefore clearly of the view that the stickiness of advances or loans objectively established to the satisfaction of the taxing authorities by producing proper material is sufficient to prevent the accrual of interest thereon as real income and would have the effect of rendering such income hypothetical and the same cannot be brought to tax Counsel for the revenue raised two objections to extend the theory of real income so as to exclude from chargeability the interest on sticky loans merely because it suffers from high improbability of recovery In the first place he urged that the Act contains no provision excluding or deducting such interest from computation of income and the only provision for deduction of debts is to be found in vii where under debts which are established to have become irrecoverable and bad in the previous year are permitted to be deducted on fulfilment of certain conditions specified in sub section and as such the extension of the theory of real income as sought would entrench upon vi Secondly it was urged that such extension will be ill advised inasmuch as if done it will apply to cases of interest accruing to all money lenders and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions proceeds on the basis that in substance such debts do not constitute real income of the assessee and therefore exclusion of interest on sticky loans from computation of income for which there is no provision in the Act and that too without any conditions would impinge upon the specific provision contained in vii read with sub section Moreover there is a clear distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a sticky loan the former would be a bad debt in respect whereof the chances of recovery are almost nil having been written off the same can form the subject matter of a deduction under vii while the latter is a loan to which a high degree of improbability of recovery attaches in a particular year or years due to which interest thereon becomes hypothetical income and not real income during the said year or years and therefore it cannot be brought to tax though if realised subsequently the same could be and ought to be brought to tax if this distinction is borne in mind no question of impinging upon the provision contained in vii read with sub section can arise by extending the theory of real income to the interest on sticky loans Directly on the point at issue there are five decisions which we need consider In <NAME> case decided by <ORG> the items of interest receivable from two parties on advances made to them were sought to be excluded from computation of income of the assessee for on the ground that since the assessee had decided to change its method of accounting in respect of interest which was doubtful of recovery by crediting the same to the Suspense Account and also on the ground that before the closing of the books of account of the relevant accounting year the assessee had adbandoned its claim for such interest <ORG> held that there was no change in the mercantile system of accounting that had all along been empolyed by the assessee that the transfer of items of interest to Suspense Account could not be termed as a change in the method of accounting and therefore the amounts were assessable on accrual basis as regards the other ground <ORG> held that though there was difficulty in realising the interest in the year of account there was no material to show that there was any agreement with the debtors to waive the interest or to keep it in the Suspense Account and hence the claim for interest had not been given up As the assessee company was advised that there was no prospect of recovering even the principal amount it did not credit the interest on the outstandings from the two firms even though it was adopting the mercantile system of accounting On a reference at the instance of the Commissioner the Madras High court held that the <ORG> was right in its conclusion that though the assessee had adopted the mercantile system of accounting no interest income could be assessed in its hands on accrual basis and it would be very unrealistic on the part of the assessee to take credit for the highly illusory interest It further observed that it was not the hypothetical accrual of income based on the mercantile system of accounting followed by the assessee that had to be taken into account but what should be considered was whether the income had really materialised or resulted to the assessee and that question had to be considered with reference to commercial and business realities of the situation in which the assessee had been placed and not with reference to his system of accounting and held that since there was not even the remotest possibility of any interest income materialising in favour of the assessee in respect of the outstandings for the accounting year relevant to the assessment year in question no liability to tax could be imposed on the assessee I approve these three decisions Having regard to the above discussion it is clear that the three sums representing interest on sticky advances in the instant case being hypothetical and not real income of the assessee could not be brought to tax for the three concerned assessment years and we answer the first question in the negative in favour of the assessee and against the revenue Of course it goest without saying that if and when these sums or any part thereof are realised subsequently the same could be brought to tax in the year of realisation The facts giving rise to the question are these amounting to in US Dollars and in Sterling which when converted back to Rupees at the post devaluation rates gave rise to a profit of or Rs It was contended on behalf of the assessee before the lower taxing authorities that this profit should not be taxed as it was of a casual and nonrecurring nature The contention was negatived by the authorities on the ground that even assuming without conceding that it was a windfall and therefore of a casual nature the same had arisen from the business activities of the assessee bank and therefore was not exempt but was liable to tax Before <ORG> an attempt was made by counsel for the assessee bank to contend that the cash balance in terms of dollars and sterlings at the end of the accounting period i on December was higher than that as existed on the crucial date namely August and therefore this precluded any inference that the stock of dollars and sterlings that existed on the devaluation date had been converted into Indian currency thus resulting in profits The <ORG> rejected the contention as being without force inasmuch as the assessee bank had revalued the cost of foreign exchange in terms of rupees as on the date of devaluation to bring it on par with the post devaluation rate by giving a corresponding credit to the Provision for Contingencies thus treating the surplus resulting from the fluctuation of exchange rate as its income and the mere fact that the same had been carried to the account style Provision for Contingencies did not alter the true character of the transaction Having regard to the aforesaid factual position I confirm <ORG> view that the second question has to be answered in the affirmative in favour of the <ORG> and against the assessee In the result I would allow the appeals in so far as the first question is concerned and dismiss the same as regards the second question The following two questions are involved in these appeals Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the addition of the sums of Rs Rs arising on revaluation of the Indian rupee on was rightly treated as income of the assessment year In view of the categorical findings of fact recorded by the <ORG> authorities and the <ORG> and mentioned in the judgment of <NAME> I am in respectful agreement with the opinion of <NAME> that <ORG> was right and the second question must be answered in the affirmative and in favour of the revenue and the appeals on this aspect must be dismissed It is necesary for this reason to reiterate in brief the facts relating to the first question In view of the relevant years involved the question must be considered in the light of the provisions of the Income Tax Act hereinafter called the Act This contention was however rejected by the Income tax authorities as well as <ORG> Reliance was placed by <ORG> on an earlier decision of the same <ORG> in the case of <ORG> In liquidation vs <ORG> Kerala Ernakulam In that case in spite of the directions issued by <ORG> to the assessee bank not to carry interest of such sticky advances to Profit and Loss Account and also in spite of the fact that the assessee bank in pursuance of these directions omitted their interest from its Profit and Loss Account the court took the view that such interest was taxable as income in the hands of the assessee bank because the mercantile system of accounting had been regularly followed by the bank and that had not been changed even after receiving directions from <ORG> <ORG> was of the view that the facts of the instant case out of which these appeals arise being the same as those in <ORG> case except that there was a direction from <ORG> to <ORG> which is absent in the instant case before us the same conclusion must follow The assessee indubitably maintained its accounts on mercantile basis and had regularly adopted it The assessee claimed that the three sums represented interests on what it called sticky loans in its books of account but having regard to the deteriorating financial position of the concerned debtors and the history of these accounts the assessee was of the view that in the relevant years the advances had become so sticky that even the recovery of the principal amounts had become highly improbable and extremely doubtful Therefore though the assessee charged such interests by debiting the concerned parties emphasis supplied yet it credited the said amounts to a separate account styled as Interest Suspense Account It was submitted that even under the mercantile system of accounting accrual or real income in the commercial sense only was chargeable to tax and this must accrue in substance according to the realities of the situation It was submitted that if regard is had to realities of the situation as well as the actual commercial principles it would be evident that in cases of banks financial institutions and money lenders bulk of the income is usually earned by way of interest and as such there cannot be any accrual of real income from interest on doubtful advances or sticky advances and therefore the entries made in respect of such accounts in case of all such traders following the mercantile system of accounting only reflected hypothetical income which does not materialise in income A sum of money as soon as it becomes payable is taken into account without reference to actual receipt and a debit becomes admissible when liability to pay is created even though the sum of money is yet to be paid It was indicated therein that when there was unlikelihood of loans being recovered interests from such loans need not be included in the taxable income if the Income tax Officer was satisfied that there was really little possibility of the loans being repaid There is also a letter dated th April from the Under Secretary <ORG> referring to letter dated th March reiterating that the amounts kept in suspense account under those circumstances would not be taxable In that letter reference was made to the previous circulars and it was pointed out that the stand taken in these circulars was not acceptable to <ORG> and it had objected to the exclusion of such amounts of interest from the total income It was urged that the instructions contained in these circulars noted before were in consonance with the accepted principles of accountancy and these instructions have held the field for over years The question of how far the concept or real income enters into the question of taxability in the facts and circumstances of this case and how far and to what extent the concept of real income should inter mingle with the accrual of income will have to be judged in the light of the provisions of the Act the principles of accountancy recognised and followed and the feasibility There is no dispute in these appeals that such conditions are not satisfied Sub section of the said section provides that income chargeable under the head Profits and gains of business or profession or Income from other sources shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee The <ORG> held that the assessee was being assessed on cash basis in previous years that the income had not accrued to the assessee and that the sum of Rs <ORG> came to the conclusion that there was no material for the <ORG> finding that the assessee was being assessed on cash basis in the previous years but held <NAME> confirming the decision of the Appellate <ORG> <NAME> contra that the sum of Rs This <ORG> in appeal held that <ORG> was right in its conclusion that there was no material for the <ORG> finding that the assessee was being assessed on cash basis on the sums mentioned which had accrued to the assessee and it did not cease to be income The learned Chief Justice observed at page of the report Now there are two methods of accounting for the income profits and gains of a business which are generally referred to as the cash basis and the mercantitle basis Lord Thankerton speaking for <ORG> after referring to section of Act which was more or less similar to section of the present Act observed at page as follows Their Lordships are clearly of opinion that the section relates to a method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee for his own purposes in this case for the purposes of the Company business and does not relate to a method of making up the statutory return of assessment to income tax This is made clear by defining in sub section the word paid which is used in several clauses of sub section as meaning actually paid or incurred according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the profits or gains are computed under section Again where the cash system is adopted there is no question of bad debts or outstanding at all in the case of mercantile system against the book profits some of the bad debts may have to be set of when they are found to be irrecoverable For the content of the taxable income one has to refer to the substantive provisions of the Act mainly section of the Act read with other relevant sections It may be reiterated that in some limited fields where something which is the reality of the situation prevents the accrual of the income then the notion of real income i making the income accrue in the real sense of the term can be brought into play but the notion of real income as it shall presently be indicated cannot be brought into play where income has accrued according to the accounts of the assessee and there is no indication by the assessee to treat the amount as not having accrued In that case there was provision for reduction of commission where profits were insufficient in case of the managing agent but as a result of the resolutions passed by the managed company and the assessee company the assessee gave up a sum of Rs The principle of real income is not to be so subordinated to virtually amount to a negation of it when a surrender or concession or rebate in respect of managing agency commission is made agreed to or given on grounds of commercial expediency simply because it takes place some time after the close of an accounting year In examining any transaction and situation of this nature the court would have more regard to the reality and speciality of the situation rather than the purely theoretical and doctrinaire aspect of it Under the agreement there was a duty to forgo upto one third of the commission where profit of the managed company was not sufficient to pay a divident of per cent Carrying certain amount which had accrued as interest without treating it as bad debt or irrecoverable interest but keeping in suspense account would be repugnant to section vii read with section of the Act In that view of the matter <NAME> case would not be of any assistance to the assessee for the contentions it sought to urge before this Court in the instant case Dealing with <NAME> case this Court observed that an argument was advanced before this Court that as the assessee was maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis the commission had accrued This contention did not find favour with this Court because this Court noted that no due date was fixed for payment of the commission under the managing agency agreement It was held in that case after discussing the facts that there were hardly any receipts in respect of items of interest or that the bona fides of the assessee in not charging interest were not disputed were circumstances which were by themselves insufficient to support the conclusion that there was no real income in respect of the items of interest as none of the debts due by the several debtors was written off by the assessee and no evidence was produced to show that interest in respect of the debts was given up The assessee has not only not written off but it is still treating loans as alive by keeping them in suspense account It urged that it had decided to change st January its method of accounting in respect of interest which was doubtful of recovery and that such interest was thence forward credited to the suspense account The <ORG> held that there was no change in the method of accounting and that before the closing of the books of account of the relevant accounting year the assessee had not abandoned its claim of interest and as such the amounts were assessable on accrual basis There is no claim that there was any change in the method of accounting <ORG> further held in <NAME> case that though there was difficulty in realising the interests in the year of account there was no material to show that there was any agreement with the debtors to waive the interest or to keep these in suspense account I the assessee a private company was carrying on business as financier for purchase of motor vehicles on hire purchase As the assessee company was advised that there was no prospect of recovering even the principal amount the assessee company did not credit the interest on the outstandings from the two companies even though it was adopting the mercantile system of accounting Therefore there was no question of paying any hiring charges or interest If no income had materialised it was pointed out there could be no liability to tax on any hypothetical accrual of income based on the mercantile system of accounting followed by the asessee that had to be taken into account but what should be considered was whether the income had really materialised or resulted to the assessee The question whether real income had materialised to the assessee had to be considered with reference to commercial and business realities of the situation The <ORG> was justified in <ORG> view that having regard to the terms of the agreement entered into between the parties and in the light of the entries contained in the accounts the commission could not be said to have accrued in favour of the assessee as commission could be earnt only after the entire advance had been realised <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the bench noted the distinction between <NAME> case and the case before him in <ORG> There the court came to the conclusion that there was no income in view of the particular facts and circumstances of the case It must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case After debiting the debtor account and not reversing that entry but taking the interest merely in suspense account cannot be such evidence to show that no real income has accrued to the assessee or treated as such by the assessee But in view of the facts and circumstances of these cases parties will bear their own costs throughout <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the two separate judgments by my learned brothren <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> I am in agreement with both of them that the second question had been correctly answered in favour of the <ORG> by <ORG> and the appeals are to be dismissed on affirmation of that conclusion so far as that aspect is concerned Reports The appeals shall stand dismissed with the direction that the parties shall bear their own respective costs throughout
