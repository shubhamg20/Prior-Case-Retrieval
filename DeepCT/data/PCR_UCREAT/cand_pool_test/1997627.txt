This is a tax case appeal by the erstwhile partners of <ORG> against the order of <ORG> revising the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and also the order of assessment of the Joint Commercial Tax Officer Tondiarpet withdrawing the exemption granted with respect to certain turnover for the assessment year The assessee filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner disputing the assessment made on the above two items he gave relief to a turnover of Rs <ORG> have come to the conclusion that the sales of rounds manufactured out of local purchases of iron scrap are also liable to tax though the iron scrap suffered tax earlier in view of the decision of <ORG> reported in <NAME> case STC In the appeal it is contended that the decision reported in <NAME> case is not applicable to the case on hand and the case of the appellants falls under section iv of the Central Sales Tax Act read with corresponding item of the Second Schedule to the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act The learned counsel submitted that <ORG> has exceeded its jurisdiction in revising the assessment beyond the period of limitation prescribed under section of the Act that <ORG> under the guise of revision cannot pass an original order of assessment that <ORG> in exercise of power of revision cannot determine the taxable turnover in excess of the figure arrived at by the assessing officer and that <ORG> cannot set aside simultaneously under section of the Act the order of the Joint Commercial Tax Officer as well as the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner Further there is no substance in the last ground and that the proposal was to revise the order of the assessing officer as well as the appellate authority and therefore it cannot be contended that only one of the orders alone can be revised Section of the Act gives power to the assessing officer to bring to tax the turnover which escaped original assessment and that power can be exercised by the assessing officer within a period of five years from the expiry of the year to which the tax relates Subsequently on a revision the <ORG> rejecting the claim of the assessee that the proceedings by the <ORG> were barred by the limitation of five years passed an original order of assessment refixing the taxable turnover In that case this Court held that in passing an original order of assessment the <ORG> exceeded its powers under section and that the order was also passed beyond time The court held that the power of revision by the <ORG> is subject to the provisions of the Act and section provides a limitation that the assessment should be revised within a period of five years subsequent to the order for which tax is levied and therefore the revision of that assessment under section of the Act is also subject to the restriction placed under section of the Act Thus it was held that the <ORG> of Revenue cannot revise any order by revision after expiry of five years subsequent to the order by which tax was revised under section of the Act and it cannot take the role of the assessing authority by embarking upon a probing enquiry Factually in this case the original assessment was not revised under section of the Act before the assessment was subject to revision by the <ORG> of Revenue The question that was to be decided was whether the exemption granted by the assessing officer with respect to certain turnover was legally correct It is further held that the power of revision by the Deputy Commissioner is a separate and independent power and can be exercised to revise an order of assessment within a period prescribed under that section and it can also be revised by the assessing authority by correcting the mistake or bringing into tax the escaped turnover The revisional order passed by <ORG> is within a period prescribed by that section Therefore the power of limitation prescribed under section of the Act will not apply to the revision in the instant case Therefore if action could be taken under one section it does not follow that action could not be taken under the other Where it is possible to act under two provisions the department may resort to the one instead of the other and it cannot be compelled to proceed under only one of the two provisions Section provides for the examination of the order passed by a subordinate authority under certain provisions set out therein So long as the jurisdiction is exercised with respect to an order contemplated by the section there would be no error in the exercise of jurisdiction it is held that under section of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act the Deputy Commissioner is not confined to the examination of the order proposed to be revised and he can take information from outside the order for the purpose of effectively exercising his powers of revision and he can further peruse the record extraneous to the assessment On a consideration of the above decisions we are of the view that sections and of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act are independent and the limitation prescribed under section will not be applicable to a revision under section of the Act and in any event in this case since the original assessment was not revised under section the limitation prescribed under section will not be applicable to a revision under section Further we are of the view that section gives wide power to reassess the turnover as in the case of the original assessing authority But the facts of the case will clearly establish that it is not a case of reassessment but a case of bringing to tax by withdrawing certain exemptions granted by the assessing authority in respect of certain turnover Therefore the first two submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellants have to fail and accordingly they are rejected But here we find from the records that notice was given to the assessee by <ORG> proposing to revise both the orders of the assessing authority as well as that of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against an order of assessment passed by the Joint Commercial Tax Officer Pondicherry the assessee preferred an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner Pondicherry who reduced the taxable turnover On appeal a Bench of this Court consisting of <NAME> as he then was and <NAME> while setting aside the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the <ORG> cannot redetermine the turnover to be in excess of the turnover determined by the assessing authority because the appellate order was passed at the instance of the assessee and therefore the assessee cannot be placed in a worse position than what he would have been if he had not preferred the appeal by modifying the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to the prejudice of the assessee Hence we are of the view that the third submission made by the learned counsel for the appellants has to be rejected and is accordingly rejected As regards the last contention referring to section of the Act the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the word or used therein implies that <ORG> could revise either the order passed by the assessing officer or the order passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and <ORG> cannot interfere both the orders at the same time since admittedly it is not a case where there is a merger of the original order with the order passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner The <ORG> may of its own motion call for and examine an order passed or proceeding recorded by the appropriate authority under section A section section section or sub section or of section or an order passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under sub section of section or by the Deputy Commissioner under sub section of section and may make such inquiry or cause such inquiry to be made and subject to the provisions of this Act may pass such order thereon as it thinks fit In this case admittedly there is no merger as such Rejecting the above contention <ORG> held that a provision of a statute must be construed in accordance with the language used therein unless there are compelling reasons such as where a literal construction would reduce the provision to absurdity or prevent the manifest intention of the legislature from being carried out The Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the appeal Thereafter <ORG> in exercise of power of revision under section of the Act set aside the exemption granted to the assessee on the entire turnover of six lakhs and this order was within a period of four years from the date of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but beyond the period of four years from the date of the assessment order Since under section of the Act <ORG> can interfere with an order of assessment made by any authority within a period of four years from the date of the order it was held that the <ORG> cannot revise the order of the assessing authority which was beyond the period of four years as prescribed under section of the Act in view of the fact that the theory of merger of the order of assessment with the appellate order is not applicable to this case Therefore this Court held that revision of the assessment order beyond the period prescribed under section of the Act cannot be sustained but it did not say that the <ORG> can interfere only with one order and therefore the order is not sustainable It implies that this Court took the view in the said decision that the <ORG> can interfere with either the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or the assessing officer or of both provided each of the order sought to be revised is within a period of limitation provided in that section Therefore we reject the last contention also
