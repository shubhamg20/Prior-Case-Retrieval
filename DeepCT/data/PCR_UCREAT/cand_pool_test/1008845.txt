Subse quently under instructions from Government the Commissioner sent the following communication to the respondent I am directed by Government to inform you that the permission to erect a cinema at the above site granted to you under the office letter dated th July is hereby canceled The respondent applied to <ORG> for an order under of the Specific Relief Act directing <NAME> Bombay to withdraw the cancellation and to grant permission for the erection of the cinema and <ORG> directed <NAME> to withdraw the order of cancellation passed by him Held i that there was nothing in the letter dated th July to indicate that the decision was not that of the Commissioner himself given in the bona fide exercise of the discretion vested in him ii There was no valid cancellation of the license because a the order of cancellation communicated to the respondent was one made by the Government of Bombay and not by the Commissioner on his own authority he acted in the matter only as a transmitting agent under the rules framed under section and of the City of Bombay Police Act the Government of Bombay had no power to cancel of license once issued iii The relief sought by the respondent of an injunction to direct <NAME> to grant permission for the erection of a cinema could not be granted because he had already granted permission and there was no valid order of cancellation Though there was no specific provision of law compel ling the Commissioner to exercise the discretion vested in him under Rule inasmuch as the enabling power vested by Rule was vested in the Commissioner for the welfare of the public at large it was coupled with a duty to exercise it when the circumstances so demanded vii There was no other specific and adequate legal remedy open to the respondent within the meaning of for though the respondent could have ignored the so called order of cancellation he could only have done so ix Public orders publicly made in exercise of a statu tory authority cannot be construed in the light of explana tions subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant or of what was in his mind or what he intend ed to do Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of <ORG> <ORG> and <NAME> dated th Septem ber in Appeal No of arising out of the Judgment dated nd February of a Single Judge of the same <ORG> <NAME> The facts of the case and arguments of counsel are stated fully in the judgment The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE The question here is whether an order should issue under section of the Specific Relief Act against the appellant who is the Commissioner of <ORG> Bombay Accordingly the respondent made the necessary application on the th of September though they may have weighed and rightly with the Commissioner there is nothing on the face of the letter to indicate that the decision was not that of the Commis sioner himself given in bona fide exercise of the discretion vested in him There is no suggestion that his will was overborne or that there was dishonesty or fraud in what he did Shortly after on the th September the Commissioner sent the respondent the following communica tion I am directed by Government to inform you that the permission to erect a cinema at the above site granted to you under this office letter dated the th July is hereby cancelled We have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that this is not an order of cancellation by the Commission er but merely intimation by him of an order passed and made by another authority namely the Government of Bombay We are clear that public orders public ly made in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant or of what was in his mind or what he intended to do Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the acting and conduct of those to hum they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself Turning now to the language used we are clear that by no stretch of imagination can this be construed to be an order which in effect says I so and so by virtue of the authority vested in me do hereby order and direct this and that If the Commissioner of Police had the power to cancel the license already grant ed and was the proper authority to make the order it was incumbent on him to say so in express and direct terms Public authorities cannot play fast and loose with the powers vested in them and persons to whose detriment orders are made are entitled to know with exactness and precision what they are expected to do or forbear from doing and exactly what authority is making the order But if there is ambiguity or doubt in the language used here a glance at the surrounding circumstances will dispel it They said on the th November Our client has been advised that the authority to grant permission is in you acting in consultation with <ORG> The Commissioner reply dated th December was I write to inform you that permission granted to your client was cancelled under the orders of the Government who may be approached We are clear that this roundabout language would not have been used if the order of cancellation had been that of the Commissioner We do not mean to suggest that it would have been improper for him to take into consideration the views and wishes of <ORG> provided he did not surrender his own judgment and provided he made the order but we hold on the material before us that the order of cancellation came from <ORG> and that the Commissioner acted only as a transmitting agent Rule applies to any person desirous of erecting a cinema building There is in our opinion a distinction of principles between the erection and use of buildings for purely private and residential purposes and those intended to be used as places of public amusement Ordinarily a man can do what he likes with his property subject of course to specific laws regulating his use of it there fore in the case of a private residence he would in a general way have a right to build if he complies with all the rules and regulations and restrictions which may be imposed by law and if permission is withheld when all the conditions are fulfilled he would normally have a right to demand that the necessary permission be given usual in these cases on grounds of public concern to vest some public authority with a discretion to grant or refuse such licences and to modify or cancel ones already granted Therefore when Rule speaks of erecting such premises it must be borne in mind that the rule is not a mere building rule affecting the erection of a building in the abstract but applies to a building intended to be used for a particular purpose and the license applied for is not merely for permission to build but also to use structure when erected for a partic ular purpose affecting the public at large and the residents of the locality in particular It says The commissioner shall have power in his absolute dis cretion at any time to cancel or suspend any license granted under these Rules After Rule comes a second sub heading entitled Per formance License and Rules to set out the require ments relating to the holding of performances as distinct from the requirements relating to the building or premises in or on which they are to be held No question of estoppel has been raised here so that is not a question we need consider nor need we answer the converse question whether an estoppel would hold good in the face of a law enacted for the public good on grounds of public policy also whether there can be an estoppel when a person builds knowing the risk he runs of cancellation at any time under Rule The next question is whether an order in the nature of a mandamus can issue under section of the Specific Relief Act The reliefs specifically sought there are an order directing the Commissioner to withdraw the cancellation and or directing him to grant permission for the erec tion of a cinema first it is evident from the rules that there is no specific law which requires the Commission er to grant a license on the fulfillment by the petitioner of certain conditions He is vested with a discretion to grant or to refuse a license and all that the law requires is that he should exercise that discretion in good faith There is no specific law which compels him to forbear from canceling a license once granted in fact that would be an impossibility still less is there any law which compels him to withdraw a cancella tion already effected that would fetter the absolute dis cretion vested in him by Rule It is evident from these facts that the Commissioner had before him objections which called for the exercise of the discretion regarding cancellation specifi cally vested in him by Rule It was objected as to this that there is no specific law which compels him to exercise the discretion There is authority for this point of view but we see no reason for limiting the clear words of the section or for reading into it matter which is not there We can see no reason why statutory duties should be placed on any different plane from other duties enjoined by any other kind of law especially as some The only other point we need consider is whether the applicant has no other specific and adequate legal remedy It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the re spondent could have ignored the so called order of cancella tion if he considered it was of no effect alternatively he had the specific legal remedy of suing for an injunction which could have accorded him adequate relief It may in the end prove to be ineffective as has happened in this case but it would be wrong to expect a person on whom it is served to ignore it at his peril however much he may be legally entitled to do so The respondent had a right to expect the Commissioner to make up his mind and reach a decision otherwise it left him in a state of uncertainty If he commenced to build the Commissioner would have a right to take action under Rule and tell him to stop and at best that would involve the respondent in a long and expensive litigation which he might or might not win We are clear that he had a right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly what he might or might not do so that he could adjust his affairs Each case must necessarily depend on its own facts and we have no intention of laying down any hard and fast rule In any event there are many cases of a similar nature in which section has been applied without objection despite the fact that an injunc tion could have been sought Lastly it was urged that the petition is incompetent because the provisions of section of the Specific Relief Act have not been complied with namely the petitioner has not shown that he made a demand for justice and that it was denied In our opinion there was a substantial demand here and it is clear that there was a denial The only reply to this was I am directed to inform you that Government does not wish to add anything to the reply already given to you
