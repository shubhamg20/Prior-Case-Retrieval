Not only this they instituted frivolous cases and succeeded in persuading <ORG> to pass orders of injunction against the steps taken by banks and financial institutions to recover their dues <ORG> also prepared a draft of the proposed legislation which contained a provision for disposal of cases in three months and conferment of power upon <ORG> for expeditious execution of orders made by adjudicating bodies This is the reason why the DRT Act not only provides for establishment of the <ORG> and the Appellate <ORG> with the jurisdiction powers and authority to make summary adjudication of applications made by banks or financial institutions and specifies the modes of recovery of the amount determined by the <ORG> or the Appellate <ORG> but also bars the jurisdiction of all courts except <ORG> and <ORG> in relation to the matters specified in Section but also for quick resolution of disputes arising out of the action taken for recovery of such dues Both the <ORG> and <NAME> Committees suggested enactment of new legislation for securitisation and empowering the banks and financial institutions to take possession of the securities and sell them without intervention of the court Sub section thereof lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in Sections or A of the Transfer of Property Act any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the intervention of the court or tribunal by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act Sub section of Section enumerates first of many steps needed to be taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security interest This sub section provides that if a borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor makes any default in repayment of secured debt and his account in respect of such debt is classified as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge his liabilities within sixty days from the date of the notice with an indication that if he fails to do so the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of its rights in terms of Section Sub section of Section lays down that notice issued under Section shall contain details of the amount payable by the borrower as also the details of the secured assets intended to be enforced by the bank or financial institution Sub section A of Section lays down that the borrower may make a representation in response to the notice issued under Section and challenge the classification of his account as non performing asset as also the quantum of amount specified in the notice This is subject to the condition that the right to transfer by way of lease etc If the management of whole or part of the business is severable then the secured creditor can take over management only of such business of the borrower which is relatable to security The secured creditor can also by notice in writing call upon a person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower to pay the money which may be sufficient to discharge the liability of the borrower Sub section of Section lays down that where any action has been taken against a borrower under sub section all costs charges and expenses properly incurred by the secured creditor or any expenses incidental thereto can be recovered from the borrower Sub section of Section imposes a restriction on the sale or transfer of the secured asset if the amount due to the secured creditor together with costs charges and expenses incurred by him are tendered at any time before the time fixed for such sale or transfer There are five unnumbered provisos to Section which deal with pari passu charge of the workers of a company in liquidation The first of these provisos lays down that in the case of a company in liquidation the amount realised from the sale of secured assets shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section A of the Companies Act The second proviso deals with the case of a company being wound up on or after the commencement of this Act If the secured creditor of such company opts to realise its security instead of relinquishing the same and proving its debt under Section of the Companies Act then it can retain sale proceeds after depositing the workmen dues with the liquidator in accordance with Section A Sub section of Section lays down that where dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied by the sale proceeds of the secured assets the secured creditor may file an application before the <ORG> under Section for recovery of balance amount from the borrower Sub section of Section lays down that rights available to the secured creditor under the Act may be exercised by one or more of its officers authorised in this behalf In terms of Section the secured creditor can file an application before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction the secured asset or other documents relating thereto are found for taking possession thereof If any such request is made the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate as the case may be is obliged to take possession of such asset or document and forward the same to the secured creditor Section speaks of the remedies available to any person including borrower who may have grievance against the action taken by the secured creditor under sub section of Section Such an aggrieved person can make an application to the <ORG> within days from the date on which action is taken under that sub section Sub section of Section casts a duty on the <ORG> to consider whether the measures taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security interest are in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder If the <ORG> after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence produced by the parties comes to the conclusion that the measures taken by the secured creditor are not in consonance with sub section of Section then it can direct the secured creditor to restore management of the business or possession of the secured assets to the borrower On the other hand if the <ORG> finds that the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of Section is in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor can take recourse to one or more of the measures specified in Section for recovery of its secured debt Sub section of Section prescribes the time limit of sixty days within which an application made under Section is required to be disposed of If the <ORG> fails to decide the application within a maximum period of four months then either party can move the Appellate <ORG> for issue of a direction to the <ORG> to dispose of the application expeditiously Section provides for an appeal to the Appellate <ORG> Section lays down that <ORG> shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which a <ORG> or Appellate <ORG> is empowered to determine It further lays down that no injunction shall be granted by any <ORG> or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken under the SARFAESI Act or the DRT Act It declares that the provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law It is thus to be seen that the question of non recoverable or delayed recovery of debts advanced by the banks or financial institutions has been attracting attention and the matter was considered in depth by the Committees specially constituted consisting of the experts in the field In the prevalent situation where the amounts of dues are huge and hope of early recovery is less it cannot be said that a more effective legislation for the purpose was uncalled for or that it could not be resorted to We are therefore unable to find much substance in the submission made on behalf of the petitioners that while the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act was in operation it was uncalled for to have yet another legislation for the recovery of the mounting dues emphasis supplied This <ORG> then held that the borrower can challenge the action taken under Section by filing an application under Section of the SARFAESI Act and a civil suit can be filed within the narrow scope and on the limited grounds on which they are permissible in the matters relating to an English mortgage enforceable without intervention of the <ORG> In paragraph of the judgment the <ORG> observed as under In view of the discussion held in the judgment and the findings and directions contained in the preceding paragraphs we hold that the borrowers would get a reasonably fair deal and opportunity to get the matter adjudicated upon before <ORG> The effect of some of the provisions may be a bit harsh for some of the borrowers but on that ground the impugned provisions of the Act cannot be said to be unconstitutional in view of the fact that the object of the Act is to achieve speedier recovery of the dues declared as NPAs and better availability of capital liquidity and resources to help in growth of the economy of the country and welfare of the people in general which would subserve the public interest In the light of the above we shall now consider whether <ORG> of <ORG> was justified in restraining the appellant from proceeding under Section of the SARFAESI Act against the property of respondent No After one year and six months the appellant sent letter dated to respondent Nos and pointing out that repayment of loan was highly irregular After another one year the account of respondent No was classified as Non Performing Asset On the appellant sent separate letters to respondent Nos and requiring them to deposit the outstanding dues amounting to Rs Thereupon respondent No deposited a sum of Rs and gave written undertaking to pay the balance amount in instalments Faced with the imminent threat of losing the mortgaged property respondent No filed No of and prayed that the appellant herein may be restrained from taking coercive action in pursuance of the notices issued under Section and and order dated passed by District Magistrate Collector Allahabad She pleaded that the notices issued by the appellant for recovery of the outstanding dues are ex facie illegal and liable to be quashed because no action had been taken against the borrower i respondent No for recovery of the outstanding dues In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant it was pleaded that action initiated against respondent No was consistent with the provisions of SARFAESI Act and writ petitioner respondent No herein was bound to discharge her obligations to pay the outstanding dues and there was no merit in her challenge to the notices issued under Section and or the order passed under Section The reason which prompted <ORG> to pass the impugned interim order and operative portion thereof are extracted below Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that the loan was taken by respondent No for opening a colour lab at Raj Complex Kakkar Road Allahabad but the loan has not been repaid by respondent No and the bank is proceeding against the petitioner who is the guarantor of the loan It is not clear from the documents produced by learned counsel for the bank as to what steps have been taken by the bank against the borrower of the loan and merely issuance of notice under section of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act against the borrower is not sufficient However if any possession has been taken by the bank then the property shall not be sold to any one else and the petitioner shall be continued in possession of the property We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and perused the record Normally this Court does not interfere with the discretion exercised by <ORG> to pass an interim order in a pending matter but having carefully examined the matter we have felt persuaded to make an exception in this case because the order under challenge has the effect of defeating the very object of the legislation enacted by the <ORG> for ensuring that there are no unwarranted impediments in the recovery of the debts etc The question whether the appellant could have issued notices to respondent No under Section and and filed an application under Section of the SARFAESI Act without first initiating action against the borrower i respondent No for recovery of the outstanding dues is no longer res integra On such payment he will be subrogated to the rights of the creditor under Section of the Indian Contract Act and he may then recover the amount from the principal There is nothing in law which provides such a composite decree to be first executed only against the principal debtor In view of the law laid down in the aforementioned cases it must be held that <ORG> completely misdirected itself in assuming that the appellant could not have initiated action against respondent No without making efforts for recovery of its dues from the borrower respondent No The facts of the present case show that even after receipt of notices under Section and and order passed under Section of the SARFAESI Act respondent Nos and did not bother to pay the outstanding dues Therefore the action taken by the appellant for recovery of its dues by issuing notices under Section and and by filing an application under Section cannot be faulted on any legally permissible ground and in our view <ORG> of <ORG> committed serious error by entertaining the writ petition of respondent No There is another reason why the impugned order should be set aside If respondent No had any tangible grievance against the notice issued under Section or action taken under Section then she could have availed remedy by filing an application under Section The expression any person used in Section is of wide import It takes within its fold not only the borrower but also guarantor or any other person who may be affected by the action taken under Section or Section Both the <ORG> and the Appellate <ORG> are empowered to pass interim orders under Sections and and are required to decide the matters within a fixed time schedule Unfortunately <ORG> overlooked the settled law that <ORG> will ordinarily not entertain a petition under Article of the Constitution if an effective remedy is available to the aggrieved person and that this rule applies with greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes cess fees other types of public money and the dues of banks and other financial institutions In our view while dealing with the petitions involving challenge to the action taken for recovery of the public dues etc <ORG> must keep in mind that the legislations enacted by <ORG> and <ORG> Legislatures for recovery of such dues are code unto themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensive procedure for recovery of the dues but also envisage constitution of quasi judicial bodies for redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved person Therefore in all such cases <ORG> must insist that before availing remedy under Article of the Constitution a person must exhaust the remedies available under the relevant statute While expressing the aforesaid view we are conscious that the powers conferred upon <ORG> under Article of the Constitution to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> directions orders or writs including the five prerogative writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose are very wide and there is no express limitation on exercise of that power but at the same time we cannot be oblivious of the rules of self imposed restraint evolved by this Court which <ORG> is bound to keep in view while exercising power under Article of the Constitution It is true that the rule of exhaustion of alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion but it is difficult to fathom any reason why <ORG> should entertain a petition filed under Article of the Constitution and pass interim order ignoring the fact that the petitioner can avail effective alternative remedy by filing application appeal revision etc Ordinarily the Court will not entertain a petition for a writ under Article where the petitioner has an alternative remedy which without being unduly onerous provides an equally efficacious remedy <ORG> does not therefore act as a court of appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal to correct errors of fact and does not by assuming jurisdiction under Article trench upon an alternative remedy provided by statute for obtaining relief The petitioners have the right to prefer an appeal before <ORG> under sub section of Section of the Act The Act provides for a complete machinery to challenge an order of assessment and the impugned orders of assessment can only be challenged by the mode prescribed by the Act and not by a petition under Article of the Constitution It is now well recognised that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of This rule was stated with great clarity by <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> in the following passage There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon statute But there is a third class viz where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it the remedy provided by the statute must be followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class But then the Court must have good and sufficient reason to bypass the alternative remedy provided by statute We can also take judicial notice of the fact that the vast majority of the petitions under Article of the Constitution are filed solely for the purpose of obtaining interim orders and thereafter prolong the proceedings by one device or the other The Act has been enacted with a view to provide a special procedure for recovery of debts due to the banks and the financial institutions Even though a provision under an Act cannot expressly oust the jurisdiction of the court under Articles and of the Constitution nevertheless when there is an alternative remedy available judicial prudence demands that the Court refrains from exercising its jurisdiction under the said constitutional provisions This was a case where <ORG> should not have entertained the petition under Article of the Constitution and should have directed the respondent to take recourse to the appeal mechanism provided by the Act the Court reversed an order passed by the Division Bench of Orissa High Court quashing the show cause notice issued to the respondent under the Orissa Sales Tax Act by observing that <ORG> had completely ignored the parameters laid down by this Court in a large number of cases relating to exhaustion of alternative remedy In our opinion <ORG> while exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution is duty bound to take all the relevant facts and circumstances into consideration and decide for itself even in the absence of proper affidavits from the <ORG> and its instrumentalities as to whether any case at all is made out requiring its interference on the basis of the material made available on record There is nothing like issuing an ex parte writ of mandamus order or direction in a public law remedy The <ORG> while exercising its jurisdiction under Article is duty bound to consider whether a adjudication of writ petition involves any complex and disputed questions of facts and whether they can be satisfactorily resolved the petition reveals all material facts the petitioner has any alternative or effective remedy for the resolution of the dispute person invoking the jurisdiction is guilty of unexplained delay and laches ex facie barred by any laws of limitation grant of relief is against public policy or barred by any valid law and host of other factors Insofar as this case is concerned we are convinced that <ORG> was not at all justified in injuncting the appellant from taking action in furtherance of notice issued under Section of the Act In the result the appeal is allowed and the impugned order is set aside Since the respondent has not appeared to contest the appeal the costs are made easy
