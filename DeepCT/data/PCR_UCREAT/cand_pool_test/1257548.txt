State filed an appeal challenging the acquittal and the convicted persons filed another appeal Sentence of imprisonment for life was awarded to all the convicts We have before us two appeals by special leave one jointly filed by <NAME> and <NAME> and the other separately filed by <NAME> Learned sessions Judge found the evidence of <NAME> PW quits acceptable and hence the conviction was based on his testimony Learned judges expressed the view that sessions judge has given undue importance to certain discrepancies and contradictions noted in their evidence When cross examined PW was asked this omission and he had no explanation to offer No doubt <ORG> has full power to review the evidence and to arrive at its own independent conclusion whether the appeal is against conviction or acquittal But while dealing with an appeal against acquittal the appellate court has to bear in mind first that there is a general presumption in favour of the ignorance of the person accused in criminal cases that presumption is only strengthened by the acquittal He would retain that benefit in the appellate court also Thus appellate court in appeals against acquittals has to proceed more cautiously and only if there is absolute assurance of the guilt of the accused upon the evidence on record that the order of acquittal is liable to the interfered with or disturbed Trial court which relied on the evidence of <NAME> PW pointed out that the witness did not refer to any role played by <NAME> when he gave statement to the police during investigation and hence a conviction for the offence of murder cannot be passed against <NAME> on the strength of improvement made at the trial We agree with the findings recorded by the courts below and are of the opinion that their conviction and sentence are well merited There is no merit in their appeal
