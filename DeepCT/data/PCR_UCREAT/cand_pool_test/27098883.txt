Constitution of India Article A Inherent jurisdiction under Articles and to withdraw or transfer and finally dispose of the main suits and pending Criminal proceedings in the course of hearing of appeals arising out of interlocutory orders in suits Whether taken away by Article A Words Cause or matter appearing in Article Meaning and scope of <ORG> power to quash criminal proceedings <ORG> order recording settlement between parties Such agreement if opposed to public poli cy Whether void and order of settlement liable to be set aside Special leave jurisdiction Nature and scope of Main object To meet ends of justice Even specific provision for appeal under the Constitution of other laws not to limit the jurisdiction Stifling of prosecution doctrine Whether attracted where the motive is to drop Criminal as also Civil proceedings Doctrine of restitution Whether applicable to appeals under Article Conferment of immunity from criminal proceedings Whether legislative function Whether amounts to preferential treatment Settlement of claims recorded Review of Whether settlement could be set aside on ground of insufficiency of settlement fund In the event of funds being found insufficient to meet the compensation determined Whether <ORG> as Welfare <ORG> to make good the deficiency On the nd December night there was escape of MIC from the tanks in which it was stored It was also contended that the orders quashing the criminal proceedings which were serious non compoundable offences would not amount to with drawal of the prosecution even under the inherent powers of this <ORG> either under Section Cr The settlement was also assailed on the ground that Fairness Hearing procedure was not followed that the quantum was inadequate and that there was no re opener clause which was very essential in view of the fact that the latency period for the manifestation of the effects of the toxic injuries was unpredictable It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that though it did not dispute the set tlement it was not precluded from pointing out the circum stances in the case which if accepted would detract from the legal validity of the settlement Under Article of the Constitution this <ORG> did have the jurisdiction to withdraw to itself the original suits pending in the District <ORG> at Bhopal and dispose of the same in terms of the settlement So also this <ORG> has the jurisdiction to withdraw the criminal proceedings Article vests in the Supreme <ORG> a plenary Jurisdiction in the matter of entertaining and hearing of appeals by granting special leave against any kind of judgment or order made by a <ORG> or <ORG> in any cause or matter and the powers can be exercised inspite of the limitations under the specific provisions for appeal contained In the Constitution or other laws The powers given by Article are however in the nature of special or residuary powers which are exercisable outside the pur view of the ordinary laws In cases where the needs of jus tice demand Interference by the Supreme <ORG> Under Order of Supreme <ORG> Rules Order XXIII Rule CPC is not one of the rules expressly invoked and made applicable The power under Article is exercised with the aid of the principles of Section CPC which enables withdrawal of prosecutions But whether on the merits there were justifiable grounds to quash the criminal proceedings is a different matter Since there is no specific ground for withdrawal of the prosecutions set out at that stage the quashing of the prosecutions requires to be set aside However In view of this <ORG> finding that the quashing of criminal proceedings was not Justified and that the orders dated th and th of February In that behalf require to be reviewed and set aside as a logical corollary and consequence thereof it is directed that all portions In the orders of this <ORG> which relate to the incompetence of any future prosecutions be deleted Where there is also a pre existing civil liability the dropping of criminal proceedings need not necessarily be a consideration for the agreement to satisfy that liability There is always an inherent jurisdiction to order restitution a fortiorari where a party has acted on the faith of an order of the court Both on principle and authority it becomes the duty of the court to as much moral as it is legal to order refund and restitution of the amount to the <ORG> if the settlement is set aside But this right to have the restitution shall be strictly subject to the condition that the <ORG> shall restore its undertaking dated which was recorded on by the District <ORG> at Bhopal and on the strength of which the court vacated the order of injunction earlier granted against the <ORG> Where there is violation of natural justice no resultant or independent prejudice need be shown as the denial of natural justice is in itself sufficient preju dice and it is no answer to say that even with observance of natural justice the same conclusion would have been reached In <NAME> case this <ORG> held that there was no compliance with the principles of natural justice but also held that the result of the non compliance should not be a mechanical invalidation It cannot be said to have gone beyond the pale of the enquiry when it considered the further question as to the different ways in which that obligation could be complied with or satisfied What was transacted with the court assistance between the <ORG> on one side and the <ORG> on the other is now sought to be made binding on the tens of thou sands of innocent victims who as the law has now declared had a right to be heard before the settlement could be reached or approved It is yet to be decided if the matter goes to trial In the context of the problems presented by the issues of liability in cases of certain corporate torts beyond the corporate veil there is an impressive body of academic opinion amongst the schoolmen that the very theories of limited corporate liability which initially served as incentives for commer cial risk taking needs re thinking in certain areas of tortious liability of Corporations The settlement cannot be as sailed as violative of <ORG> principle which might have arisen for consideration in a strict adjudication In the matter of determination of compensation also under the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Processing of Claims Act and the Scheme framed thereunder there is no scope for applying the said principle inasmuch as the tort feasor in terms of the settlement for all practical purposes stands notionally substituted by the settlement fund which now represents and exhausts the liability of the alleged hazardous entrepreneurs viz Con tingencies such as payment of compensation to the persons who were exposed to the Bhopal gas disaster who though presently asymptomatic and filed no claim for compensation but might become symptomatic in future and the yet unborn children of mothers exposed to MIC toxicity who may develop congenital defects shall be taken care of by obtaining an appropriate medical group insurance cover from <ORG> or <ORG> of India There is need for expeditious adjudication and disposal of the claims The fact that the <ORG> has taken over the right to sue on behalf of all the victims indicates that if there is a shortfall in the Fund perhaps it would be the liability of <ORG> to meet the same If the litigation was to go on merits in the Bhopal <ORG> it would have perhaps taken at least to years an appeal to the High <ORG> and a further appeal to this <ORG> would have taken in all around another spell of years with steps for expedition taken In the event of <ORG>s taking the view that strict liability was foreign to the American jurisprudence and contrary to public policy the decree would not have been executed in the United <ORG>s and apart from the Indian assets of <ORG> there would have been no scope for satisfaction of the decree It would be wrong to assume that there is an element of judicial arrogance in the act of the <ORG> when it proceeds to act in a pragmatic way to protect the victims Supposing a pre decisional hearing was afforded to the victims the <ORG> option obviously would have been either to approve the terms of the compromise or to refuse to superadd its seal to the settlement and leave the parties to go to trial It could not have unilaterally imposed any additional liability on any of the contracting parties In the early hours of the rd of December there was a massive escape of lethal gas from the MIC Stor age Tank of the plant into the atmosphere which led to the calamity The foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant In the plaint it was stated that death toll upto then was and serious injuries had been suffered by several thousand persons and in all more than lakh persons had sought damages upto then It is in these cases that the matter was settled by two orders dated th and th of February I do not intend to indicate that the claims filed later are frivolous particu larly on account of the fact that there are contentions and some prima facie materials to show that the iII effects of exposure to MIC could manifest late The fact that <ORG> has taken over the right to sue on behalf of all the victims indicates that if there is a shortfall in the Fund perhaps it would be the liability of <ORG> to meet the same This <ORG> in paragraph of the <NAME> judgment said The Rule of <NAME> <NAME> was evolved in the year and it provides that a person who for his own purposes brings on to his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes must keep it at his peril and if he fails to do so is prima facie liable for the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape The liability under this rule is strict and it is no defence that the thing escaped without that person wilful act default or neglect or even that he had no knowledge of its existence This rule laid down a principle of liability that if a person who brings on to his land and collects and keep there anything likely to do harm and such thing escapes and does damage to another he is liable to compensate for the damage caused Of course this rule applies only to non natural user of the land and it does not apply to things naturally on the land or where the escape is due to an act of God and an act of a stranger or the default of the person injured or where the thing which escapes is present by the consent of the person injured or in certain cases where there is statutory authority But it is not necessary for us to consider these decisions laying down the parame ters of this rule because in a modern industrial society with highly developed scientific knowledge and technology where hazardous or inherently dangerous industries are necessary to carry as part of the developmental programme this rule evolved in the th century at a time when all these developments of science and technology had not taken place cannot afford any guidance in evolving any standard of liability consistent with the conStitutional norms and the needs of the present day economy and social structure Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country We are certainly prepared to receive light from whatever source it comes but we have to build our own jurisprudence and we cannot countenance an argument that merely because the law in England does not recognise the rule of strict and absolute liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous activities or the rule laid down in <NAME> <NAME> as developed in England recognises certain limitations and excep tions we in India must hold back our hands and not venture to evolve a new principle of liability since English courts have not done so We have to develop our own law and if we find that it is necessary to construct a new principle of liability to deal with an unusual situation which has arisen and which is likely to arise in future on account of hazard ous or inherently dangerous industries which are concommi tant to an industrial economy there is no reason why we should hesitate to evolve such principle of liabili ty merely because it has not been so done in England We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a haz ardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non delegable duty to the commu nity to ensure that no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity which it has undertaken The enterprise must be held to be under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity the enterprise must be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it should be no answer to the enterprise to say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without any negligence on its part We are not concerned in the present case as to whether the ratio of <ORG> should be applied to cases of the type referred to in it in India If the litigation was to go on on merits in <ORG> it would have perhaps taken at least to years an appeal to <ORG> and a further appeal to this Court would have taken in all around another spell of years with steps for expedition taken From the year when the suit was instituted that would have taken us to the beginning of the next century and then steps would have been made for its execution in the United States It would be wrong to assume that there is an element of judicial arrogance in the act of the <ORG> when it proceeds to act in a pragmatic way to protect the victims Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Director of Public Prosecu tions All said I entertain no doubt that there remains in the courts of law a residual power to enforce the supreme and fundamental purpose of the law to conserve not only the safety and order but also the moral welfare of the <ORG> When an inter locutory matter pertaining to the in terim compensation came up for hearing there was a <ORG> assisted settlement of the main suit claim itself at Million Dollars recorded by he orders of this <ORG> dated th and th of February The petitions also raise questions as to the jurisdiction and powers of the <ORG> to sanction and record such settlement when appeals brought up against an inter locutory order were alone before this court Judge <NAME> adopting the suggested approach in <NAME> decision that doctrine of forum non conveniens was desinged in part to help courts in avoiding complex exercises in comparative laws and that the decision should not hinge on an unfavour able change in law which was lot a major factor in the analysis was persuaded to the view that differences in the system did not establish inadequacy of the alternative forum in India The contention of the <ORG> was that in a suit for damages where the basis of the liability was disputed the Court had no power to make an award of interim compensation It was urged that in common law and that the law of India too in a suit for damages no court could award interim compensation In <NAME> Assignment Courier All ER CA it was recog nised that there was no such power in common law It raises issues of social economic and financial policy not amenable to judicial reform which will almost certainly prove to be controversial and can be resolved by the legislature only after full consideration of factors which cannot be brought into clear focus or be weighed and assessed in the course of the forensic proc ess The relevant portions of the order of this <ORG> dated th February provide <ORG> shall pay a sum of Dollars millions Four hundred and seventy Millions to <ORG> in full settlement of all claims rights and liabilities related to and arising out of the Bhopal Gas disaster Upon full payment in accordance with the <ORG> directions the undertaking given by <ORG> pursuant to the order dated November in the District <ORG> Bhopal stands discharged and all orders passed in Suit No of and or in any Revision therefrom also stand discharged Upon full payment of the sum referred to in paragraph above a <ORG> and the State of Madhya Pradesh shall take all steps which may in future become necessary in order to implement and give effect to this order including but not limited to ensuring that any suits claims or civil or criminal complaints which may be filed in future against any <ORG> Company or person referred to in this settle ment are defended by them and disposed of in terms of this order Any such suits claims or civil or crimi nal proceedings filed or to be filed before any court or authority are hereby enjoined and shall not be proceeded with before such court or authority except for dismissal of quashing in terms of this order Upon full payment in accordance with the <ORG> directions a The undertaking given by <ORG> pursuant to the order dated November in <ORG> Bhopal shall stand discharged and all orders passed in Suit No of and or in revision therefrom shall also stand discharged As to the remaining question it has been said that many vital juristic principles of great contemporary relevance to the Third World generally and to India in partic ular touching problems emerging from the pursuit of such dangerous technologies for economic gains by multi nationals arose in this case The second event is that on th of November <ORG> at Bhopal on the motion of the plaintiff <ORG> made an order restraining the <ORG> by an interlocutory injunction from selling its assets paying dividends buying back debts etc The petitioners urge that even after setting aside of the settlement there is no compulsion or obligation to restore to the <ORG> the amounts brought into <ORG> by it as such a step would prejudicially affect the interests of the victims The other cognate question is whether if <ORG> is held entitled to such resti tution should it not as a pre condition be held to be under a corresponding obligation to restore and effectuate its prior undertaking dated th November to maintain unencumbered assets of three billion Dollars accepting which the order dated th November of <ORG> Bhopal came to be made Learned Attorney General submitted that the factum of compromise or settlement re corded in the orders dated th th of February is not disputed by <ORG> The orders of the <ORG> dated th and th of February in so far as they pertain to the quashing of criminal proceedings are without jurisdiction Contention The termination of the pending criminal proceedings brought about by the orders dated th and th of Febru ary is bad in law and would require to be reviewed and set aside on grounds that i if the orders are con strued as permitting a compounding of offences they run in the teeth of the statutory prohibition contained in Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure ii if the orders are construed as permitting a withdrawal of the prosecution under Section In concluding that the settlement was just and reasonable the <ORG> omitted to take into account and provide for certain important heads of compensation such as the need for and the costs of medical surveillance of a large section of population which though asymptomatic for the present was likely to become symptomatic later having regard to the character and the potentiality of the risks of exposure and the likely future damages resulting from long term effects and to build in a re opener clause There were no criteria to go by at all to decide the fairness and adequacy of the settlement Contention Even if the settlement is reviewed and set aside there is no compulsion or obliga tion to refund and restore to the <ORG> the funds brought in by it as such restitution is discretionary and in exercising this discre tion the interests of the victims be kept in mind and restitution denied Contention I Notice to the affected person implicit in section of the Act was imperative before reaching a settlement and that as admittedly no such opportunity was given to the affected person either by <ORG> before entering into the settlement or by the <ORG> before approving it the settlement is void as violative of natural justice The contention articulated with strong emphasis is that the court had no jurisdiction to withdraw and dispose of the main suits and the criminal proceedings in the course of hearing of appeals arising out of an interlocutory order in the suits The disposal of the suits would require and imply their transfer and withdrawal to this court for which it is contended the <ORG> had no power under law It is urged that there is no power to withdraw the suits or pro ceedings dehors The powers given by Article are however in the nature special or resid uary powers which are exercisable outside the purview of the ordinary laws in cases where the needs of justice demand interference <ORG> Article of the Constitution provides <ORG> in exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it and any decree so passed or order so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed by or under any law made by <ORG> and until provision in that behalf is so made in such manner as the President may by order prescribe In Halsbury Laws of England Fourth Edition vol para referring to the plenitude of that expression it is stated Cause or matter The words cause and matter are often used in juxtaposition but they have different meanings To the extent power of withdrawal and transfer of cases to the apex court is in the opinion of the <ORG> necessary for the purpose of effectuating the high purpose of Articles and the power under Article A must be held not to exhaust the power of withdrawal and transfer That article enables the litigants to approach <ORG> for transfer of proceedings if the conditions envisaged in that Article are satisfied We find absolutely no merit in this hypertechnical submission of the petitioners learned counsel We reject the argument as unsound Before granting such leave the <ORG> shall give notice in such manner as it may think fit to such persons as may appear to it to be interested in the suit The observations in <NAME> case relied in this behalf are these However Order XX Rule of the Code is an important and significant pointer and the principles behind the said provision would apply to this case the said rule provides that no agreement or compromise in a represen tative suit shall be entered into without the leave of the <ORG> expressly recorded in the proceedings and sub rule of rule enjoins that before granting such leave the <ORG> shall give notice in such manner as it may think fit in a representative action We have given our careful consideration to this submission If it is the latter as indeed the <NAME> case has held the contention in substance is not different from the one based on non compliance with the right of being heard which has been read into Section Dealing with that the <NAME> case having regard to the circumstances of the case declined to push the effect of non compliance to its logical conclusion and declare the settlement void Incidentally there are certain observations implying an opportunity of being heard also before the <ORG> Section CPC biter alia says that nothing contained in that Code shall be deemed to affect the powers of the Supreme <ORG> under Article or any other provision of the Constitution or to interfere with any rules made by the Supreme <ORG> Under Order of the Supreme <ORG> Rules Order XXIII Rule CPC is not one of the rules expressly invoked and made applicable They are inapplicable to orders made by a court of unlimited jurisdiction in the course of contentious litigation If it is irregular it can be set aside by the court that made it on application to that court if it is regular it can only be set aside by an appellate court on appeal if there is one to which appeal lies With reference to the void cases <ORG> ob served The cases that are referred to in these dicta do not support the proposition that there is any category or orders of a court of unlimited jurisdiction of this kind what they do sup port is the quite different proposition that there is a category of orders of such a court which a person affected by the order is enti tled to apply to have set aside ex debito justitiae in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court without his needing to have recourse to the rules that deal ex pressly with proceedings to set aside orders for irregularity and give to the judge a discretion as to the order he will make This concerns the validity of that part of the orders of the th and th of February quashing and terminating the criminal proceedings Para of the order dated th February reads Upon full payment of the sum referred to in paragraph above a <ORG> and the State of Madhya Pradesh shall take all steps which may in future become necessary in order to implement and give effect to this order including but not limited to ensuring that any suits claims or civil or criminal complaints which may be filed in future against any <ORG> Company or person referred to in this settle ment are defended by them and disposed of in terms of this order Petitioners learned counsel strenuously contend that the orders of th and th of February quashing the pending criminal proceedings which were serious non compoundable offences under Sections etc <NAME> also referred to the <NAME> case where this Court having regard to the large issues of public interest involved in the matter conferred the power of adjudication of claims exclusively on one forum irrespec tive of jurisdictional prescriptions Learned Attorney General submitted that the matter had been placed beyond doubt in <NAME> case where the court had invoked and applied the dictum in <NAME> case to a situation where the invalidity of a judicial direction which was contrary to the statutory provision namely section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and as such violative of Article of the Constitution was raised and the court held that such a direction was invalid There were only procedural and terminolog ical departures and <ORG> as a party inviting the order could not according to <NAME> challenge the jurisdiction to make it We agree with <NAME> that the power of the <ORG> under Article in so far as quashing of criminal proceedings are concerned is not exhausted by Sections or or Cr That would convey the idea that statutory provisions override a constitutional provision There is some justification to say that statutory prohibition against compounding of certain class of serious offences in which larger social interests and social security are in volved is based on broader and fundamental considerations of public policy But <NAME> put it effectively when he said that if the position in relation to the criminal cases was that the court was invited by <ORG> to permit the termi nation of the prosecution and the court consented to it and quashed the criminal cases it could not be said that there was some prohibition in some law for such powers being exercised under Article Essentially it was a matter of mere form and procedure and not of substance The power under Article is exercised with the aid of the principles of Section We cannot accept the position urged by the learned Attor ney General and learned counsel for the petitioners that court had no power or jurisdiction to make that order But whether on the merits there were justifiable grounds to quash is a different matter Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the case involved the allegation of commission of serious of fences in the investigation of which the society was vitally interested and that considerations of public interest instead of supporting a withdrawal indicate the very oppo site There is however one aspect on which we should pronounce The settlement which took place on The th of February it is alleged was intended to circumvent that inspection we have gone through the correspondence on the point The order dated th February provides in clause a and that any suits claims or civil or crimi nal complaints which may be filed in future against any <ORG> Company or person referred to in this settlement are defended by them and disposed of in terms of this order There is no power or jurisdiction in the courts says learned Attorney General to confer immunity for criminal prosecution and punishment The decisive question then is whether the district attorney and the district court in New Mexico absent constitutional provision or enabling statute conferring the power are authorized to grant immunity from prosecution for an offense to which incrimi nating answers provoked by questions asked will expose the witness Learned Attorney General referred us to the following passage in Jurisprudence by <NAME> Again if we say that has an immunity from arrest when a sitting member of <ORG> then during its subsistence he has an immunity that is denied to the generality of citizens there is an inequality of rights and duties of citizens when the immunity is made out Following observations of Justice <NAME> in his Commen taries in the Constitution of United States were referred to There are incidental powers belonging to the executive department which are necessarily implied from the nature of the functions which are confided to it But the question does not strictly arise in that sense in the present case However in view of our finding on contention that the quashing of criminal proceedings was not justified and that the orders dated th and th of February in that behalf require to be reviewed and set aside the present contention does not survive because as a logical corollary and consequence of such further directions as to future prosecutions earlier require to be deleted there is not a single case in which an estoppel has been allowed in such a case to defeat a statutory obli gation of an unconditional character SCR at where this court repelled the contention that an agreement on the part of the Govern ment not to acquire for a period of years the lands of the company did not prevent the <ORG> from enacting or giving effect to a legislation for acquisition and that the surren der by the Government of its legislative powers which are intended to be used for public good cannot avail the company or operate against the Government as equitable estoppel Indeed in <ORG> <ORG> Ch at <ORG> said it seems to me that the clear result of the authorities is that notwithstanding the consent order has been drawn up and completed and acted upon to the extent that the property has been sold and the money has been paid into the hands of the receiver I may now set aside tile order and arrangement upon any ground which would justify me in setting aside an agreement entered into between the parties The real truth of the matter is that the order is a mere creature of the agreement and to say that the <ORG> can set aside the agreement and it was not disputed that this could be done if a common mistake were proved but that it cannot set aside an order which was the creature of that agreement seems to me to be giving the branch an existence which is independent of the tree in the following words the appellants contend that there is no jurisdiction to set aside the consent order upon such materials as we have to deal with and they go so far as to say that a consent order can only be set aside on the ground of fraud I have not the slightest doubt on that nor have I the slightest doubt that a consent order can be impeached not only on the ground of fraud but upon any grounds which invalidate the agreement it expresses in a more formal way than usual <NAME> urged that there were certain funda mental misconceptions about the scope of this doctrine of stifling of prosecution in the arguments of the petitioners He submitted that the true principle was that while non compoundable offences which are matter of public concern cannot be subject matter of private bargains and that admin istration of criminal justice should not be allowed to pass from the hands of Judges to private individuals the doc trine is not attracted where side by side with criminal liability there was a pre existing civil liability that was also settled and satisfied The questions that arise in the present case are first whether putting an end to the criminal proceedings was a part of the consideration and bargain for the payment of million US dollars or whether it was merely one of the motives for entering into the settlement and secondly whether the memorandum of settlement and orders of this court properly construed amount to a compounding of the offences Ch at said We have therefore a ease in which a contract is entered into for the purpose of diverting I may say perverting the course of justice and although I agree that in this ease it was entered into with perfect good faith and with all the security which could possibly be given to such an agreement I nevertheless think that the general principle applies and that we cannot give effect to the agreement the consideration of which is the diverting the course of public justice It seems clear from the various authorities brought before us on the argument that some misdemeanours are of such a nature that a contract to withdraw a prosecution in respect of them and to consent to give no evidence against the parties accused is founded on an illegal consideration The first respondent who had filed a criminal complaint in the Magis trate Court against the appellant and his other partners alleging of commission of offences under Sections and read with Sections of the Indian Penal Code entered into an agreement with the accused persons under which the dispute between the appellant and the first respondent and others was to be referred to arbitration on the first respondent agreeing to withdraw his criminal complaint The arbitration proceedings the consideration for which was the withdrawal of the complaint culminated in an award and the first respondent applied to have the award made a rule of the court In <NAME> <NAME> AIR Calcutta <ORG> said Now in order to show that the object of the Agreement was to stifle criminal prosecution it is necessary to prove that there was an agreement between the parties express or implied the consideration for which was to take the administration of law out of the hands of the Judges and put it into the hands of a private individual to determine what is to be done hi particular case and that the contracting parties should enter into a bar gain to that effect In that case this court further held that the doctrine applies when as a consideration for not proceeding with a criminal complaint an agreement is made in substance it really means that the complainant has taken upon himself to deal with his com plaint and on the bargaming counter he has used his non prosecution of the complaint as a consideration for the agreement which his opponent has been induced or coerced to enter into Where there is also a pre existing civil liability the dropping of criminal proceedings need not necessarily be a consideration for the agreement to satisfy that liability AIR Patna this distinc tion is pointed out The distinction between the motive for coming to an agreement and the actual consideration for the agreement must be kept carefully in view and this care must be particularly exer cised in a case where there is a civil liabil ity already existing which is discharged or remitted by the Agreement These decisions are based upon the facts of the cases showing clearly that the agreements or the contracts sought to be enforced were the foundation for the withdrawal of non compoundable criminal cases and were declared to be unlawful on the ground of public policy wholly void in law and therefore unenforce able This class of cases has no application where as in the present case there was a pre existing civil liability based upon ad justment of accounts between the parties concerned AIR Oudh this distinction has been pointed out Though the motive of the execution of the document may be the withdrawal of a non compoundable criminal case the considera tion is quite legal provided there is an enforceable preexisting liability In the Patna case it was observed that the distinc tion between the motive for coming to an agreement and the actual consideration for the agreement must be kept care fully in view and this care must be particu larly exercised in a case where there is a civil liability already existing which is discharged or remitted by the agreement Accordingly on Contention we hold that the settlement is not hit by Section or of the Indian Contract Act and that no part of the consideration for payment of million US dollars was unlawful It is also urged that the quantum settled for is hopelessly inadequate as the settlement has not envisaged and provided for many heads of compensation such as the future medical surveillance costs of a large section of the exposed population which is put at risk and that Ihc toxic tort actions where the latency period for the manifestation of the effects of the exposure is unpredictable it is neces sary to have a re opener clause as in the very nature of toxic injuries the latency period for the manifestation of effects is unpredictable and any structured settlement should contemplate and provide for the possible baneful contingencies of the future On the first aspect Sri <NAME> however contends that the possibility that the exposed population might develop hitherto unsuspected complications in the future was known to and was in the mind of <ORG> and it must be presumed to have taken all the possi bilities into account in arriving at the settlement Indeed in the plains in <ORG> Shri <NAME> points out <ORG> has specifically averred that there were possibilities of such future damage We may at this stage have a brief look at the work of the medical evaluation and categorisation of the Health Status of the affected persons carried out by <ORG> There is no doubt that such a remedy would permit the early detection and treatment of maladies and that as a matter of public policy the tort feasor should bear its cost Two actions therefore will not lie against the same defendant for personal injury sustained in the same accident But petitioners say that in the process of evolving what is a fair reasonable and adequate settlement some of the elements essential and relevant to fairness and adequacy such as provision for future medical surveillance and the likely future but yet unforeseen manifestation of toxic injury having regard to the nature of the hazard have not been kept in mind and therefore the approval accorded to the settlement is on an incomplete criteria <NAME> referred to certain passages in the report of Chief Judge <NAME> in what is known as the Agent Orange Litigation Federal Supplement to indicate what according to her are the criteria a <ORG> has to keep in mind in approving a settlement It is not a case of one having common interest with others Parties would be hesitant to ex plore the likelihood of settlement apprehen sive as they would then be that the applica tion for approval would necessarily result in a judicial determination that there was no escape from liability or no hope of recovery and thus no basis for a compromise Sri <NAME> also pointed out that In Agent Orange set tlement only a small fraction of one percent of the class Came forward at the fairness hearings that there was no medical evidence nor a mini trial about the factual aspects of the case and that in the end the silent majority re mains inscrutable But there is one aspect as to medical surveillance costs and as to a provision for possible cases which are now a sympto matic and which may become symptomatic after a drawn out of latency period We will discuss that aspect under Point infra We propose to decide it though the stage for giving effect to it has not yet arrived It is submitted that in view of the facts and circumstances of the case the previous history of the litigation the orders passed by the district court Bhopal <ORG> and <ORG> and the undertakings given by <ORG> and <ORG> to <ORG> in respect of their assets <ORG> may in order to do complete justice under Article of the constitution require retention of the moneys for such period as it may deem fit in order to satisfy any decree that may be passed in the suit including the enforceable order of <ORG> dated th April It is urged by the learned Attorney General that restitution being in the nature of a proceedings inexecu tion the party claiming that benefit must be relegated to the court of first instance to work out its remedies We are not impressed by any of these contentions There is always an inherent jurisdiction to order restitution a fortiorari where a party has acted on the faith of an order of the court Both on principle and authority it becomes the duty of the court to as much moral as it is legal to order refund and restitution of the amount to the UCC if the settlement is set aside It shall place the appli cant in the position in which he would have been if the order had not made and for this purpose the <ORG> is armed with powers the may is empowering not discretionary as to mesne profits interest and so forth lay down a procedure where effect can be given to that general provision of the law But this right to have the restitution shall be strictly subject to the condition that the <ORG> shall restore its undertaking dated which was recorded on by <ORG> at Bhopal and on the strength of which the court vacated the order of injunction earlier granted against the <ORG> He referred to and relied upon the following observations of Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case It has been canvassed on behalf of the vic tims that the Code of Civil Procedure is an instant example of what is a just fair and reasonable procedure at least the principles embodied therein and the Act would be unrea sonable if there is exclusion of the victims to vindicate properly their views and rights In any case it has been suggested and in our opinion there is a good deal of force in this contention that if a part of the claim for good reasons or bad is sought to be compromised or adjusted without at least considering the views of the victims that would be unreasonable deprivation of the rights of the victims Right to a hearing or repre sentation before entering into a compromise seems to be embodied in the due process of law understood in the sense the term has been used in the constitutional jargon of this country though perhaps not originally intended of the Act meaningful and effective it should be so read that the victims have to be given an opportunity of the making their representation before the court comes to any conclusion in respect of any settlement In our opinion the constitutional require ments the language of the section the pur pose of the Act and the principles of natural justice lead us to this interpretation of section of the Act that in case of a pro posed or contemplated settlement notice should be given to the victims who ace affect ed or whose rights are to be affected to ascertain their views But after making the observation excerpted above <ORG> having regard to the nature of this litigation proceeded to spell out its views and conclusions on the effect of non compliance of natural justice and whether there were other remedial and curative exercise Yet in the par ticular situations one has to bear in mind how an infraction of that should be sought to be removed in accordance with justice Where there is violation of natural justice no resultant or independent prejudice need be shown as the denial of natural justice is in itself sufficient preju dice and it is no answer to say that even with observance of natural justice the same conclusion would have been reached <NAME> for holding administrative acts to be voidable where ac cording to principle they are void may be a desire to extend the discretionary powers of the <ORG> It cannot be said to have gone beyond the pale of the enquiry when it considered the further question as to the different ways in which that obligation could be complied with or satisfied There was according to <NAME> no material to shift the risk of non persuasion I cannot think that natural justice is satisfied by a process whereby an unfair trial though not resulting in a valid expulsion will never the less have the effect of depriving the member of his right of appeal when a valid decision to expel him is subsequently made <NAME> made a pertinent submission that the court should determine and clarify the nature and scope of the review hearing whether they partake of the nature of a Fairness Hearing or of the nature of a post decisional hearing or whether the court would device some way in which the victims at large would have an effective sense of participation as envisaged in the <NAME> decision What was transacted with the court assistance between <ORG> on one side and the <ORG> on the other is now sought to be made binding on the tens of thousands of innocent victims who as the law has now declared had a right to be heard before the settle ment could be reached or approved Either they should have been heard before a settlement was approved in accordance with the law declared by this <ORG> or it at least must become demonstrable in a process in which they have a reasonable sense of participation that the settlement has been their evident advantage or at least the adverse consequences are effec tively neutralised AIR SC on a writ petition filed under Article of the Constitution by A for cancellation of the order of allotment passed by the Director of Rehabilitation in favour of the High <ORG> made an order cancelling the allotment though was not a party This Court rejected the contention observing that It is sufficient to say that there is nothing in Art of the Constitution to preclude <ORG> from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of plenary juris diction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it It is said that the respondents before us had no right to apply for review because they were not parties to the previous proceedings Before we go into the question whether the settle ment should be set aside on grounds of inadequacy of the settlement fund certain subsidiary contentions and argu ments may be noticed We may as well deal with these two contentions While the victim groups allege that there was a systematic attempt to suppress the claims <ORG> would say that the lack of response indicated that the claims were speculative and spurious and therefore the claimants did not offer themselves to medical examination In order to appreciate this grievance of the victim groups it is perhaps necessary to advert to the provisions of the Act and the Scheme attracted to this stage of proc essing of the claims Where the Deputy Commissioner is of the opinion that a claim made under paragraph does not fall in any of the categories speci fied in sub paragraph he may refuse to register the claim Provided that before so refusing he shall give a reasonable opportunity for a personal hear ing to the claimant If the claimant is not satisfied with the order of the Deputy Commissioner under sub paragraph or sub paragraph he may prefer an appeal against such order to the Commissioner who shall decide the same All those claimants who approach <NAME> even now are given a fresh date on which to appear for medical examination and are in formed accordingly It has to be recognised in this context that the guidelines for categorisation can only be a broad indicator as it is not possible for anyone to envisage all types of situations and prescribe for them Shall we set aside the settlement on the mere possibility that medical documentation and categorisation are faulty And that the figures of the various kinds of injuries and disablement indicated are undependable As of now medical documentation discloses that there is no conclusive evidence to establish a casual link between cancer incidence and MIC exposure Similarly there is no definite evidence that derangement in immune system of the gas exposes have taken place It is yet to be decided if the matter goes to trial That would indeed be a struggle with infinity as it would involve individual adjudication of tens of thousands of claims for purposes of quantification of damages <NAME> seems to urge that courts should only accept evidence that is scientifically valid and adhere to the standards of evidence implicit in the discipline while the <ORG> court urges that plaintiffs in presenting scientific evidence and expert scientific testimony should be held to legal standards of evidence And in <NAME> The Secretary of <ORG> for India AIR Calcutta it was observed Shall the injured party be allowed to recover no damages or merely nominal because he cannot show the exact amount of the certainty though he is ready to show to the satisfac tion of the Jury that he has suffered large damages by the injury Certainty it is true would be thus attained but it would be the certainty of injustice In the context of the problems presented by the issues of liability in cases of certain corporate torts beyond the corporate veil there is an impressive body of academic opinion amongst the school men that the very theo ries of limited corporate liability which initially served as incentives for commercial risk taking needs re thinking in certain areas of tortious liability of Corporations Petitioners described the results indicated by the medical categorisation done by <ORG> which showed only cases of total permanent disablement as shocking and wholly unrelated to the realities It is relevant here that <ORG> while quite fairly acknowledging that there was in fact such a settlement however sought to assail its validity on cer tain legal issues The legal contentions as to the validity of the settlement were permitted to be raised in as much as that an order made on consent would be at no higher footing and could be assailed on the grounds on which an agreement could be Respondents however raised several contentions as to the soundness of the <ORG> princi ple and its applicability The settlement cannot be assailed as violative of <NAME> princi ple which might have arisen for consideration in a strict adjudication Act and the Scheme flamed thereunder there is no scope for applying the <NAME> principle inasmuch as the tort feasor in terms of the settlement for all practical purposes stands notional ly substituted by the settlementfund which now represents and exhausts the liability of the alleged hazardous entre preneurs viz We must also add that the <NAME> principle can have no application against <ORG> inasmuch as requiring it to make good the deficiency if any we do not impute to it the position of a joint tort feasor but only of a welfare State There is therefore no substance in the point that <NAME> principle should guide the quantification of compensation to the victim claimants This necessarily takes us to the question of the medical surveillance costs and the operational expenses of the <ORG> Claims for damages for pre natal injuries have been made in many other jurisdictions but there is no English or Scottish authority as to whether a claim would lie and if it did what rules and limitations should govern it It is however important from our point of view to express our opinion reinforced by our general consultation and supported by the report of <ORG> that it is highly probable that the common law would in appropriate circumstances provide a remedy for a plaintiff suffering from a pre natal injury caused by another fault We must however observe that there is need for expedi tious adjudication and disposal of the claims We direct both <ORG> and <ORG> to take expeditious steps and set up adequate machinery for adjudication of claims and determination of the compensation We may briefly recapitulate those guidelines i The Claims Commissioner should in the case of minors invariably order the amount of compensation awarded to the minor to be invested in long term fixed depos its at least till the date of the minor at taining majority It is held that under Article of the Constitution the <ORG> had the necessary jurisdiction and power to do so iv The orders dated th th of February in so far a they seek to prohibit future criminal proceedings are held no to amount to a conferment of criminal immunity but are held to be merely consequential to the quash ing of the criminal proceedings In the result the Review Petitions arc allowed in part and all the contentions raised in the Review Petitions and the I As in the civil appeals are disposed of in terms of the findings recorded against the respective contentions The points which arise for determination on the plead ings documents and submissions made at the <ORG> in the course of the hearing of these petitions have been formulat ed at points A to in paragraph of my learned Broth er judgment and the conclusions reached by him have been summarised and set out in the penultimate paragraph of his judgment at i to ix with their sub paragraphs I agree that the settlement is not vitiated for not affording the victims or victim groups an opportunity or being heard but I find it difficult to persuade myself to the view that if the settlement I am in agreement with sub paragraphs a and thereof but so far as sub paragraphs and are concerned I agree with the directions therein as I understand them to be only recommendatory in nature and not linked with the settlement Taking the view that in enter ing upon the settlement regard should have been had to the views of the victims and for that purpose notices should have been issued before arriving at the settlement the majority held that post decisional notice might be suffi cient but in the facts and circumstances of this case no useful purpose would be served by giving a post decisional hearing having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the order of this <ORG> dated May and having regard to the fact that there are no further additional data and facts available with the victims which can profitably and meaningfully be presented to con trovert the basis of the settlement and further having regard to the fact that the victims had their say or on their behalf their views have been agitated in the proceed ings and will have further opportunity in the pending review proceedings In the circum stances it was held that there was no failure of justice necessitating the setting aside of the settlement as viola tive of fundamental rights After taking notice of the aforesaid view expressed by the learned Chief Justice <NAME> <NAME> myself concurring observed as under Though we are prima facie inclined to agree with him that there are good reasons why the settlement should not be set aside on the ground that the principles of natural justice have been violated quite apart from the prac tical complications that may arise as a result of such an order we would not express any final opinion on the validity of the settlement but would leave it open to be agitated to the extent permissible in law in the review petition pending before this Court Unfortunately before the judgment could be pronounced a tragic event took place One way of approaching the problem is to ask what the <ORG> could have done if a pre decisional hearing was afforded to the victims It could not have unilaterally imposed any additional liability on any of the contracting parties At the post decisional stage it must be satisfied that the victims are informed of or alive to the process of hearing individually or through press reports and if it is so satisfied it can apply its mind to the fairness and reasonableness of the settlement and either endorse it or refuse to do so And why should it burden the Indian tax payer with this liability when it is neither held liable in tort nor is it shown to have acted negligently in entering upon the settlement The <ORG> has to reach a definite conclusion on the question whether the compensation fixed under the agreement is adequate or other wise and based thereon decide whether or not to convert it into a decree If I had come to the conclusion that the settlement fund was inade quate I would have done the only logical thing of reviewing the settlement and would have Left the parties to work out a fresh settlement or go to trial in the pending suit I had therefore no time to write a detailed judg ment but just a little time to indicate in brief the crux of some of the reasons for my inability to agree with the view expressed in the judgment of Brother <NAME> on the question of <ORG> liability to make good the deficiency if any
