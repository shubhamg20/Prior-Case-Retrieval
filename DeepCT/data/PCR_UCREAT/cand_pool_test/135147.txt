Vs RESPONDENT CAPTAIN ITBAR SINGH AND OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH ACT Motor Car lnsurance Suit for damages by third Party Insurance company added defendants Defence if other than statutory available Interpretation of Motor Vehicles Act SS HEADNOTE A suit claiming damages for negligent driving was filed aginst the owner of a motor car who was insured against third party risks it contended that the defence available to it was not restricted to the grounds enumerated in Of the Act but that it was entitled to take all defences including those on which the assured himself could have relied for his defence subject only to the restriction that it could not in view of Of the Act rely on the conditions of the policy as a defence They should not be interpreted so as to oust other defences the insurer may wish to take that there was no accident or that the plaintiff was negligent or that there was contributory negligence etc When a person is joined as a party he has the right to take all defences permissible in law <NAME> Did the insurer have a right to be joined as a party apart from the statute Could he be joined under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure I am not basing my case on Order Rule to of the Code of Civil Procedure <NAME> Is it not correct that the statute gives the insurer a right to be joined as a party which he did not have previously If so the right cannot be extended beyond what the statute gives It is true that the statute gives a right to the insurer to become a party to the action by the injured person which he did not have previously but the real question before the court is whether sub limits the right to defend on the grounds stated in that sub section If it was intended that these were to be the only defences open to the insurer the word only should have been used instead of the words any of before the words the following grounds What the legislature meant was that the insurer could defend the action also on the grounds stated in sub in addition to other grounds It can mean either that the insurer can take other defences or that he is limited to the matters stated in sub Even the cases which hold that the defences of the insurer are limited to those stated in subS recognise that this causes hardship In those cases the hardship was sought to be overcome by allowing the insurer to defending the name of the insured I do not say that this latter procedure is correct but it shows that there is hardship <NAME> How can that be done How can the insurer be allowed to defend in the name of the insured How is the record to be kept There is no provision under which it can be done not even under of the Code of Civil Procedure The manner of avoiding liability stated in sub is that the insurer should apply to be made a party Consequently the insurer can avoid liability only by being joined as a party Hence the insurer can avoid liability only by being joined as a party but can take any defences he chooses including those stated in sub Otherwise the third party and the assured may collude and a judgment may be passed which the insurer would be bound to satisfy without having had an opportunity of defending himself The real party affected is the insurer and yet he is given no right to be heard except on the limited grounds stated in sub In the event of an accident the injured third party had a right to sue the motorist and recover damages The injured third party had no direct right of action against the insurer If the insurer failed to do so the third party had a right of action against the insurer based on the judgment Obtained against the assured In this action a notice had to be sent to the third party injured who was given a right to join as a party and oppose the action At common law the insurer had no right to intervene in the action by the injured party against the insured and oppose the claim on merits that there was no accident or negligence or that there was contributory negligence etc The insurer could avoid liability only by showing that he was not liable for some reason connected with the policy It does not give additional rights to the insurer over what he would have had at common law or in accordance with the English Statutes There is no ambiguity in There is no hardship caused by giving full effect to the section as it stands Sub section of the same section gives the insurer the right to recover from the <ORG> the excess which he is made to pay by virtue of over his obligations in the policy It is only made executable against the insurer Now the Bombay cases referred to by the Solicitor General are right in so far as they hold that the insurer can defend only on the grounds stated in sub Those cases are wrong in proceeding on the assumption that there is hardship caused to the insurer by this view Order Rule Code of Civil Procedure allows an ex parte decree to be set aside only at the instance of the defendant whilst there is no such limitation in There is no procedure known to law by which the insurer can be allowed to defend in the name of the insured This cannot be done under as it would contravene and allow the insurer to avoid liability in a manner other than the one allowed Should we express an opinion on that point The Solicitor General has adopted it as apart of his reasoning He has said that if the insurer can take all the defences in the name of the insured that is an additional reason why sub should not be interpreted as to limit the defences available to the insurer Actually the words of and are clear to show that the insurer can take only the defences mentioned in sub But if there be any doubt a consideration of the historical development of the law and the objects to be attained puts it beyond doubt that the legislature intended this result The suits had been filed against owners of motor cars for recovery of damages suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the negligent driving of the cars The terms of that subsection will have to be set out later but it may now be stated that it provided that an insurer added as a party to an action under it was entitled to defend on the grounds enumerated in it On being added as defendants the insurers filed written statements taking defences other than those mentioned in that sub section The plaintiffs contended that the written statements should be taken off the records as the insurers could defend the action only on the grounds mentioned in the sub section and on no others In one of the suits it was held that the insurer could take only the defences specified in that sub section and in the other suit the view taken was that the insurers were not confined to those defences <ORG> held that the insurers could defend the actions only on the grounds mentioned in the subsection and on no others Sub section of this section provides a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of person specified in the policy to the extent specified in subsection against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place Then comes round which the arguments advanced in this case have turned and some of its provisions have to be set out If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments No sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the Court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of sec tion or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire on reward or for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle in a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular Where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in clause of sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section be of no effect Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability or any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person No insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub section has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in subsection otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section It will have been noticed that sub of makes an insurer liable on the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured Sub section provides that no sum shall be payable by the insurer under sub unless he has been given notice of the proceedings resulting in that judgment and that an insurer who has been given such a notice shall be entitled to be made a party to the action and to defend it on the grounds enumerated The contention of the appellants is that when an insurer becomes a party to an action under sub he is entitled to defend it on all grounds available at law including the grounds on which the assured himself could have relied for his defence and that the only restriction on the insurer right of defence is that he cannot rely on the conditions of the policy which sub makes as of no effect This is the contention which we have to examine in these appeals To start with it is necessary to remember that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury Sub section of however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it The right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute It would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others To do that would be adding words to the statute It says that no insurer to whom the notice of the action has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability under sub otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section Now the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in subs is by successfully raising any of the defences therein mentioned It comes then to this that the insurer cannot avoid his liability except by establishing such defences Therefore sub clearly contemplates that he cannot take any defence not mentioned in subS If he could then he would have been in a position to avoid his liability in a manner other than that provided for in sub We therefore think that sub clearly provides that an insurer made a defendant to the action is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified in it Three reported decisions were cited at the bar and all of them proceeded on the basis that an insurer had no right to defend the action except on the grounds mentioned in sub It does not appear however to have been seriously contended in any of these cases that the insurer could defend the action on a ground other than one of those mentioned in sub The learned counsel for the respondents the plaintiffs in the action referred us to the analogous English statute The Road Traffic Act in support of the view that the insurer is restricted in his defence to the grounds set out in sub We proceed now to consider the arguments advanced by the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the appellants He contended that there was nothing in sub to restrict the defence of an insurer to the grounds therein enumerated said that as under sub an insurer was entitled to be made a defendant to the action it followed that he had the right to take all legal defences excepting those expressly prohibited Clause gives him the right to defend the action on the ground that the policy is void as having been obtained by non disclosure of a material fact or a material false representation of fact Therefore it cannot be said that in enacting sub the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy If that was what the legislature intended then there was nothing to prevent it from expressing its intention What the legislature has done is to enumerate in sub the defences available to an insurer and to provide by sub that he cannot avoid his liability excepting by means of such defences In order that sub may be interpreted in the way the learned Solicitor General suggests we have to add words to it The addition suggested will in our view make the language used unhappy and further effect a complete change in the meaning of the words used in the sub section As to sub the learned Solicitor General contended that the proper reading of it was that an insurer could not avoid his liability except by way of a defence upon being made a party to the action under sub The only manner of avoiding liability provided for in sub is through the defences therein mentioned There is another ground on which the learned Solicitor General supported the contention that all defences are open to an insurer excepting those taken away by sub He said that before the Act came into force an injured person had no right of recourse to the insurer and that it was that made the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured binding on the insurer and gave him a right against the insurer He then said that being so it is only fair that a person sought to be made bound by a judgment should be entitled to resist his liability under it by all defences which he can in law advance against the passing of it The Statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it It is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship We are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship First the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do That also seems to us to be equitable for the loss falls on the insurer in the course of his carrying on his business a business out of which he makes profit and he could so arrange his business that in the net result he would never suffer a loss On the other hand if the loss fell on the injured person it would be due to no fault of his it would have been a loss suffered by him arising out of an incident in the happening of which he had no hand at all We think that <ORG> was right in the view that it took In the result these appeals are dismissed with costs
