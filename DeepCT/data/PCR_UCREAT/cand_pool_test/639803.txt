On the questions Assuming that the proceedings in the present case were administrative proceedings whether principles of natural justice applied to them Whether there was a violation of such principles of natural justice in the present case Since the recommendations of the <ORG> were first considered by <ORG> and the final recommendations were made by the <ORG> whether there was any basis for the petitioners grievances Whether there were grounds for setting aside the selection of all the officers including those in the junior scales HELD The rules of natural justice operate in areas not covered by any law validly made that is they do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it If that is their purpose there is no reason why they should not be made applicable to administrative proceeding also especially when it is not easy to draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries from quasi judicial ones and an unjust decision in an administrative enquiry may have a more far reaching effect than a decision in a quasi judicial enquiry What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the enquiry is held and the constitution of the <ORG> or the body of persons appointed for that purpose at the time of selection the other members of the <ORG> did not know that the appeal of the superseded conservator was pending before <ORG> and hence there was no occasion for them to distrust the opinion of the Acting Chief Conservator There was a conflict between his interest and duty and he was a judge in his own cause Taking into consideration human probabilities and the ordinary course of human conduct there was reasonable ground for believing that the Acting Chief Conservator was likely to have been biased He did not participate in some of the deliberations of the <ORG> but the facts that he was a member of the <ORG> and that he participated in the deliberations when the claims of his rivals were considered and in the preparation of the list must have had its impact on the selection as the <ORG> in making the selection must necessarily have given weight to his opinion A JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos to of Sub of prescribes that all rules made under that section shall be laid for not less than fourteen days before <ORG> as soon as possible after they are made and shall be subject to such modifications whether by way of repeal or amendment as <ORG> may make on a motion made during the session in which they are so laid In pursuance of the power given under rules for the recruitment to <ORG> were made in Indian Forest Service Recruitment Rules Regulation provides for the constitution of a special selection board It says that the purpose of making selection to State cadre <ORG> shall constitute a special selection board consisting of the Chairman of the Union Public Service <ORG> or his nominee the Inspector General of Forests of <ORG> ad officer of <ORG> not below the rank of Joint Secretary the Chief Secretary to the State Government concerned or the Secretary of that Government dealing with the forests and the Chief Conservator of Forests of the State Government concerned It reads The <ORG> shall prepare in the order of preference a list of such officers of <ORG> who satisfy the conditions specified in regulation and who are adjudged by the <ORG> suitable for appointment to posts in the senior and junior scales of the <ORG> The list prepared in accordance with sub regulation shall then be referred to the Commission for advice by <ORG> along with a the records of all officers of <ORG> included in the list the records of all other eligible officers of <ORG> who are not adjudged suitable for inclusion in the list together with the reasons as recorded by the <ORG> for their non inclusion in the list and the observations if any of <ORG> on the recommendations of the Board We were told and we take it to be correct that he did not sit in the selection board at the time his name was considered for selection but admittedly he did sit in the board and participate in its deliberations when the names of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> his rivals were considered for selection It was contended before us that of the All India Services Act rule of the rules framed thereunder and Regulation of the Indian Forest Service Initial Recruitment Regulations are void as those provisions confer unguided uncontrolled and uncanalised power on the concerned delegates We have not thought it necessary to go into the question of the vires of rule and Regulation as we have come to the conclusion that the impugned selections must be struck down for the reasons to be presently stated There was considerable controversy before us as to the nature of the power conferred on the selection board under rule read with Regulation It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that that power was a quasi judicial power whereas the case for the contesting respondents was that it was a purely administrative power It was contended that such a power is essentially a judicial power and the same had to be exercised in accordance with the well accepted rules relating to the exercise of such a power For determining whether a power is an administrative power or a quasi judicial power one has to look to the nature of the power conferred the person or persons on whom it is conferred the framework of the law conferring that power the consequences ensuing from the exercise of that power and the manner in which that power is expected to be exercised The position as I see it is that the exact limits of the ancient remedy by way of certiorari have never been and ought not to be specifically defined Later again it extended to cases where there was no lis in the strict sense of the word but where immediate or subsequent rights of a citizen were affected In such a case this court has jurisdiction to supervise that process We have as it seems to me reached the position when the ambit of certiorari can be said to cover every case in which a body of persons of a public as opposed to a purely private or domestic character has to determine matters affecting subjects provided always that it has a duty to act judicially It is as Mr <NAME> said a servant of the <ORG> charged by the <ORG> by execu tive instruction with the duty of distributing the bounty of the Crown At every stage of this participation in the deliberations of the selection board there was a conflict between his interest and duty Therefore what we have to see is whether there is reasonable ground for believing that he was likely to have been biased In deciding the question of bias we have to take into consideration human probabilities and ordinary course of human conduct At this stage it may also be noted that at the time the selections were made the members of the selection board other than <NAME> were not likely to have known that <NAME> had appealed against his supersession and that his appeal was pending before <ORG> Therefore there was no occasion for them to distrust the opinion expressed by <NAME> Hence the board in making the selections must necessarily have given weight to the opinion expressed by <NAME> This takes us to the question whether the principles of natural justice apply to administrative proceedings similar to that with which we are concerned in these cases It is not necessary to examine those decisions as there is a great deal of fresh thinking on the subject The question how far the principles of natural justice govern administrative enquiries came up for consideration before <ORG> in In re An Infant In the course of his judgment Lord <NAME> observed thus But at the same time I myself think that even if an immigration officer is not in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him of the matters in the subsection and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him That is not as I see it a question of acting or being required to act judicially but of being required to act fairly Good administration and an honest or bona fide decision must as it seems to me require not merely impartiality nor merely bringing one mind to bear on the problem but acting fairly and to the limited extent that the circumstances of any particular case allow and within the legislative frame work under I appreciate that in saying that it may be said that one is going further than is permitted on the decided cases because heretofore at any rate the decisions of the courts do seem to have drawn a strict line in these matters according to whether there is or is not a duty to act judicially or quasi judicially It is true that the order is administrative in character but even an administrative order which involves civil consequences as already stated must be made consistently with the rules of natural justice after informing the first respondent of the case of the State The aim of the rules of natural justice is to secure justice or to put it negatively to prevent miscarriage of justice These rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made In other words they do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it In the past it was thought that it included just two rules namely no one shall be a judge in his own case Nemo debet esse judex propria causa and no decision shall be given against a party without affording him a reasonable hearing audi alteram partem Till very recently it was the opinion of the courts that unless the authority concerned was required by the law under which it functioned to act judicially there was no room for the application of the rules of natural justice What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the enquiry is held and the constitution of the <ORG> or body of persons appointed for that purpose Looking at the composition of the board and the nature of the duties entrusted to it we have no doubt that its recommendations should have carried considerable weight with the If the decision of the selection board is held to have been vitiated it is clear to our mind that the final recommendation made by the <ORG> must also be held to have been vitiated In this connection he invited our attention to the decision of this Court in <NAME> <ORG> and another The Court came to the conclusion that on the material on record it was unable to uphold that plea In that case there was no question of any conflict between duty and interest nor any members of the departmental promotion committee was a judge in his own case He urged that even if we are to hold that <ORG> should not have participated in the deliberations of the selection board while it considered the suitability of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> there is no ground to set aside the selection of other officers Every officer who had put in a service of years or more even if he was holding the post of an Assistant Conservator of Forests was eligible for being selected for the senior scale service
