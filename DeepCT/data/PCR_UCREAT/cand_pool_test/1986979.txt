CASE NO Appeal civil of PETITIONER <NAME> SINGH RESPONDENT HARMINDER SINGH JASSI DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH DR A ANAND CJI RAJENDRA BABU LAHOTI JUDGMENT JUDGMENT Supp SCR The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an appeal under Section A of the Representation of the People Act preferred by the appellant petitioner before <ORG> feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Designated Election Judge of <ORG> of Punjab and Haryana dismissing the election petition laying challenge to the election of the respondent The learned Designated Election Judge of <ORG> has found none of the allegations made by the appellant proved The findings recorded on the following issues only are subject matter of this appeal Issue No Whether the election of the respondent is liable to be declared void for the reasons enumerated by the petitioner in para No a to of the petition The pleadings relevant to these issues insofar as necessary for the purpose of deciding this appeal shall be suitably extracted and reproduced at their appropriate places hereinafter We will take up for consideration and deal with the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties issue wise The appellant specific request for inspection of the nomination papers was not allowed by the returning officer who said that there was no need of such inspection As to the production of the certified copy of the electoral roll it is stated by the respondent that the certified copy showing the name of the respondent as entered in the electoral roll of Pucca Kalan Constituency was produced before the returning officer of <NAME> at A on i one hour before the commencement of scrutiny of nomination papers and thus at the time of scrutiny the certified copy was very much there before the returning officer and thus the mandate of Section of the Act was fully complied with In between there was a change in the leadership of <ORG> The documentary evidence brought on record by the appellant himself through <NAME> PW Superintendent of Punjab <ORG> goes to show that Smt There were as many as transfers and not that <NAME> alone was transferred for the purpose of being accommodated or posted to fulfil somebody demand On the principal controversy as to whether the certified copy of the relevant extract from the voters list of Pucca Kalan Constituency showing the respondent as an elector entered therein was available or not before the returning officer at the time of scrutiny of nomination papers at A on the case sought to be made out by the appellant at the trial is at variance with the one set out in the election petition The relevant legal provisions around which revolves the controversy are contained in sub section of Section and sub sections and of Section of the Act On the date fixed for the scrutiny of nominations under section the candidates their election agents one proposer of each candidate and one other person duly authorised in writing by each candidate but no other person may attend at such time and place as the returning officer may appoint and the returning officer shall give them all reasonable facilities for examining the nomination papers of all candidates which have been delivered within the time and in the manner laid down in section The second important fact discernible from the averments made in the petition is that the certified copy of the requisite electoral roll was applied for on st January and was available with the respondent on that day itself though according to the appellant it could not have been produced before the returning officer on that day at A i the time at which it purports to have been produced before the returning officer according to the endorsement made under his hand on such certified copy According to the appellant no such copy was produced upto the time of the scrutiny and apparently the said endorsement was falsely made to validate the nomination paper of the returned candidate and hence the nomination papers filed by the respondent were liable to the rejected He was asked to collect the certified copy either in the evening of th January or in the morning of st January The learned senior counsel for the appellant has invited attention of the Court to many other copying applications and entries in that regard contained in the copying register and other papers which go to show that similar applications for certified copies made by some other applicants or candidates were received and copies delivered on the same day A substantial part of submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant is directed towards the inconsistency in the dates appearing on the documents Ext Ext towards copying charges as to which the receipt was also prepared there is no reason why the receipt would have been prepared and issued on It was submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the certified copy issued under the signature of <NAME> PW could have been so issued only after or A Then it was impossible to produce the same at A on the same day before the returning officer in his office situated at a distance of about kilometers On behalf of the appellant reliance was also placed on the statement of <NAME> PW an official of the <ORG> who had brought the record of opening and closing of railway crossing Kartar Singh Wala and the statement of <NAME> PW Executive Engineer Roads and Bridges There is an alternate route also which is via Anaj Mandi It was stated by learned counsel for the appellant that assuming the time of presentation of the certified copy to the returning officer as A on as per the endorsement made by the returning officer thereon and calculating the time backwards by adjusting the commuting time the certified copy should have been delivered before a which certainly was not done as per the oral testimony of the officials associated with the preparation and delivery of the certified copy Two other submissions made by learned senior counsel for the appellant may also be noted It was supplied to him within to minutes whereafter the returned candidate immediately rushed in his car to Talwandi Sabo so as to produce the same before the returning officer at A The evidence adduced on behalf of the respondent is that the certified copy was applied for on th January which being at variance from the plea taken in the written statement is liable to be discarded It was submitted by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the story of the certified copy having been applied for at A on the same having been prepared and delivered within minutes and thereafter having been produced before the returning officer at A in spite of the railway crossing gate having remained closed for some time is a fantastic story not liable to be accepted even for a moment by the <ORG> There is some inconsistency as to the actual date of receipt of copying application Ex A which he refused to explain as those entries were not in his hand and he had no direct or personal knowledge thereof The possibility of application for certified copy having been moved on th January cannot be ruled out from the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant We have to take a realistic and practical view of the things as they happen We have no reason to doubt the independence and trustworthiness of <NAME> as a returning officer who was the Sub Divisional Magistrate and entrusted by the election commission with the task of performing his duties as one of the returning officers in the legislative assembly elections It was submitted by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the respondent had summoned <NAME> alongwith the record but the witness was given up without being examined The learned counsel for the respondent has rightly submitted that there was no need for the respondent to have exercised his influence for managing or procuring ante timing of the production of certified copy before the returning officer There is no reason why the respondent would have gone on to the extent of pressurising the returning officer to ante time the receipt of the certified copy and there is no reason why the returning officer would have obliged him We find substance in the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent He had made a contemporaneous record of the presence of persons who were actually present at the time of scrutiny We do not find any reason to disbelieve the presence of this witness around and in the office of the returning officer as stated by him We do not agree with the learned senior counsel for the appellant in his criticism of credibility of the witness on the ground that the factum of such presence of <NAME> has not been pleaded in the written statement filed by the respondent There is nothing unnatural about the person who himself had filed his nomination paper being present at or around the office of the returning officer so as to learn what was transpiring there at and what was the result of the scrutiny Inasmuch as we find that the appellant was not present before the returning officer at the time of scrutiny of nomination papers we see no substance in his plea that he had asked for inspection of all the nomination papers and yet the returning officer had denied the same to him It was submitted in the alternative by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that even if the appellant case that the certified copy of the relevant entry from the electoral roll of Pucca Kalan Constituency was not produced by the respondent until the scrutiny was over was held liable to be discarded the appellant was still entitled to succeed on the case set up by the respondent himself Therefore to enable the returning officer to decide whether a candidate is qualified to stand or whether a proposer is qualified to propose he must have a complete copy of the relevant part of the roll If he has not a complete copy he will not be able to decide whether the candidate or the proposer has the necessary qualification Firstly the object sought to be achieved by Section is fulfilled if the requisite document is available before the returning officer at the time of scrutiny even if the same was not filed alongwith the nomination paper meaning thereby the production of the requisite document subsequent to the filling of the nomination paper but before the time of scrutiny so as to be available before the returning officer at the time of scrutiny would meet the requirement of Section But that does not mean that the document made available to the returning officer before the time of scrutiny cannot be looked into by him at the time of scrutiny for the purpose of satisfying himself of the compliance by a candidate with Section of the Act Secondly <NAME> the returning officer has deposed on oath that he had been supplied with the electoral roll of Pucca Kalan Constituency under the instructions of <ORG> and that was available with him which could have been looked into for the purpose of satisfying himself whether the respondent was an elector of Pucca Kalan Constituency or not We have no reason to disbelieve the same We uphold the finding recorded by the learned Designated Election Judge on this issue Before we may proceed to deal in exercise of our appellate jurisdiction with the pleas raised on behalf of the petitioner appellant canvassing commission of corrupt practices by the respondent which in the opinion of <ORG> the election petitioner has failed in proving we would like to state a few well settled legal principles in the field of election jurisprudence and relevant to our purpose It has been held in <NAME> case supra that the election petitioner is also obliged to disclose his source of information in respect of the commission of the corrupt practice so as to bind him to the charge levelled by him and to prevent any fishing or roving enquiry also be prevent the returned candidate from being taken by surprise With so much statement of law we proceed to deal with the relevant issues relating to corrupt practices That on getting this information the petitioner immediately telephoned the observer at Bhatinda at about the observer replied that he will take due care of it He went to the spot and made enquiries from various residents of that place In the affidavit accompanying the petition it is stated that the facts stated in paras a and of the petition are based on the information received from <NAME> and <NAME> who have been examined at the trail as PW and PW respectively The averments made in the petition have been specifically denied in the written statement filed by the respondent The appellant filed replication to the written statement filed by the respondent The learned Designated Election Judge has discussed the relevant pleadings and the evidence adduced by the parties in <ORG> Upon an independent evaluation of the evidence adduced by the parties through which we have been taken by the learned counsel for the parties we find ourselves in entire agreement with the view taken by <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> had told the observer that the respondent had given them the offer of paying Rs He has positively stated that he gave this information to the observer and the latter had noted his name in a diary He further stated that he had made a complaint to the observer as regards the threat given to him and the observer had noted his name also in his diary Looking at the seriousness of the allegation made he immediately rushed to village Mor Mandi as per the information given by the appellant He interviewed about to persons in order to verify the allegations made by the appellant in Gandhi Basti but none substantiated the allegations so made Nothing has been brought on record to show to whom the <ORG> car belonged According to the appellant the respondent incurred and authorised expenditure over and above the limit prescribed by Section of the Act read with Rules and of the Conduct of Election Rules and thereby committed a corrupt practice within the meaning of Section of the Act For the purpose of Section read with Section of the Act the expenses relevant are those incurred by the respondent between and both days inclusive The learned senior counsel for the appellant has very fairly stated the though all the averments made in the petition were put to trial and evidence was adduced by the appellant but at this stage he would press for decision only the alleged expenses incurred on account of the posters which were got printed distributed and pasted in the constituency by the respondent There is substantial difference between the actual cost and the one shown in the return of expenses to the tune of Rs Here itself we may state that as per the affidavit filed in support of the election petition the averments made in sub para a and of the para are stated to be true to the personal knowledge of the appellant while the contents of sub paras and are stated to be based on information received from <NAME> and believed by the appellant to be true From the averments made in the petition it cannot be deduced that the expenditure on account of the posters even if incurred by the respondent was so incurred between the date of nomination and the date of declaration of result of the election As per explanation appended to sub section of Section any expenditure incurred or authorised by a political or by any other association or body of persons or by any independent other than the candidate or his election agent is not be counted as of expenditure by the candidate or his election agent attracting applicability of Section He had also taken into possession some election material in the shape of posters stickers pamphlets small flags etc In the above state of evidence no inference can be drawn that the statement of expenses and the vouchers as filed by the respondent were false or that the expenditure incurred on the posters had resulted into crossing the prescribed limit of expenditure We agree with the findings recorded by the learned Designated Election Judge that issue no is not proved He accompanied by <NAME> went to the houses of <NAME> and <NAME> The allegations have been denied in the written statement filed by the respondent The learned Designated Election Judge has extensively dealt with the evidence adduced by the parties and found the incident as to beating of the two ladies and removal of flags from their houses proved However the learned Judge has also recorded a finding that there was no iota of evidence to prove the respondent having at any time visited village Natt in order to shield the two persons involved in the incident The learned Judge has also found that there was sheer exaggeration and faint attempt made by the appellant to connect the respondent with the incident In the opinion of the learned Designated Election Judge the incident appeared to be an outcome of the zeal of the Sarpanch <NAME> and the other person <NAME> who did so of their own and was probably an act of over enthusiasm in politics but there was no reliable evidence not even any facts or circumstances to infer the involvement of the respondent in the incident or to hold the act of <NAME> and <NAME> having been committed at the behest of the respondent There is no material brought on record to infer the result of the election having been materially affected by the beating of the two ladies The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that <NAME> was later appointed as a counting agent by the respondent In the case at hand there are neither such pleadings nor proof as to the alleged violence having been committed by <NAME> and <NAME> with the consent of the returned candidate or of his election agent
