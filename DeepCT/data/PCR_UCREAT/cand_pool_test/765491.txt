On a representation made by respondent No waiver was granted for a period of six months for his consideration for promotion to the rank of <ORG> Commander VCOAS It was contended on behalf of respondent No that days after respondent No was recommended for promotion by respondent No Appellant No herein on March a proposal was mooted for appointment of the <ORG> Commander <ORG> for filling up the vacancy that arose on March when respondent No was recommended for promotion appointment to the post of <ORG> Commander <ORG> On respondent No approaching <ORG> on March while directing notice it was made clear that if any appointment is made to the post of <ORG> Commander <ORG> the same shall be subject to the result of the writ petition <ORG> commented on the manner of dealing with the files as rather strange and observed that there is inconsistency in the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants inasmuch as only seniority of an officer is important that the words senior most officer who is otherwise fit should be understood as that an officer whose name has been recommended by the <ORG> is also fit in all respects <ORG> noticed that the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the Circular dated October was complementary to the Circular dated October does not inspire any confidence and it is not one of those orders issued in terms of Article of the Constitution Indeed he submitted that up to the stage of appointment as Lt Further tests are held almost automatically unless there is something adverse as to their fitness He stated that in these cases it is only seniority that governs and that when it was ignored the matter was taken to <ORG> and <ORG> has given relief in this case and therefore this <ORG> should not interfere in the order made by it As respondent No was the only person to be affected by this new criterion which was sought to be enforced without any lead time contrary to the earlier practice in his statutory complaint dated he made an alternative request that this stipulation may be waived in his case as the delay in his promotions have been caused entirely in the interest of service and he specifically mentioned that the vacancy was due to occur on March and he should be considered for the same There is no requirement of assessment of comparative merit both in the case of seniority cum fitness and seniority cum merit <NAME> also submitted that circular dated of <ORG> to the extent it applies to the appointment of <ORG> Commanders and is at variance with the letter dated October setting out the criteria laid down by the President for appointment of <ORG> Commanders cannot be acted upon It was submitted on behalf of respondent No that an <ORG> Commander having experience of operations during war and extensive counter insurgency may be more suitable for commanding the <ORG> rather than for an equivalent staff post at the <ORG> and vice versa and that even the highest post in any organisation need not be a selection post to be filled on the basis of comparative assessment of merit of eligible officers It means suitability for the particular command or the particular staff appointment as the case may be and that suitability is related to the command in question or the staff appointment in question and there is no mention of any comparative assessment of merit even in that circular Another submission that has been made by <NAME> is that consent to go on deputation cannot take away the right to be considered for promotion and if selected for promotion and that the policy regarding willingness certificate cannot in any event hold good beyond the normal tenure of three years of officers sent on foreign assignments in public interest and if the post of <ORG> Commander is a non selection post to which appointment has to be made on the basis of seniority subject to fitness in all respects and fulfillment of both these criteria having already been held in his favour by the Chief of the <ORG> Staff <ORG> was justified in issuing the writ The matter put before this Court in the light of the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties and the pleadings raised or the findings recorded by <ORG> we have to consider the same from five facets of the case i Whether the Army Commander holds a selection post or one which is based on seniority but the officer should be fit in every respect for such appointment and should have a minimum of two years before retirement from the date of appointment as Army Commander VCOAS ii Whether the instructions given on October are executive instructions not supportable in law which stipulate that an officer to be eligible to the post of Corps Commander should either be eligible to become an Army Commander or should have a minimum of four years residual service on the date he is promoted to the rank of Lt General <NAME> in making his recommendations Several decisions have been cited before us on either side by the learned counsel appearing in this case but we are not adverting to the same since we are not in any way detracting from the principles stated therein nor are we enunciating any new principle It is urged on behalf of <ORG> and Lt Even if we accept the view taken by <ORG> that <ORG> communication in this regard merely amounted to an executive instruction and not supported by any orders made by the President of India or <ORG> the learned Attorney General submitted that the other parameters that are clearly laid down in the letters of <ORG> should be strictly followed that is all officers who are likely to be eligible for an <ORG> Commander appointment in terms of two years residual service will have to be given command of a <ORG> and unless such officer has commanded the <ORG> for at least one year he cannot be considered for promotion In the present case respondent No became a <ORG> Commander on September and the vacancy in the post of <ORG> Commander arose on March and thus he had not completed one year of experience as a <ORG> Commander and he had put in months and days experience and to this if we add the waiver granted by the Government in terms of months it will only be months and days experience On November the Chief of the <ORG> Staff recorded a note in the following terms In view of the above I recommend that redress be granted to tbe Gen officer by way of granting months AE waiver to him for consideration for promotion to the appointment of <ORG> Cdr VCOAS for a vacancy occurring on Mar The basis upon which <ORG> proceeded is that having taken all the issues into consideration the respondents have taken a stand totally contrary to the recommendations of the Chief of the <ORG> Staff as well as <ORG> The absence of the concerned officer from India on an assignment in the Embassy of France the waiver granted only for a period of six months and other various factors taken into account are also set out in the following terms In view of the above detailed examination of the case <ORG> is of the view that Lt On respondent No made a statutory complaint that his case should be considered on the basis of merit cum seniority subject to being found fit for promotion and ultimately prayed for the following The decision to defer his case in connection with the selection board met on October may be reviewed and if he is deemed to have been placed in command of a corps retrospectively from the date of declaration of the results of <ORG> For purposes of convenience we may set out the relevant portion of the note Lt Since he has worked for about years in field areas It also appears from his records that he did not participate in operations Since he has worked for about years in remote field areas in the Eastern Sector especially the border areas with China The learned Attorney General therefore took great pains to bring the entire records relating to the relevant period which was considered by the Cabinet Secretary and sought to point out that there were notings available on those files which justify these remarks In that view of the matter we think there is no justification for the High <ORG> to have interfered with the order made by the <ORG> In the result we allow the appeals filed by <ORG> and Lt
