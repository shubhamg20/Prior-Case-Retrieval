The period of probation expired in July and there was no extension of it The respondent replied that be wanted an opportunity of being heard in person There was however no enquiry at all and much later by an order dated th May <ORG> reverted him to his substantive post in the Delhi The respondent thereupon challenged the order on the grounds namely that on the expiry of the period of probation and on his passing the departmental examinations he became entitled to a substantive permanent appointment that the impugned order terminated his service under <ORG> and removed him from the said service in viola tion of the provisions of Art of the Constitution and under of <ORG>s Punishment and Appeal Rules it was mandatory that before his employment as a probationer could be terminated be should have been apprised of the grounds of the proposed termination and given an opportunity to show cause against it The respondent could not complain against the order reverting him to his former post because the order of reversion was not by way of punishment The circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination of service of a public servant have to be examined in each case determining whether the order was by way of punishment But the services of a temporary servant or a probationer can be terminated under the rules of his employment and such termination without anything more will not attract the operation of Art As <ORG> had not considered the contention of the respondent based on of <ORG>s Punishment and Appeal Rules the matter should be remanded to <ORG> for consideration of that question Appeal from the judgment and order dated January of <ORG> in Letters Patent Appeal No of No of reversing a decision of a single Judge of that Court who had dismissed a writ petition filed by the respondents on June to declare that the order of the first appellant reverting him to his permanent post in <ORG> was invalid and to quash the same The petitioner replied to the charge sheet on January stating that he wanted an opportunity of being heard in person According to the petitioner the said order of th May terminated his service under <ORG> and permanently removed him from <ORG> The petitioner also complained that under of the Punjab Civil Services Punishment and Appeal Rules he should have been apprised of the grounds to terminate his employment as probationer for any specific fault or on account of any unsatisfactory record or unfavourable reports implying his unsuitability for service and given an opportunity to show cause against the same before any orders were passed by the authority competent to terminate the appointment The petitioner was never apprised of the rounds of any such proposal nor given an opportunity to show cause against it before the order reverting him to the post of Superintendent mentioned above was made There was thus a clear breach of of the Punjab Civil Service Executive Branch Rules Accordingly the petitioner prayed that the said order of th May be quashed and suitable relief be given to him The points put forward before the learned single Judge who heard the petition were On the expiry of the period of probation and on his passing the departmental examinations the petitioner became qualified for substantive permanent appointment The impugned order in fact terminated his services under <ORG> and removed him from the said service The petitioner was not afforded any opportunity to show cause against the charges contained in the charge sheet or against the proposed punishment As such there was violation of the provisions of Art The procedure prescribed by the rule was not followed although it was mandatory that before his employment as a probationer could be terminated he should have been apprised of the grounds of the proposed termination and given an opportunity to show cause against it On behalf of the petitioner reference was made to the definition of Government contained in of the Punjab Civil Service Rules and the definition of cadre contained in and it was submitted that if the peti tioner had held a substantive post in a cadre under <ORG> and had been appointed on probation to another post then the term probationer would not have covered his case but since the petitioner held a lien on a post in Delhi State and not under <ORG> he could not be deemed to fall within the exception contained in the definition of a probationer in Reference was made to a number of other rules on behalf of both the parties The learned Judge was of the view that there was force in the contention that of the Punishment and Appeal Rules could not cover the case of revision as only dealt with a case where it was proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer In the result he dismissed the application of provided that an order of dismissal removal or reduction should not be passed unless the person concerned had been given reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him while sub Accordingly the conclusion reached was that the reversion of the appellant was by way of punishment and amounted either to reduction in rank or removal from the <ORG> Executive Branch and as these actions could not be taken without affording the appellant adequate opportunity of showing cause against the punishment there was violation of Art He would have cause to complain if he could show that the order of reversion was by way of punishment The mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the Government has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a lower post or rank cannot in any circumstances be a punishment The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to If the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service He submitted an explanation which was considered by the Deputy Inspector General of Police as unsatisfactory The said authority passed an order discharging the respondent from service for unsatisfactory work and conduct The respondent contention was that the order was invalid because he had not been given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the proposed action in terms of Art and that he was not give an opportunity to be heard nor was any evidence taken on the chaires Finally it was held by this Court in <NAME> case that the fact of the holding of an enquiry is not decisive of the question On August the <ORG> passed an order reverting the appellant to his substantive post in Class and trans ferred him from <ORG> to <ORG> Losing appeal before <ORG> the appellant came to this Court by special leave It was contended on his behalf that the order of st August amounted to infliction of punishment In dismissing the appeal it was pointed out by this Court that the enquiry which was held by the Commissioner in this case was in the nature of a preliminary enquiry to enable the <ORG> to decide whether disciplinary action should be taken against the appellant According to this Court the action of the Government was in pursuance of its right to revert an officer holding a higher post temporarily if he was not found He was served with a charge sheet to the effect that he had received illegal ratification and called upon to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him The appellant submitted his explanation and the Settlement Officer who had sent out the charge sheet submitted his report to the Deputy Commissioner that the charge relating to receipt of illegal gratification had been proved It was held by this Court that the enquiry made by the Settlement Officer was with the object of ascertaining whether disciplinary action should be taken against the appellant for his misdemeanour and the purpose of the enquiry was to take punitive action including dismissal or removal from service if the charge was substantiated be continued and a acting bona fide in that behalf the authority may also give a chance to the servant to explain if any complaints are made against him or his competence or suitability is disputed on some grounds arising from the discharge of his work but such an enquiry would be held only for the purpose of deciding whether the temporary servant should be Continued or not There is no element of punitive proceedings in such an enquiry the idea in holding such an enquiry is not to punish the temporary servant but just to decide whether he deserves to be continued in service or not in some cases the authority may choose to exercise its power to dismiss a temporary servant and that would necessitate a formal departmental enquiry in that behalf If such a formal enquiry is held and an order terminating the services of a temporary servant is passed as a result of the finding recorded in the said enquiry prima facie the termination would amount to the dismissal of the temporary servant The <ORG> however was careful to add that considerations of the motive operating in the mind of the authority had to be eliminated in determining the character of the termination of service of a temporary servant and that the form in which the order terminating his services was expressed would not also be decisive As he was not a confirmed government servant his services could be terminated under of the Central Civil Service Temporary Service Rules with one month notice on either side had been certain complaints against him in respect whereof the Chairman of <ORG> sent a notice to him asking him to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him and an Enquiry Officer was appointed but before the enquiry could be completed the Chairman recommended that the services of the appellant should be terminated under observing in his note to the Secretary that The departmental proceedings will take a much longer time and we are not sure whether after going through all the formalities we will be able to deal with the accused in the way he deserves The services of a temporary servant or a probationer can be terminated under the rules of his employment and such termination without anything more would not attract the operation of Art The circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination of service have to be examined in each case the motive behind it being immaterial If the order visits the public servant with any evil consequences or casts an aspersion against his character or integrity it must be considered to be one by way of punishment no matter whether he was a mere probationer or a temporary servant An order of termination of service in unexceptionable form preceded by an enquiry launched by the superior authorities only to ascertain whether the public servant should be retained in service does not attract the operation of Art i an Enquiry Officer is appointed a charge sheet submitted explanation called for and considered any order of termination of service made thereafter will attract the operation of the said article We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of <ORG> and remand the matter to that court for consideration of the respective contentions of the parties based on Punjab Civil Services Punishment and Appeal Rules <ORG> Appeal allowed and case remanded
