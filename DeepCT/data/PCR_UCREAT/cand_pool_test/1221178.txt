Seven persons faced trial for allegedly having committed homicidal death of one <NAME> hereinafter referred to as the deceased and causing injuries on various persons in furtherance of their common intention after forming themselves into an unlawful assembly They were charged for commission of offences punishable under Sections read with Section Section read with Section and read with Section Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows <NAME> hereinafter referred to as the deceased was the father of <NAME> PW <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW Thereafter there was a wordy altercation between A and PW in the presence of PW and should be assaulted even if a murder takes place since they had stepped into their house and shouted The accused persons pleaded innocence and therefore the trial was conducted Since the accused persons had exercised the right of private defence the conclusions of the courts below cannot be maintained Merely because some of the accused persons have suffered some injuries which were superficial in nature there is no question of interference with the well reasoned and well discussed judgment of the courts below Section IPC provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence The Section does not define the expression right of private defence It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right Whether in a particular set of circumstances a person legitimately acted in the exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case No test in the abstract for determining such a question can be laid down In determining this question of fact the <ORG> must consider all the surrounding circumstances It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self defence In a given case the <ORG> can consider it even if the accused has not taken it if the same is available to be considered from the material on record Under Section of the Indian Evidence Act in short the Evidence Act the burden of proof is on the accused who sets up the plea of self defence and in the absence of proof it is not possible for the <ORG> to presume the truth of the plea of self defence The <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances It is for the accused to place necessary material on record either by himself adducing positive evidence or by eliciting necessary facts from the witnesses examined for the prosecution An accused taking the plea of the right of private defence is not necessarily required to call evidence he can establish his plea by reference to circumstances transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself The question in such a case would be a question of assessing the true effect of the prosecution evidence and not a question of the accused discharging any burden Where the right of private defence is pleaded the defence must be a reasonable and probable version satisfying the <ORG> that the harm caused by the accused was necessary for either warding off the attack or for forestalling the further reasonable apprehension from the side of the accused The burden of establishing the plea of self defence is on the accused and the burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record Sections to define the extent of the right of private defence of body If a person has a right of private defence of body under Section that right extends under Section to causing death if there is reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the assault AIR SC runs as follows It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self defence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that while the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt the accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying basis for that plea in the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence evidence The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence beyond reasonable doubt Non explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of occurrence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance This principle applies to cases where the injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and credit worthy that it far outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries A plea of right of private defence cannot be based on surmises and speculation While considering whether the right of private defence is available to an accused it is not relevant whether he may have a chance to inflict severe and mortal injury on the aggressor In order to find whether the right of private defence is available to an accused the entire incident must be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting Section deals with the subject matter of right of private defence The plea of right comprises the body or property i of the person exercising the right or ii of any other person and the right may be exercised in the case of any offence against the body and in the case of offences of theft robbery mischief or criminal trespass and attempts at such offences in relation to property Section lays down the limits of the right of private defence Sections and give a right of private defence against certain offences and acts The right given under Sections to and to is controlled by Section To claim a right of private defence extending to voluntary causing of death the accused must show that there were circumstances giving rise to reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused to him The burden is on the accused to show that he had a right of private defence which extended to causing of death Sections and IPC define the limit and extent of right of private defence Sections and IPC deal with commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of body and property respectively The right commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence although the offence may not have been committed but not until there is that reasonable apprehension In <NAME> State of Punjab AIR SC it was observed that as soon as the cause for reasonable apprehension disappears and the threat has either been destroyed or has been put to route there can be no occasion to exercise the right of private defence In order to find whether right of private defence is available or not the injuries received by the accused the imminence of threat to his safety the injuries caused by the accused and the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be considered In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often difficult to expect the parties to preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation commensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use of force it would be lawful to repel the force in self defence and the right of private defence commences as soon as the threat becomes so imminent Such situations have to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes to detect slight or even marginal overstepping Due weightage has to be given to and hyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of the moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct where self preservation is the paramount consideration The <ORG> dealing with the plea has to weigh the material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable The right of self defence is a very valuable right serving a social purpose and should not be construed narrowly Situations have to be judged from the subjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding excitement and confusion of the moment confronted with a situation of peril and not by any microscopic and pedantic scrutiny In adjudging the question as to whether more force than was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be inappropriate as held by this <ORG> to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would be so natural in a <ORG> room or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a perfectly cool bystander The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to himself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step by step with any arithmetical exactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary times or under normal circumstances In these cases he is not obliged to retreat and may not merely resist the attack where he stands but may indeed pursue his adversary until the danger is ended and if in a conflict between them he happens to kill his attacker such killing is justifiable The right of private defence is essentially a defensive right circumscribed by the governing statute i the IPC available only when the circumstances clearly justify it It is a right of defence not of retribution expected to repel unlawful aggression and not as retaliatory measure A right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive particularly when the need to defend no longer survived Though it cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that whenever death occurs on account of a single blow Section is ruled out the fact situation has to be considered in each case It appears from the records as noted above that a single blow was given on the head of the deceased by a small wooden yoke Custodial sentence of years would meet the ends of justice
