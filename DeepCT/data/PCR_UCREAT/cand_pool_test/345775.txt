That mortgage as will later appear was executed in favour of <NAME> whose heirs assigned it to the plaintiffs on the th of June By that deed <NAME> was entitled to hold possession of the properties hypothecated until the amount of the zarpeshgi Rs On the st of December <NAME> and his mother <NAME> executed a simple mortgage in favour of <NAME> and <NAME> of amongst other properties the annas share in No Ghowspur Dopahra and the annas share in No Ghowspur Dopahra Decrees for sale were made in these suits On that assignment such rights as <NAME> had acquired and were then existing passed to the plaintiffs On the nd of September the plaintiffs in whom was then vested <NAME> right as mortgagee under the mortgage of the th of February filed their plaint in this suit making them or by subsequent amendment of their plaint the representatives of <NAME> who was then dead and others who were interested in the mortgage properties or in some of them defendants The Subordinate Judge decreed the suit for sale with costs giving the defendant No a right to redeem the mortgage so far as it affected the properties other than No Ghowpur Dopahra No Ghowspur Dopahra and Fatehpur <NAME> by payment within ninety days of the decretal amount with costs The defendants Nos to were given a right to redeem the mortgage so far as it affected No Ghowspur Dopahra by payment within ninety days of Rs with proportionate costs the defendant No was given a right to redeem the mortgage so far as it affected <ORG> on payment of Rs with proportionate costs and any of the defendants Nos and were given a right to redeem the mortgage so far as it affected Fatehpur The heirs of <NAME> were persons having an interest in the properties comprised in the mortgages of the is that of December the of December and the th of December and consequently were under Section of the Transfer of Property Act necessary parties to the suits for sale on those mortgages and were made defendants to those suits and not having set up in those suits such rights as they had under the mortgage of the th of February and the zarpeshgi deed of Section Explanation of the Code of the Civil Procedure applied and the claims of the plaintiffs appellants as against No Ghowspur Dopahra and No Ghowspur Dopahra and those of the defendants who are alone concerned with those mouzahs are barred It has been contended that as <NAME> when she lent her Rs It is true that so far as the zarpeshgi deed of the th of November operated as a lease of the mortgaged properties it came to an end on the payment of the zarpeshgi debt of Rs lent by <NAME> were in accordance with the agreement between <NAME> and <NAME> applied in paying off the zarpeshgi debt that on payment of that debt the zarpeshgi deed of the th November was handed over to <NAME> and that <NAME> when she lent her Rs It has also been held by this Board in <NAME> <NAME> I A that the ordinary rule is that a man having a right to act in either of two ways shall be assumed to have acted according to his interests In the last mentioned case it was held by this Board that the purchaser of an equity of redemption in immovable property situated in India who having notice of a second mortgage paid off a first mortgage upon the property without an assignment of the first mortgage to him must be assumed according to the rule of justice equity and good conscience to have intended to keep the first mortgage alive and consequently was entitled to stand in the place of the first mortgagee and to retain possession against the second mortgagee until repayment Their Lordships cannot find that a formal transfer of a mortgage is ever made or an intention to keep it alive ever formally expressed And their Lordships in that case held that the obvious question to ask in the interests of justice equity and good conscience is what was the intention of the party paying off the charge What this <ORG> said in as to the art of conveyancing in India and the practice in such cases is true as to the art of conveyancing and the practice in such cases at the present day Applying the rule of justice equity and good conscience their Lordships in this appeal hold that the charge created by the zarpeshgi deed of the th of November was kept alive for the benefit of <NAME> It is not alleged that <NAME> when he brought his suit had not notice that <NAME> was a person having an interest in the property comprised in the mortgage upon which he was suing If <NAME> had taken the ordinary precaution of inspecting the register of the district in which Fatehpur Lawaech is situate before he took his mortgage of the th of January he would have found that the annas pies share in Fatehpur Lawaech had been charged by the zarpeshgi deed of the th of November It has been contended that Section of the Transfer of Property Act did not apply to the suit which <NAME> brought the contention being that that section does not apply to a suit for sale of an equity of redemption and that a puisne mortgagee is not a person having an interest in the property comprised in a mortgage of a first or any prior mortgagee who brings a suit for sale on his prior mortgage That contention if correct would as it appears to their Lordships lead to the conclusion that neither a prior nor a subsequent mortgagee need be made a defendant to a suit for sale by a mortgagee of the specific lands included in his mortgage Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that the decree of <ORG> so far as it operated as a dismissal of the plaintiffs suit for sale of the annas and pies share in <ORG> and dismissed with costs in <ORG> and in <ORG> the plaintiffs suit as against <NAME> and <NAME> should be varied by decreeing that the plaintiffs appellants here by payment to the legal representatives of <NAME> or into <ORG> to their credit within ninety days from the tiling of His Majesty order in <ORG> of the amount of principal and interest in respect of which the annas pies share in <ORG> was sold to <NAME> under the decree of <NAME> in the suit of the th of September may redeem the mortgage of the th of January and may bring the annas pies share to sale for the balance then remaining due of the amount of principal and interest decreed by the Subordinate Judge in this suit by decreeing that the plaintiffs shall have proportionate costs of the suit in <ORG> and the appeal to <ORG> in respect of their claim against the annas pies share in <ORG> and the defendants <NAME> and <NAME> the amount of such costs to be ascertained by <ORG> and any costs paid by the appellants to <NAME> and <NAME> or his legal representatives or any of them shall be repaid to the plaintiffs and that in all other respects the decree of <ORG> be affirmed but that there shall be no costs of this appeal
