The question which <ORG> has referred to us for decision is Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the disallowance of the claims in the sum of Rs The material facts are that the assessee is a private limited company engaged in the business of manufacture of textiles at Bhopal being the amount set apart as a reserve fund in its balance sheet as on th February for the payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under Section of the Factories Act on account of the compensation it may be required to pay under Section of the Industrial Disputes Act to those of its workmen who may he retrenched in the following year The assessee obviously made the claim under Clause xv of Section of the Indian Income tax Act It has further been held in that case that the income tax law makes a distinction between an actual liability in praesenti and a liability de futuro which for the time being is only contingent and that the former is deductible but not the latter In that case <ORG> has quoted with approval the statement contained in paragraph at page of Simon Income tax which is as follows In computing the profits of a trade it is the normal accountancy practice to allow as an expense any sum in respect of liabilities which have accrued over the accounting period and to make a deduction of such sums from the profits For income tax purposes it was held that a distinction must be drawn between an actual i legal liability which is deductible and a liability which is future or contingent and for which no deduction can be made Till these circumstances arise the liability that rests on the employer to pay to a worker wages in accordance with Section for leave period remains a contingent liability which the employer may or may not be called upon to discharge That being so any sum set apart by an employer in any year for meeting the contingency of some of his workers going on leave the next year cannot be regarded as a permissible expenditure under Section xv of the Indian Income tax Act which it had debited to its expenses account the assessee claimed that this amount was allowable to it because it had incurred a liability for a corresponding amount to the employees on account of holiday wages which would have to be paid to them sometime in the following year in accordance with Section of the Factories Act <ORG> agreed with the Tribunal that the assessee was not entitled to the deduction claimed both for the reason that no expenditure had been actually incurred and also for the reason that the amount could not be claimed even as an account representing a certain liability After examining the provisions of Section of the Factories Act the learned Chief Justice of <ORG> said It should be clear from what I have stated above that such statutory liability for holiday wages as the Factories Act creates is only a contingent liability which may or may not have to be discharged and secondly the measure of that liability can never be known in advance It cannot be so known because it cannot be known in advance how many employees will avail themselves or how many holidays and when and necessarily at what rate holdiay wages would be payable In these circumstances it is perfectly clear that not only is the amount claimed not allowable as an item of expenditure because in fact no expenditure had been incurred and not a pice had gone out of the funds of the company but also that the amount does not even represent a certain liability which will have to be discharged in any event It may be that although a particular amount is not actually expended during the currency of a particular accounting year the assessee will still be entitled to a deduction if a certain liability for its payment has arisen so that it may be said that the expenditure is as good as made The amount claimed in the present case is certainly not even of that character and as I have already pointed out it is not an amount which was actually spent Thus it was held by <ORG> that the liability under Section of the Factories Act to pay holiday wages depended on the arising of the circumstances specified therein and since they might or might not arise the liability was only a contingent and uncertain liability which might or might not have to be discharged As there is no material difference between Section of the Factories Act and Section of the Factories Act the decision of <ORG> must be taken as supporting the view that the liability of an employer under Section of the Factories Act to pay to his workers holiday wages is a contingent liability It is plainly impossible for an employer to say in advance the number of employees he will be required to retrench at a subsequent point of lime having regard to the state of business then existing When therefore in any year of account the assessee claims a deduction of a sum which he may be required to pay as retrenchment compensation the next year or sometime later then the deduction that is claimed is not on account of a liability in praesenti but on account of a liability which may arise in future on the happening of a particular contingency <NAME> learned counsel for the assessee relied on a decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> AC ITR to support his contention that the possibility of retrenchment being effected in any running business was something which was usual and ordinarily incidental to the carrying on the business that it was not a remote possibility and that therefore if under Section of the Industrial Disputes Act a particular compensation on a particular basis had to be paid to the retrenched staff then a provision made for payment of the anticipated retrenchment compensation would only amount to making a provision for meeting a liability in praesenti and not a contingent liability In that case there was a statutory obligation on an English Company operating in Peru to pay compensation on the termination of services of its employees depending on the length of service subject however to certain contingencies where the employee would forfeit the benefits It was contended by the <ORG> that no deduction could be made there since there was no liability till the employees retired and that the whole of the compensation was deductible in the year of payment The deduction claimed by the assessee was however disallowed on the ground that in calculating the amount which it claimed to deduct in each year the assessee had ignored the factor of discount and the estimation made by it was not reasonable The decision in the case of <ORG> AC ITR supra is distinguishable by the fact that here the assessee is not under any definite obligation in any relevant year to pay to its employees any retrenchment compensation the liability to pay retrenchment compensation depends on the existence and fulfilment of certain conditions and that makes the assessee prospective liability contingent until the services of any employees arc terminated by way of retrenchment The principle laid down by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> AC ITR supra is therefore not applicable to the present case For the foregoing reasons our answer to the question referred to us for decision is in the affirmative The assessee shall pay costs of this reference
