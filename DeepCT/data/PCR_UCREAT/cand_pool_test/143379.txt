Being aggrieved the appellant challenged the order of the Chief Minister in a writ petition before the <ORG> contending that respondent No had participated in the auction and made false allegations against the appellant and without giving him any opportunity the offer of respondent No was accepted which has denied equality of opportunity to the appellant in the matter of distribution of the <ORG> largesse Being aggrieved the appellant filed an appeal to this Court and during is hearing filed an affidavit that if the Court orders re auction and if the highest bid falls short of Rs i The Court has imposed a restraint in its own wisdom on its exercise of jurisdiction under Article where the party invoking the jurisdiction has an effective adequate alternative remedy It does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court It is made specifically clear where the order complained against is alleged to be illegal or invalid as being contrary to law a petition at the instance of a person adversely affected would lie to the <ORG> under Article and such a petition cannot be rejected on the ground that an appeal lies to the higher officer or <ORG> In the instant case power was exercised by the authority set up under the rules to grant contract The <ORG> did not pose to itself the question who would grant the relief when the impugned order is passed at the instance of a Chief Minister of the <ORG> i There is a clear distinction between the use and disposal of private property and socialist property Even though the <ORG> is not bound to accept the highest bid this proposition of law has to be read subject to the observation that it can be rejected on relevant and valid considerations one such being that the concession is to be given to a weaker section of the society who could not outbid the highest bidder A unilateral offer secretly made not correlated to any reserved price made by the fourth respondent after making false statement in the letter was accepted without giving any opportunity to the appellant either to raise the bid or to point out the falsity of the allegations made by the fourth respondent in the letter as also the inadequacy of his bid No opportunity was given to him either to raise the bid When it is said that even in administrative action the authority must act fairly it ordinarily means in accordance with the principles of natural justice variously described as fair play in action The writ petition filed by the present appellant succeeds The order of the Director of Industries dated May granting a quarry lease to <ORG> respondent No in respect of Serai Khawaja Plot No II Quarry except the area of Green Field colonies for the period ending with st March is quashed and set aside The fourth respondent is given time upto December to clear out from the area and this time is given to him as and by way of locus penitentae to wind up his affairs as far as the quarry involved in this appeal My learned colleague suddenly left the <ORG> and the doubt nagged me for some time whether one Judge alone can give the reasons In this background to give reasons which appealed to us though drawn up by one of us would any day provide a better choice than not to give reasons because it would always annoy and distress the party who lost the legal battle whether there are legal or logical reasons in support of the order or it is merely an arbitrary exercise of power The letter further proceeds to make an offer that if the contract for a period of five years is given to respondent No in respect of Sarai Khawaja Plot No it is willing to pay Rs per year The appellant challenged the action of the Chief Minister in Writ Petition No in the Punjab and Haryana High Court inter alia contending that those who formed the firm styled as <ORG> respondent No had participated in the auction and Then made false allegations against the appellant whose bid was the highest and without giving him any opportunity the offer of respondent No was accepted which has denied equality of opportunity to the appellant in the matter of distribution of <ORG> largesse A learned Single Judge issued a notice to the respondents calling upon them to show cause why rule nisi may not be issued In response to the notice respondent No appeared and contended that the petitioner had an alternative remedy and on this short ground the learned Single Judge rejected the writ petition Then he made a pertinent observation a interposing an objection when Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner was making his submissions He posed the further question that if at the time of re auction the highest bid does not reach upto Rs a for which the lease is granted to the fourth respondent would the <ORG> make good the loss Apart from the rhetoric of the question the issue raised was of primary importance Shock was induced by the fact that public property was squandered away for a song by persons in power who holds the position of trust Before we deal with the contentions let us have a look at the relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules Rule of the Rules provides that contracts for extraction of minor mineral may be granted by the <ORG> by auctioning or tendering for a maximum period of five years after which no extension shall be granted Sub rule provides that the amount to be paid annually by the contractor to the <ORG> shall be determined in auction or by tender to be submitted for acceptance by the authority competent to grant the contract Rule provides for notifying of the proposed auction on the notice board of the Director Mining Officers and at least in one newspaper having wide circulation in the locality nearest to the area in question in the regional language as also in the <ORG> Gazette where the party invoking the jurisdiction has an effective adequate alternative remedy It should be made specifically clear that where the order complained against is alleged to be illegal or invalid as being contrary to law a petition at the in stance of person adversely affected by it would lie to <ORG> under Art Power was exercised formally by the authority set up under the Rules to grant contract but effectively and for all practical purposes by the Chief Minister of the State The High <ORG> did not pose to itself the question who would grant relief when the impugned order is passed at the instance of the Chief Minister of the State There was no answer aud that by itself without anything more would be sufficient to set aside the judgment of <ORG> Act to mean building stores gravel ordinary clay ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes and any other mineral which <ORG> may by notification in <ORG> declare to be a minor mineral Therefore various decisions laying down that the Government is not bound to accept the highest bid to which our attention was drawn by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the fourth respondent are of no relevance in this case The <ORG> also observed that the Government had the right for good and sufficient reason not to accept the highest bid but even to prefer a tenderer other than the highest bidder The appellant has no grievance that even though his was the highest bid the same was not accepted nor Mr <NAME> on his behalf contends that the highest bid of the appellant was rejected on grounds which are either irrelevant or extraneous while upholding the order of <ORG> dated April allotting to the second respondent to lacs blazes annually for extraction of resin from the inaccessible chir forests in Poonch Reasi and Ramban Divisions of the State for a period of years on the terms and conditions set out in the order observed as under Where any governmental action fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness and public interest discussed above and is found to be wanting in the quality of reasonableness or lacking in the element of public interest it would be liable to be struck down as invalid It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the <ORG> cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the <ORG> such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest The <ORG> therefore cannot for example give a contract or sell or lease out its property For a consideration less than The highest that can be obtained for it unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so emphasis supplied At one stage it was observed that the Government is not free like an ordinary individual in selecting recipient for its largesse and it cannot choose to deal with any person it pleases in its absolute and unfettered discretion Let it be made distinctly clear that respondent No was not selected for any special purpose or to satisfy ally Directive Principles of State Policy A unilateral offer secretly made not correlated to any reserved price made by the fourth respondent after making false statement in the letter was accepted Without giving any opportunity to the appellant either to raise the bid or to point out the falsity of the allegations made by the fourth respondent in the letter as also the inadequacy of his bid No opportunity was given to him either to raise the bid or to controvert and correct the erroneous statement What happened in this case must open the eyes both of the Government as well as the people at large Even though repeatedly this Court has said that the <ORG> is not bound to accept the highest bid this proposition of law has to be read subject to the observation that it can be rejected on relevant and valid considerations one such being that the concession is to be given to a weaker section of the society who could not outbid the highest bidder The appellant moved <ORG> for a writ of mandamus which was dismissed In appeal by the certificate it was urged on behalf of the <ORG> that the Deputy Commissioner acted within the ambit of his powers under the relevant rule which gave him an absolute discretion either to re auction or to act otherwise and no fetters are placed upon the otherwise method Here we have <NAME> who was present at the auction and who did not bid not that it would make any difference if he had for the fact remains that he made no attempt to outbid the appellant The procedure of tender was not open here because there was no notification and the furtive method adopted of setting a matter of this moment behind the backs of those interested and anxious to compete is unjustified But deeper considerations are also at stake namely the elimination of favouritism and nepotism and corruption not that we suggest that occurred here but to permit what has occurred in this case would leave the door wide open to the very evils which the <ORG> in its wisdom has endeavored to avoid A writ would therefore be ineffective and as it is not our practice to issue meaningless writs we must dismiss this appeal and leave the appellant content with an enunciation of the law lacs per year he quietly left the court frankly stating that he does not wish any contention to be raised on behalf of the State of Haryana the only distinguishing feature of the case being that the highest bid of the appellant was rejected and the contract was given to <ORG> a cooperative Society of the workmen Though the court did not so specifically state it upheld the rejection of the highest bid of the appellant on the ground that the benefit of the concession was given to a cooperative society formed by the weaker section of the society and thereby it serves the public purpose as set out in Art <NAME> <NAME> speaking for himself and <NAME> <NAME> Observe as under A pragmatic approach to social justice compel us to interpret constitutional provisions including those like Articles and with a view to see that effective policing of the corridors of power is carried out by the court until other ombudsman arrangements a problem with which <ORG> has been wrestling for too long emerges Proceeding along it was submitted that if that is accepted and if it appears to the court that the State of Haryana did not appear to have full appreciation of the value of the property and the other party i respondent No by reason of its profession was aware of the same and the resulting transaction is materially unfair then such a case falls outside the principle enunciated by the decision of this court on which reliance was placed on behalf of the respondent No If the allegations made in the letter influenced the decision of the Chief Minister fair plan in action demands that the appellant should have been given an opportunity to counter and correct the same When it is said that even in administrative action the authority must act fairly it ordinarily means in accordance with the principles of natural justice variously described as fair play in action That having not been done the grant in favour of the fourth respondent must be quashed
