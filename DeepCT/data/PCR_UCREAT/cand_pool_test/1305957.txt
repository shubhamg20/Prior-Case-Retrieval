DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> JUDGMENT I CIVIL APPEAL NOS OF SINHA These appeals arising out of a judgment and order dated passed in Writ Petition No of by <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh Indore Bench involving similar questions of law and fact were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment The said dispute was referred for adjudication of <ORG> Indore by the State of Madhya Pradesh on the following questions Whether non regularisation of the Sub Engineers as per the listed enclosed is valid and proper If no then to which relief they are entitled and what directions should be given to the employer Whether it is valid and proper for not giving equal salary to these Sub Engineers like other Sub Engineers in accordance with the equal work If no then to which relief they are entitled and what directions should be given to the employer PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL The parties filed their respective pleadings before <ORG> and also adduced their respective evidences There is no difference in their work and the work of the employees of <ORG> As regard the application of the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act for short the Act and the Rules framed thereunder known as Industrial Employment Standing Order Rules for short the Rules it was observed that although there was no specific pleadings raised in this behalf by the Respondents therein nor any question having been referred to <ORG> by the State Government touching the said issue it committed an error in granting relief to them on the basis thereof on its own motion Despite the same <ORG> went into the question of applicability of the said Act and held that the Act and the Rules had no application As regard application of the doctrine of equal pay for equal work it was held to be not applicable as the Appellants were not entitled to absorption or classification in terms of the Act and the Rules SUBMISSIONS Dr <NAME> learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants in Civil Appeal No of and Mr <NAME> learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants in Civil Appeal No of took us through materials on records and contended that the Appellants herein became permanent employees of the Respondents having regard to the provisions contained in Section of the Act and Order i and vi of the Standard Standing Orders as set out in the Annexure appended to the Rules defining permanent employees and the temporary employees Placing reliance on several documents which have come into existence at a subsequent stage Dr <NAME> would contend that vacancies in fact had arisen after passing of the judgment of <ORG> and thus the services of the Appellants should be regularized thereagainst It was urged that the expression clear vacancies has to be read in the context of period for which the concerned workman was required to work namely six months The learned counsel would submit that the sufficient materials were brought on records to show that vacancies were available and as the Appellants worked for a period of more than six months they became permanent employees in terms of the Act Drawing our attention also to the pleadings as also the reliefs claimed for by the Appellants before <ORG> the learned counsel would contend that no contention was raised therein by the Appellants as regard their entitlement of permanency in terms of the provisions of the Act and the Rules It was urged that there does not exist any controversy that ODA was to continue before and as such the Appellants could not have been absorbed by the Respondent authority Section provides for constitution of development authorities service The question therefore which arises for consideration is as to whether they could lay a valid claim for regularization of their services Regularisation cannot be claimed as a matter of right All actions of the <ORG> must conform to the constitutional requirements JT SC a Division Bench of this Court opined No person illegally appointed or appointed without following the procedure prescribed under the law is entitled to claim that he should be continued in service In this situation we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order It was in fact held that as the Petitioners therein were not regularized in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations for regular appointments their services had to be terminated and as such there had been neither any arbitrary nor illegal action on the part of the respondents nor any violation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles and However having regard to the facts and circumstances of the said case some directions were issued presumably in terms of Article of the Constitution It appears that there existed a scheme for regularization and some directions were issued in terms thereof The Act as noticed hereinbefore clearly mandates that all posts should be sanctioned by <ORG> and all appointments to the said cadre must be made by <ORG> alone Had the appointments of the Appellants been made in terms of the provisions of the Adhiniyam and Rules framed thereunder the Respondent <ORG> was statutorily enjoined to make an offer of appointment in writing which was to be accepted by the Appellants herein It may be true that the Appellants had been later on put on a monthly salary but there is nothing on record to show as to how the same was done Permanent employee has been divided in two categories i who had been appointed against a clear vacancy in one or more posts as probationers and otherwise and ii whose name had been registered at muster roll and who has been given a ticket of permanent employee The only provision as regard recruitment of the employees is contained in Order which merely provides that the Manager shall within a period of six months lay down the procedure for recruitment of employees and notify it on the notice board on which Standing Orders are exhibited and shall send copy thereof to the Labour Commissioner For the purpose of this matter we would proceed on the basis that the Act is a special statute For the purpose of regularization which would confer on the concerned employee a permanent status there must exist a post We have noticed the provisions of the Act and the Rules No case was made out by the Appellants herein in their statements of claim that they became permanent employees in terms thereof There is also nothing on records to show that such a claim was put forward even in the demand raising the industrial dispute See also <ORG> <ORG> Vs <NAME> and Others SCC and <ORG> and Another Vs <NAME> and Others SCC It is furthermore evident that the persons appointed as daily wagers held no posts The witness examined on behalf of the Respondents although at one stage stated that the appointment letters had been issued to them upon going through the records brought with him however asserted that no such appointment letter was issued We have referred to the said fact only for the purpose of showing that it would not be correct to contend that the Appellants had no access to the said documents <ORG> even in a case where provisions of the Indian Evidence Act apply may presume or may not presume that if a party despite possession of the best evidence had not produced the same it would have gone against his contentions Presumption as to adverse inference for non production of evidence is always optional and one of the factors which is required to be taken into consideration in the background of facts involved in the lis It was within its jurisdiction to do so particularly having regard to the nature of the evidence adduced by the Respondent In any event in this case we have proceeded on the basis that the assertions of the Appellants as regard nature of their employment their continuance in the job for a long time are correct and as such the question as to whether any adverse inference should be drawn for alleged production of documents called for would take a back seat The burden was on the Appellants to establish that they had a right to invoke the said doctrine in terms of Article of the Constitution of India For the purpose of invoking the said doctrine the nature of the work and responsibility attached to the post are some of the factors which were bound to be taken into consideration The said decision has been noticed in <NAME> supfa CONCLUSION For the reasons aforementioned we do not find any merit in these appeals which are dismissed accordingly
