No cause was assigned for the termination of his services and no opportunity was given to him of showing cause against the action taken against him Claiming that he is a quasi permanent servant he brought a suit against the <ORG> alleging that the termination of his service was not justified The present appeal was filed on a certificate granted by <ORG> The first contention raised by the appellant was that he was a quasi permanent employee and of the Central Civil Service Temporary Service Rules did not apply to him This being the position since no declaration has been made in his case the appellant cannot claim the benefits of which places a quasi permanent servant and a permanent servant on the same footing in the matter of termination of service iii Where termination of service of a temporary <ORG> servant takes place as it has taken place in the present ease on the ground that his conduct is not satisfactory there cannot be any question of any discrimination iv Temporary <ORG> servants are also entitled to the protection of Art in the same manner as a permanent <ORG> servants if the <ORG> takes action against them by meting out one of the three punishments i dismissal removal or reduction in rank Held that when a preliminary enquiry is held to determine whether a prima facie case for a formal departmental enquiry is made out in the case of a temporary employee or a <ORG> servant holding a higher rank temporarily there is no question of its being governed by Art Held that even if a departmental enquiry against the appellant was contemplated it was not pursued and no punitive action was taken against him on the basis of the memorandum issued to him The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an appeal against the judgment and decree of <ORG> on a certificate granted by that Court No cause was assigned for the termination of his services and no opportunity was given to him of showing cause against the action taken against him He therefore brought a suit in <ORG> at Bombay and his contention was that his services had been terminated unjustifiably and maliciously as the Regional Director of Production in the Textile Commissioner office at Ahmedabad was against him The appellant went on to state in the plaint that certain enquiries were held against him behind his back but the matter was not pursued and he was transferred to Bombay in February There was also a claim for arrears of salary and costs of the suit and such other consequential reliefs as the court might deem fit to give It was also contended that was perfectly valid and that there was no discrimination practised against the appellant when his services were terminated It was also admitted that from December onwards some department inquiry was conducted against the appellant but it was averted that the said departmental inquiry was not pursued as the evidence against him was not considered to be conclusive On these pleadings three main questions arose for decision before the trial court namely i whether the appellant was a quasi permanent employee and of the Rules did not apply to him ii whether was invalid as it was hit by Art of the Constitution and in any case whether the action taken against the appellant was discriminatory and therefore hit by Art The appellant then applied for a certificate to appeal to this <ORG> which was granted and that is how the matter has come up before us If the appellant is held to be a quasi permanent employee he will be entitled to the protection of Art were not complied with in the present case his suit would have to be decreed and no further question would arise for decision Rule of the Rules which falls for consideration in this connection is as follows A Government servant shall be deemed to be in quasi permanent service i if he has been in continuous Government service for more than three years ii if the appointing authority being satisfied as to his suitability in respect of age qualifications work and character for employment in a quasi permanent capacity has issued a declaration to that effect in accordance with such instructions as the Governor General may issue from time to time who had come to India on account of the Partition This protection was afforded to temporary government servants and the government servants of the other type by the device of creating quasi permanent service It is however urged that the definitions in have to be read subject to there being nothing repugnant in the subject or context and it is contended that in the context of the two sub clauses must be read disjunctively We are of opinion that there is no force in this argument and as a matter of fact the context of itself requires that rule must be read in harmony with the definition of quasi permanent service in for it could not possibly be the intention of the rule making authority to create disharmony between the definition in and the provision in Therefore the protection of can only be given to a quasi permanent employee after a declaration has been made Otherwise if the two sub clauses of were to be read disjunctively the result would be that a person may become a quasi permanent employee under sub cl If he could claim the benefit of he would have been certainly entitled to the protection of Art In short gives power to the <ORG> to terminate the services of a temporary government servant by giving him one month notice or on payment of one month pay in lieu of notice or such shorter or longer notice or payment in lieu thereof as may be agreed to between the <ORG> and the employee concerned which provides that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> These Rules show that there are two classes of employees namely i permanent employees and ii temporary employees the latter being divided into two sub clauses a quasi permanent and temporary It has been urged on behalf of the respondent that Art We are of opinion that there is no force in this contention We shall deal with the question whether termination in this case is liable to be set aside on the ground that Art It would be absurd to say that if the service of one temporary servant is terminated on the ground of unsatisfactory conduct the services of all similar employees must also be terminated along with him irrespective of what their conduct is Therefore even though some of those mentioned in the plaint by the appellant were junior to him and did not have as good qualifications as he had and were retained in service it does not follow that the action taken against the appellant terminating his services was discriminatory for that action was taken on the basis of his unsatisfactory conduct A question of discrimination may arise in a case of retrenchment on account of abolition of one of several temporary posts of the same kind in one office but can in our opinion never arise in the case of dispensing with the services of a particular temporary employee on account of his conduct being unsatisfactory We therefore reject the contention that the appellant was denied the protection of Art We now come to the last question whether the appellant Was entitled to the protection of Art It is well settled that temporary servants are also entitled to the protection of Art It is also not disputed that the mere use of expressions like terminate or discharge is not conclusive and in spite of the use of such innocuous expressions the court has to apply the two tests mentioned in <NAME> case namely whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences and if either of the tests is satisfied it must be held that the servant had been punished Further even though misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or the inducing factor which influences the <ORG> to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule nevertheless if a right exists under the contract or the rules to terminate the service the motive operating on the mind of the <ORG> is wholly irrelevant It is on these principles which have been laid down in <NAME> case that we have to decide whether the appellant was entitled to the protection of Art Before however we consider the facts of this case we should like to make certain general observations in connection with disciplinary proceedings taken against public servants It is well known that government does not terminate the services of a public servant be he even a temporary servant without reason nor is it usual for government to reduce a public servant in rank without reason even though he may be holding the higher rank only temporarily In that case there is nothing further to be said and his services terminate when the post comes to an end But even where it is intended to take action by way of punishment what usually happens is that something in the nature of what may be called a preliminary enquiry is first held in connection with the alleged misconduct or unsatisfactory work It is usual when such a preliminary enquiry makes out a prima facie case against the servant concerned that charges are then framed against him and he is asked to show cause why disciplinary action be not taken against him In this enquiry evidence both documentary and oral may be led against the public servant concerned and he has a right to cross examine the witnesses tendered against him He has also the right to give documentary and oral evidence in his defence if he thinks necessary to do so After the enquiry is over the enquiry officer makes a report to the <ORG> or the authority having power to take action against the servant concerned The servant concerned has then an opportunity of showing cause by making a represen tation that the conclusions arrived at the departmental enquiry are incorrect and in any case the punishment proposed to be inflicted is too harsh Generally therefore a preliminary enquiry is usually held to determine whether a prima facie case for a formal departmental enquiry is made out and it is very necessary that the two should not be confused Even where government does not intend to take action by way of punishment against a temporary servant on a report of bad work or misconduct a preliminary enquiry is usually held to satisfy government that there is reason to dispense with the services of a temporary employee or to revert him to his substantive post for as we have said already government does not usually take action of this kind without any reason Therefore so far as the preliminary enquiry is concerned there is no question of its being governed by Art for that enquiry is really for the satisfaction of government to decide whether punitive action should be taken or action should be taken under the contract or the rules in the case of a temporary government servant or a servant holding higher rank temporary to which he has no right But at that stage he has no right to be heard for the enquiry is merely for the satisfaction of the Government and it is only when the government decides to hold a regular departmental enquiry for the purposes of inflicting one of the three major punishments that the government servant gets the protection of Art In <NAME> case what happened was that the government servant concerned was called upon to explain certain matters which cast an imputation upon him but later it was made perfectly clear to him by the government that it was not holding any formal departmental enquiry against him with a view to inflicting any of the three major punishments although the government desired to give him an opportunity to show cause why he should not be compul sorily retired and after considering his explanation he was compulsorily retired under the relevant service rule It was held in that case that this did not amount to punishment within the meaning of Art even though there was some imputation at an earlier stage and even though the servant concerned was asked to explain why he should not be compulsorily retired As we have said already it is not usual for government to take action against a public servant without rhyme or reason and that is why in the case of temporary servants or servants holding higher ranks to which they have no right some kind of preliminary enquiry is usually held before the government decides to dispense with their set vice or revert them to their substantive posts would depend upon facts of each case and the action taken by government which finally leads to the termination of service Let us now turn to the facts of this case It may be conceded that the way in which the memorandum was drafted and the fact that in the last sentence he was asked to state why disciplinary action should not be taken against him might give an impression that the intention was to hold a formal departmental enquiry against him with a view to punishing him It seems therefore clear that though this memorandum was issued and the appellant was asked therein to state why disciplinary action should not be taken against him no departmental enquiry followed that memorandum and the matter was dropped On these facts there can in our opinion be no doubt that even if a departmental enquiry was contemplated in December it was not pursued and no punitive action was taken against him on the basis of the memorandum issued to him on December what appears to have happened is that after the appellant was transferred to Bombay where he worked for six months more the government came to the conclusion that his work and conduct were not satisfactory and therefore decided to terminate his services under We cannot accept the proposition that once government issues a memorandum like that issued in this case on December but later decides not to hold a departmental enquiry for taking punitive action it can never thereafter proceed to take action against a temporary government servant in the terms of even though it is satisfied otherwise that his conduct and work are unsatisfactory This is exactly what happened in the present case and it was more than six months after that the appellant who had in the meantime been transferred to Bombay was discharged in the terms of because his work and conduct were found unsatisfactory The order terminating his services makes no imputation whatsoever against him and in the circumstances it cannot be said that the termination of his service is visited with any evil consequences as explained in <NAME> case Further the charge sheet in <NAME> case besides asking him to state why disciplinary action should not be taken against him also asked him to state in his reply if he wanted to be heard in person and wanted to put forward any defence which clearly showed that a departmental enquiry was going to be held particularly when the charges were given by the Settlement Officer who had apparently been appointed the enquiry officer for the purpose The enquiry officer found <NAME> guilty of the charges and recommended that he should be removed from service immediately On the basis of this report an order was passed by the Deputy Commissioner which stated in so many words that it had been established that bribes had been taken by <NAME> and that he accepted the report of the Settlement Officer Obviously in that case a departmental enquiry was held by the enquiry officer a report was made to the Deputy Commissioner who was apparently the authority to dismiss or remove <NAME> and he passed the order terminating his services on the basis of the report though he did not use the word dismiss or remove in his order As we have already pointed out no departmental enquiry was really held after the memorandum of December in this case and no enquiry officer was appointed and no report was made by any enquiry officer It is the third proposition therein on which strong reliance has been placed on behalf of the appellant It is in these terms But if instead of terminating such a person service without any enquiry the employer chooses to hold an enquiry into his alleged misconduct or inefficiency or for some similar reason the termination of service is by way of punishment because it puts a stigma on his competence and thus affects his future career In such a case he is entitled to the protection of Art it is urged on behalf of the appellant that this proposition means that as soon as any kind of enquiry is held against a probationer and the same it is said will apply to a temporary employee as the two A I In that case the <ORG> after some kind of enquiry said in the order terminating the services of the servant concerned that confidential enquiries showed that he had the reputation of being a corrupt officer and that there was ample material to show that the report about his resorting to corrupt practices was justified was applicable in that case and that is why some enquiries were held and a provisional conclusion to terminate the services of the officer concerned was arrived at and he was asked to show cause against that The third proposition therefore in that case does not in our opinion lay down that as soon as any kind of enquiry is held into the conduct of a probationer or a temporary servant he is immediately entitled to the protection of Art This Court in <NAME> case referred to the rules which provided that where it is proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer whether during or at the end of the period of probation for any specific fault or on account of his unsuitability for the service the probationer shall be apprised of the grounds of such proposal and given an opportunity to show cause against it before orders are passed by the authority competent to terminate the employment and pointed out that action in accordance with the rules would not be hit by Art
