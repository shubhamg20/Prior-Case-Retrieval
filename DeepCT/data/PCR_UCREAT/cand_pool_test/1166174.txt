But it did not pay the amount collected to the <ORG> The main contention of the appellant before <ORG> was that of the Act which authorises the <ORG> to recover a tax collected without the authority of law was beyond the competence of <ORG> because a tax collected without the authority of law would not be a tax levied under the law and it would therefore not be open to the <ORG> to collect under the authority of a law enacted under the Entry of List II of the VII Schedule to the Constitution any such amount as it was not a tax on sale or purchase of goods Held i It cannot be said that <ORG> was directly legislating for the imposition of sales or purchase tax under Entry list II when it made the provisions of a for on the face of the provisions the amount though collected by way of tax was not exigible as tax under the law Even so there is a limit to such incidental or ancillary powers These have to be exercised in aid of the than topic of legislation which in the present case is a tax on sale or purchase of goods The ambit of ancillary or incidental powers does not so to the extent of permitting the legislature to provide that though the amount collected may be wrongly by way of tax is not exigible under the law as made under the relevant taxing entry it shall still be paid over to the Govern ment as if it were a tax There is no element of regulation of trade and commerce in a provision like and therefore that section cannot be justified under Entry The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> an appeal by special leave against the order of <ORG> The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> questioning the validity of of the Hyderabad General Sales Tax Act No XIV of hereinafter referred to as the Act When the accounts were scrutinized by <ORG> this was discovered and thereupon the appellant was called upon to pay the amounts realised to the <ORG> The main contention raised on behalf of the appellant in <ORG> was that of the Act which authorised the <ORG> to recover from any person who had collected or collects after May any amount by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with The argument was that the Act was passed under Entry of List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which enables the State legislature to enact a law taxing transactions of sale or purchase of goods The entry therefore vests power in the State legislature to make a law for taxing sales and pur chases of goods and for making all necessary incidental provisions in that behalf for the levy and collection of sales or purchase tax But it was urged that that entry did not empower the State legislature to enact a law by which a dealer who may have collected a tax without authority is required to hand over the amount to <ORG> as any collection without the authority of law would not be a tax levied under the law and it would therefore not be open to the State to collect under the authority of a law enacted under Entry of List II any such amount as it was not a tax on sale or purchase of goods <ORG> having refused a certificate to appeal to this Court the appellant obtained special leave and that is how the matter has come up be fore us It is necessary to read II of the Act in order to appre ciate the point urged on behalf of the appellant Notwithstanding to the contrary contained in any order of an officer or tribunal or judgment decree or order of a Court every person who has collected or collects on or before st May any amount by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall pay over to the Government within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed the amount so collected by him That provision however does not apply in the present case for the appellant is admittedly a registered dealer It applies to collections made after May by any person whether a registered dealer or otherwise and lays down that any amount collected by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act shall be paid over to the Government and in default of such payment the said amount shall be recovered from such person as if it were arrears of land revenue It is clear from the words other wise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act that though the amount may have been collected by way of tax it was not exigible as tax under the Act Section thus provides that amounts collected by way of tax though not exigible as tax under the Act shall be paid over to Government and if not paid over they shall be recovered from such person as if they were arrears of land revenue Clearly therefore as it stands provides for recovery of an amount collected by way of tax as arrears of land revenue though the amount was not due as tax under the Act The first question therefore that falls for consideration is whether it was open to the State legislature under its powers under Entry of List II to make a provision to the effect that money collected by way of tax even though it is not due as a tax under the Act shall be made over to Government So it cannot be said that the State legislature was directly legislating for the imposition of sales or purchase tax under Entry of List II when it made such a provision for on the face of the provision the amount though collected by way of tax The provision however is attempted to be justified on the ground that though it may not be open to a State legislature to make provision for the recovery of an amount which is not a tax under Entry of List in a law made for that purpose it would still be open to the legislature to provide for paying over all the amounts collected by way of tax by persons even though they really are not exigible as tax as part of the incidental and ancillary power to make provision for the levy and collection of such tax Now there is no dispute that the heads of legislation in the various Lists in the Seventh Schedule should be interpreted widely so as to take in all matters which are of a character incidental to the topics mentioned therein Even so there is a limit to such incidental or ancillary power flowing from the legislative entries in the various Lists in the Seventh Schedule But where the legislation under the relevant entry proceeds on the basis that the amount concerned is not a tax exigible under the law made under that entry but even so lays down that though it is not exigible under the law it shall be paid over to Government merely because some dealers by mistake or otherwise have collected it as tax it is difficult to see how such provision can be ancillary or incidental to the collection of tax legitimately due under a law made under the relevant taxing entry We do not think that the ambit of ancillary or incidental power goes to the extent of permitting the legislature to provide that though the amount collectedmay be wrongly by way of tax is not exigible under the law as made under the relevant taxing entry it shall still be aid over to Government as if it were a tax But as we read we cannot find anything in it to justify that it is a penalty for breach of any prohibition in the Act Section in our opinion has nothing to do with penalties and cannot be justified as a penalty on the dealer We are therefore of opinion that cannot be justified under Entry of List II either as a provision for levying the tax or as an incidental or ancillary provision relating to the collection of tax In this connection we may refer to cl of which provides that any person who fails to pay the amounts specified in sub section of section within the prescribed time shall on a conviction by a Magistrate be liable to fine It does not provide for a penalty collecting the amount wrongly by way of tax from purchasers which may have been justified as a penalty for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the taxing legislation That case in our opinion has no application to the facts of the present case <ORG> allowed the petition in part and there were appeals to this Court both by the dealer and the <ORG> If it cannot be so justified as we hold that it cannot we are unable to uphold it as regulating trade and commerce under Entry of List II There is in our opinion no element of regulation of trade and commerce in a provision like We therefore allow the appeal and quash the assessment order dated September insofar as it is based on II
