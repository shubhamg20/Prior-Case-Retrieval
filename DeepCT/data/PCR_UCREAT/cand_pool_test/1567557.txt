The suit was originally instituted by the plaintiff claiming partition and possession of a four annas share of the lands specified in the plaint coupled with a claim for mesne profits in respect thereof from the date of dispossession to the date of the recovery of possession of the same The learned Judge granted a preliminary in a sense but final decree for partition and directed that the plaintiff was entitled to possession of his share of the lands so partitioned and against that decree no appeal has been preferred to this <ORG> and in so far as the relief sought and granted by that decree qua partition and possession the same has been effectually disposed of and finally determined On the th January the matter came before the learned Subordinate Judge who directed notice to issue to the opposite party to show cause why a supplementary decree under Order XX Rule of the Civil Procedure Code for the amount claimed by the plaintiff by way of mesne profits should not be granted and the learned Judge directed that the case should be put up for final disposal on the th February The matter came before the learned Subordinate Judge on the th January for final disposal on the Commissioner report and objection was taken before the learned Subordinate Judge as now before us to the following effect that the learned Subordinate Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the application presented on the th of July inasmuch as the previous petition or application for the assessment of mesne profits which was filed on the th January had been finally disposed of and dismissed by the lower Court order of the th March and that consequently the disposal of the application for mesne profits on the th of March was a disposal of all that was left remaining undisposed of in the original suit and that thus no suit was pending in July in which any subsequent application could be made It is conceded that the order of the th March was an order properly made within the provisions of Order IX Rule and that the learned Judge was justified in dismissing the application for assessment of <ORG> profits on the grounds he did and that the only available remedy open to the plaintiff against such order is that provided by Order IX Rule where under the plaintiff must elect to adopt one of the two courses either to abide by the order dismissing the application for assessment of <ORG> profits and bring a fresh sail or apply to set aside the order of dismissal and seek to have the application for an enquiry and assessment of <ORG> profits restored for hearing It is unnecessary for us to determine whether the plaintiff still has a right to pursue his remedy by independent suit to recover the mesne profits which he claims for the years to He summarises his conclusion in three lines in the following words In the second place it was not the suit but the application of the plaintiff for the determination of profits that was dismissed for default and so I do not think there is any bar to a fresh application of a similar nature an order almost similar in terms to that in the present case was made the difference only being that in the case cited the application for mesne profits was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff failed to deposit the necessary Commissioner fee incidental to the holding of the enquiry as to the assessment of mesne profits The learned Judge who heard the case originally by reason of the laches of the plaintiff in making the necessary payment directed that the Commissioner should return the commission and that the case should be dismissed for default on behalf of the plaintiff Now the learned Judges on appeal who decided that case Mr Justice <NAME> and Mr Justice <NAME> reviewed all the authorities with the greatest care and the learned Judges were of opinion that there was no room for controversy on the question raised for their decision and they held that once such an application for assessment of mesne profits was dismissed all that remained of the original suit was gone and must be deemed dismissed and that no fresh or subsequent application for assessment of mesne profits was entertain able The learned Judges say as follows The result was that on the th January the Court recorded an order to the effect that the Commissioner be directed to return the commission and that the case be dismissed for default on behalf of the plaintiff Now what was the case thus dismissed Clearly it was the claim of the plaintiff for recovery of mesne profits from the defendant as that case was dismissed on the th of January it was obviously not open to the plaintiff to make a fresh application on the th January because there was no pending suit wherein that application could be deemed to have been made The learned Judges then dealt in detail with all the decisions touching and concerning the point arising now for our determination and there seems to be general uniformity of opinion that once an application such as that in the present case was presented on the th of January and was dismissed on the th March that then the <ORG> ceased to have seisin of the case and that then no jurisdiction existed in the <ORG> to entertain any fresh application with regard to the assessment of mesne profits To the law so declared and laid down by the Judges of the Calcutta High <ORG> we beg respectfully to subscribe However having regard to the view we take on the question of law arising for our determination touching the invalidity of the decree of the learned Judge passed on the rd March it becomes unnecessary for us to determine the question arising with regard to the <ORG> fee payable Accordingly we allow this appeal and set aside the decree of the learned Subordinate Judge and direct that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant his costs in the lower Court and the costs of this appeal
