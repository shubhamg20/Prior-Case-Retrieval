The appellate Assistant Commissioner held that Mr <NAME> functioned in the dual capacity of a director of the assessee company and as an agent of <ORG> and that he was controlling the assessee company by exercising the voting rights in respect of the shares held by the foreign company as agent of the said company and not as a director of the assessee company and on that view he in agreement with the Income tax Officer treated the assessee as not a director controlled company within the meaning of Section of the Excess Profits Tax Act From this order there was an appeal to <ORG> The Tribunal held that in view of the power of attorney given to Mr <NAME> by the <ORG> there was no room for doubt that the respondent company was a director controlled company and set aside the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner The Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax thereupon asked the Tribunal to make a reference saying that the following question of law among others arose out of the order of the Tribunal Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on the construction of the power of attorney the <ORG> was right in holding that the assessee was a company the directors whereof had a controlling interest therein On behalf of the Commissioner a point was taken by Dr <NAME> that Article in the Articles of Association was ultra vires the Indian Companies Act and therefore was invalid and consequently the power of attorney given to Mr <NAME> was of no effect Counsel referred to Section of the Act which is as follows A company which is a member of another company may by resolution of the directors authorise any of its officials or any other person to act as its representative at any meeting of that other company and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the company which he represents as if he were an individual shareholder of that other company Applicants counsel Dr <NAME> said that Section of that Act had no application to the case of <ORG> He also pointed out that apart from Section there was no other provision in the Act which authorised <ORG> to give such a power of attorney and so the power given to Mr <NAME> was invalid It is true that Section does not apply and there is no provision in the Companies Act which expressly authorise the company to give such a power of attorney If this is so I do not see any reason why <ORG> could not give such a power of attorney to Mr <NAME> The point the applicant took before the <ORG> was not that the power was invalid but that on the true construction of the power given to Mr <NAME> he was not entitled to vote as a director in respect of the shares held by <ORG> There the applicant argued that by virtue of the power given to Mr <NAME> he could only vote as an agent of <ORG> and therefore the respondent company was not a director controlled company It must be remembered that the reference has been made under Section of the Indian Income tax Act We have been referred to a recent decision of <ORG> as an authority for the proposition that even if a point is not taken before the <ORG> such a point can be said to arise out of the order of the <ORG> We respectfully agree with the view expressed by <ORG> The only point therefore for our consideration is whether in view in of the fact that Mr <NAME> had a valid power of attorney from <ORG> to vote on the shares held by that company the respondent company can be said to be a director controlled company The question depends on the meaning to be given to the words controlling interest in Section No distinction can be made between the case when the director trustee has and when he has not a beneficial interest in the shares There were eight directors who were respectively beneficial owners and registered holders of ordinary shares which amounted to a total of shares but where they had no such interest only by per cent <ORG> affirming the decision of <ORG> held that on a true construction the words controlling interest did not refer to the directors beneficial interest in the company but to the power of controlling by votes the decisions binding on the company in the shape of resolutions passed at a general meeting Accordingly the directors were entitled to include the shares held by them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they had a controlling interest has been explained This view appears to me to agree with the object of the enactment as it appears on the face of the Act I find it impossible to adopt the view that a persons who by having the requisite voting power in a company subject to his will and ordering can make the ultimate decision as to where and how the business of the company shall be carried on and who thus has in fact control of the companys affairs is a person of whom it can be said that he has not in his contention got a controlling interest in the company Twenty shares were held by five persons as trustees one of them A being also a director <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> held that the interest of the trustees in the shares was interest within the meaning of the section and that as under the trust deed and also the Articles of Association of the company the trustee A had the right to vote as he pleased at a meeting as between the company and the shareholders he had a controlling interest in respect of the shares and the company therefore was a director controlled company within the meaning of the section The section does not make any reference to any register There is nothing in the section to show that such control must be brought about by directors having a majority of votes on the register
