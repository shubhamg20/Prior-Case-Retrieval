<NAME> <NAME> AGRAWAL The short question that falls for consideration in this appeal is whether it is permissible to club vacancies of a number of years while preparing the select list for promotion to <ORG> for short Service from <ORG> By the impugned judgment dated November <ORG> Ahmedabad Bench hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal has held that such clubbing of vacancies is not permissible and that separate select lists should be prepared by <ORG> for each year He filed a petition A NO OF before the <ORG> wherein he assailed the select list prepared by <ORG> in December January on the ground that it was not permissible to club together the vacancies of the years to for the purpose of making selection under Regulation of the Regulations and that <ORG> should have met every year to prepare a select list for the vacancies of each year The <ORG> has held that the action of the appellants in clubbing the vacancies and thereby enlarging the zone of consideration could have prejudiced the respondent and therefore it was illegal The <ORG> has directed the appellant to prepare select list from year to year from to and thereafter on the basis of vacancies from year to year without clubbing the vacancies in any particular year and as the part of the exercise to consider the case of the respondent for promotion to the Service and should has name figure in the select list and should the vacancies permit to appoint him to the Service and to give him all consequential benefits on the basis of such appointment from the date of the appointment Feeling aggrieved by the said decision of the <ORG> the appellant has filed this appeal The number of members of <ORG> included in the list shall not be more than twice the number of substantial vacancies anticipated in the course of the period of twelve months commencing from the date of preparation of the list in the posts available for them under Rule of the Recruitment Rules or percent of the Senior posts shown against items and of the cadre schedule of each State of group of States whichever is greater The Committee shall consider for inclusion in the said list the cases of members of <ORG> in the order of a seniority in that Service or a member which is equal to five times the number referred in sub regulation Provided also that in respect of any released Emergency Commissioned or short service Commissioned Officers appointed to <ORG> eight years of continuous service as required under the preceding proviso shall be counted from the deemed date of their appointment to that service subject to the condition that such officers shall be eligible for consideration if they have completed not less than four years of actual continuous service on the first day of the January of the year in which the committee meets in the post of Deputy Collector or in any other post or posts declared equivalent thereto by <ORG> A The <ORG> shall not consider the cases of the members of <ORG> who have attained the age of years on the first day of January of the year in which it meets Provided that a member of <ORG> whose name appears in the Select List in force immediately before the date of the meeting of the <ORG> shall be considered for inclusion in the fresh list to be prepared by the <ORG> even if he has in the meanwhile attained the age of years In clause the words years were substituted by the words years and the second proviso was inserted The said clause also required that the number of the members of <ORG> included in the list shall not be more than twice the number of substantive vacancies anticipated in the course of the period of twelve months commencing from the date of preparation of the list If clause is read with the other provisions in Regulation referred to above the inference is inevitable that the requirement in clause of Regulation that <ORG> shall meet at intervals not exceeding one year and prepare a list of members of <ORG> who are suitable for promotion in the Service was intended to be mandatory in nature because the eligibility of the persons to be considered both in the matter of length of service and are under clauses and is with reference to the first date of January of the year in which <ORG> meets and the number of members of <ORG> to be considered for selection is also linked with the number of substantive vacancies anticipated in the course of the period of twelve months commencing from the date of preparation of the list In Regulation there was a requirement that the <ORG> shall meet at intervals not exceeding one year and consider the cases of all substantive members of <ORG> who on the first day of January of the year had completed not less than eight years of continuous service Under Regulation it was prescribed that the <ORG> shall not consider the case of members of <ORG> who had attained the age of years on the first day of the January of the year in which the meeting of the <ORG> is held It only means that unless there are good reasons for not doing so <ORG> shall meet every year for making the selection This Court in <NAME> case held that the <ORG> shall prepare every year the select list and the list must be submitted to the <ORG> by <ORG> for approval and thereafter appointment shall be made in accordance with the rules We have therefore no hesitation to hold that preparation of the select list every year is mandatory It would subserve the object of the Act and the rules and afford an higher opportunity to the promotee officers to reach higher echelons of the service It must therefore held that in view of the provisions contained in Regulation unless there is a good reason for not doing so <ORG> is required to meet every year for the purpose of making the selection from amongst <ORG> officers who fulfill the conditions regarding eligibility on the first day of the January of the year in which the <ORG> meets and fall within the zone of consideration as prescribed in clause of Regulation The failure on the part of <ORG> to meet during a particular year would not dispense with the requirement of preparing the Select List for that year There was thus a failure to comply with the mandatory requirement of Regulation of the Regulations In the instant case <ORG> officers who were selected in the select list prepared in December January have not been impleaded as parties and therefore their appointment to the <ORG> cannot be upset Therefore while upholding the judgement of the <ORG> that the respondent is entitled to seek fresh consideration on the basis that the selection should be made for vacancies occurring in each year separately but in substitution of the directions given by the <ORG> in the regard the following directions are given The number of vacancies falling in the quota prescribed for promotion of <ORG> officers to the Service shall be determined separately for each year in respect of the period from to
