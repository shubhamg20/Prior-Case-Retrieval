JUDGMENT I A Nos SLP Nos A Nos SLP Nos <NAME> PATIL Since common question of law arises for consideration on similar facts these appeals and special leave petitions are disposed of by this judgment A preliminary notification under Section of the Land Acquisition Act for short the Act was issued on th June under Section declaration was made on and two awards were passed covering the entire area on and awarding a sum of Rs In all Regular First Appeals were filed in <ORG> by the claimants as well as the <ORG> of Haryana against the judgment of <ORG> The learned Single Judge having reviewed and re appreciated the entire evidence keeping in view the contention of the parties for the reasons stated in the judgment reduced the amount of compensation to Rs per square yard <ORG> dismissed the appeals affirming the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge Learned counsel representing the appellants strongly contended that applying cut of on the rate of compensation arrived at on the basis of the sale instances is neither justified nor tenable <ORG> was not right in reducing the rate of compensation from Rs per square yard to Rs per square yard the <ORG> in pursuance of the award of the District Judge raised the rate of allotment of the land to Rs per square yard as a result of which total rate of allotment of land worked out to more than Rs per square yard and as such there was no loss to the <ORG> or the <ORG> so as to ask the appellant to pay back of the amount of compensation already received according to the learned counsel if refund is to be made by the appellants it amounts to unjust enrichment for the <ORG> which has already received more money by way of increase in the rate of land from the allottees He submitted that the judgment of the learned Single Judge is based on the finding of facts which <ORG> of <ORG> has affirmed and as such the impugned order does not call for any interference at the hands of this Court The learned Single Judge dealing with the question of location and potentiality of the acquired land has observed that there is really not much dispute between the parties in that regard documents clearly show that the land in question is adjacent to the land already acquired for developing Sectors and on one side of the acquired land there is a city railway station while on the other there is ft wide road there is overwhelming documentary evidence to show that the land in question is surrounded by developed areas and the land has a commercial and residential potentiality The learned counsel for the appellants pointing out to these observations urged that there was no need to apply any cut on the amount of compensation based on the market value After noticing the observations made in the judgment of the learned Single Judge <ORG> concurred with the findings recorded therein and upheld the cut applied by the learned Single Judge on the compensation amount payable to the claimants The <ORG> has to carry out and incur heavy expenditure for developing the land which has now been acquired and as such there was justification to apply cut The learned Single Judge following the earlier decisions of this <ORG> and of the same High <ORG> determined the market value of the acquired land having regard to the evidence placed on record and applied cut in arriving at the amount of compensation to be paid to the claimants This land comprising of large area is not developed although it has potential value for residential and commercial purposes Thus after leaving the area in the land required for the purposes mentioned above plots were to be made for residential and commercial purposes by incurring expenditure for other developmental works such as providing electricity water etc However in cases of some land where there are certain advantages by virtue of the developed area around may help in reducing the percentage of cut to be applied as the developmental charges required may be less on that account There may be various factual factors which may have to be taken into consideration while applying the cut in payment of compensation towards developmental charges may be in some cases it is more than and in some cases less than It must be remembered that there is difference between a developed area and an area having potential value which is yet to be developed It is also observed the mere fact that there is a connecting road to the lands by itself is not a correct principle of law in refusing to deduct towards developmental charges It appears to us having regard to facts and circumstances of the case that <ORG> has applied cut of as against the normal deduction In order to convert the land into plots for the purpose of construction of residential and commercial buildings certain area was to be earmarked for the abovementioned purposes in accordance with the law governing in the matter of creating layouts in addition to incurring of expenditure for the development area Having regard to all these aspects we find no merit in these appeals Parties to bear their own costs
