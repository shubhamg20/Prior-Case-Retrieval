would be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs on th July and the remaining amount would be paid by annual instalments of Rs The decree further provided that in case of default of two consecutive instalments the defendants will pay the whole of the balance remaining unpaid to the plaintiffs On th September the decree holders filed an application for execution out of which this appeal arises giving credit for two sums of Rs On th October the defendants filed an objection denying that they had made any payments in and and pleading that under the default clause the whole amount became due in June and that the present application being made more than three years after that date was barred by time After this namely on th April the decree holders filed an application certifying the payments alleged to have been made The learned Subordinate Judge dismissed this last application from which the decree holders have attempted to file an execution appeal which is connected He also dismissed the application for execution holding that it was barred by time The main appeal has been preferred from this order The Bench before whom the case came up in the first instance has referred five questions to this Pull Bench I think that if we were satisfied that the practice which has prevailed in this <ORG> for the last years or so is contrary to the express provisions of the law we should have no hesitation in overruling the cases of this <ORG> which lay down that rule of practice The principle of stare decisis does not apply to such decisions as they cannot be considered to have affected any rights in property or title or to have affected contracts and other dealings And lastly the present <ORG> has been constituted by his Lordship the Chief Justice with the express purpose of reconsidering those cases presumably in view of the fact that a different view prevails in the other <ORG> The first question is Whether there is any period of limitation applicable to a decree holder certifying a payment under Order Rule Sub rule Civil It is obvious that there is no express article of the Limitation Act which is made applicable to the certification of payment by the decree holder similar to Article which applies to an application by the judgment debtor under Order Rule Sub rule All that the decree holder is to do is to declare that he has received payment He need make no application to the <ORG> and may not ask the <ORG> to do anything at all It therefore seems to me that the certification by the decree holder is not by way of application I have therefore no hesitation in answering the first question in the negative The logical result of holding that there is no bar of limitation under the Limitation Act is that no restriction as to any time limit can be imposed on the certification To say that a decree holder must certify payment before his decree becomes prima facie time barred is undoubtedly to impose a time limit In my opinion there is no justification for such a view On the language of the rule as it stands there is nothing which debars a decree holder from certifying payment after the ordinary three years for an application for execution have expired whether a statement of payment made by the decree holder in the execution application satisfies the requirements of Order Rule Sub rule Civil and permits him to prove that the payment was in fact made Rule lays down particulars which have to be mentioned in the application for execution If that is permissible there is no good ground for holding that the two cannot be contained in one and the same document but must be evidenced by two deeds filed one after the other The fourth question is Whether a decree holder may certify an alleged payment after he has made an application for execution so as to be able to prove that payment in the execution proceedings But cases may arise where the fact of payment was owing to a mistake or oversight or some other cause not mentioned in the application Nor is there any provision which prevents him from amending his application provided no question of limitation is involved Act namely the dates fixed for the payment of the instalments or the date of the default It does not say that in the case of default the decree holder shall have power or option to recover the amount but says that the amount shall be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs There is undoubtedly a sharp conflict of opinion on the question whether in the case of such instalment decrees the first default makes time begin to ran in respect of all subsequent instalments so as to compel the decree holder to apply for execution within three years of the first default on penalty of losing his rights or whether he has a recurring right on each of the successive defaults Opinions have been expressed both for and against the view that the principle of successive defaults embodied in Article should be applied in this case also Sometimes the decision has depended on whether it was compulsory for the decree holder to apply for execution on the happening of the first default or whether he had the option to ignore it and wait for the next default Throughout the judgment there is no mention of the article which was applicable but possibly the learned Judges were assuming that Article of the old Act corresponding to Article of the present Act was applicable but they have omitted to say so the proviso was If default was made in the payment of instalments the full amount should become due It is dangerous to assume that there is any general principle underlying the whole of the Limitation Act governing cases of default Each article has its own phraseology for fixing the time from which limitation begins to run and we have only to determine the date which on the language of the relevant article Is fixed Article uses the expression when the money becomes due Article Sub clause has the expression the certain date on which the decree directs payment There too the decree provided that the husband would pay Rs annually to the wife and remain in possession of the disputed property but in case of default of payment the property would be made over to the wife Then dealing with the wife right to recover the property on account of the default their Lordships held that upon the construction of the decree itself on the occasion of a default in each payment the right of the respondent to have the said property made over to her arose and therefore the claim was not time barred because it was made more than three years after the first default I venture to think that as Article was not in express terms applicable their Lordships had in mind the provisions of Article under which having regard to the construction of the decree the right to apply accrued each time that a default was made I fail to see how the decree holder application for recovery of the instalments after the dates fixed for their payment have expired can be taken out of Article The decree had expressly directed the payment of these instalments on specified dates th June and th June The learned advocate for the judgment debtor relies on the proviso which stated that if default in the payment of two instalments is made the whole amount shall be paid by the defendants and contends that the whole amount became payable on the th June by which time two consecutive defaults had taken place I think that in the previous cases of <ORG> referred to by me attention was not directed to the significance of this expression All the same the date fixed for payment must be a certain date In my opinion the word certain is used in contradistinction to uncertain The word certain in my opinion is a contrast of the word uncertain as that word is used for instance in Sections and Contract Act or Sections and Act In this view time did not begin to run under Article for the recovery of all the subsequent instalments from the date of the first default but under Clause a separate period of three years is prescribed to run from the respective date on which each instalment fell due In such circumstances the application for the recovery of the amounts of instalments which fell due more than three years prior to the application would unless it was saved by Sections or be barred by time but the application would still be within time as regards those instalments which fell due within three years in spite of a default clause As the dates fixed for all the instalments had expired before the application for execution was made there was no necessity for the decree holder to enforce the default clause The case where a decree holder applies to recover the whole amount by enforcement of the default clause before the dates fixed for the subsequent instalments have arrived would be quite different Whether there is any period of limitation applicable to a decree holder certifying a payment under Order Rule Sub rule Civil Whether a statement of payment made by the decree holder in the execution application satisfies the requirements of Order Rule Sub rule Civil and permits him to prove that the payment was in fact made Whether a decree holder may certify an alleged payment after he has made an application for execution so as to be able to prove that payment in the execution proceedings Act namely the dates fixed for the payment of the instalments or the date of the default On the first question whether there is any period of limitation applicable to the decree holder certifying a payment under Order Rule Sub rule Civil there can be but one answer namely that in the negative A certificate of payment given by the decree holder to the <ORG> is a mere intimation to it that he has received a certain sum of money from the judgment debtor or that the decree has been wholly or partially satisfied in a particular way His duty is finished as soon as he has given the intimation to the <ORG> If there is no rule of limitation the decree holder must be in a position to be able to certify payment even after the decree should appear on ignoring the payment certified as time barred The argument that if a statement contained in an application for execution was to be taken as good enough for the purpose of certification there would be no need for enacting Rule of Order has in my opinion no force This question has been framed in view of the fact that although the execution application in the case out of which this reference has arisen contained the payments alleged by the decree holder he filed a certificate after the judgment debtor raised the plea of limitation The object of that certificate was So remove any formal obstacle that might be in the way of the decree holder proving the alleged payments if the statement contained in the application itself be treated as an insufficient certificate This question was answered by me in the negative in <NAME> case A I All and I see no reason to alter the opinion then entertained by me While it can never be doubted that the decree holder can always tell the <ORG> that he has received a certain amount of money from the judgment debtor or that his decree has been otherwise partially satisfied by the judgment debtor with the result that the decree will not be executed to the extent it has been satisfied it should not be open to a decree holder when a controversy of limitation has been raised to come forward with a statement that on account of a certain payment or adjustment his application for execution should be treated as within time The question as framed assumes as a part of the terms of the decree that the decree holder has the option either to enforce payment of the entire decretal amount or not to do so in the case of the default in the payment of one or more instalments Act is the article which applies to execution of decrees Where the application is to enforce any payment which the decree or order directs to be made at certain date such date Where a decree or order directs that in case of a certain amount being not paid on a particular date the whole of the amount then payable shall at once be realizable it cannot be said that the whole of the amount so payable is a payment which the decree or order directs to be made at a certain date Although the non payment makes the whole balance at once realizable there is no direction in the decree or order as to the date when the whole of the balance is to be paid In the case of any ordinary decree directing payment of money although the whole of the amount is payable as soon as the decree is passed it cannot be said that the decree directs that the payment should be made on a particular date It overlooks the fact that the date th June is neither specified in the decree nor is it a date which is mentioned by necessary implication as having been fixed by the decree for payment My answer therefore to this question is that the clause which makes the balance of the decretal amount at once payable does not make the whole of the amount payable on the dates fixed in the decree for payment of particular items or on the dates following such dates As to the first I agree that there is no period of limitation applicable to a decree holder certifying a payment under Order Rule Sub rule Civil As to the third question I agree that a statement of payment made by the decree holder in the execution application satisfies the requirements of Order Rule Sub rule Civil and permits him to prove that the payment was in fact made and I would add that it is quite immaterial for this purpose in which column or in which part of the application the statement is made provided that it amounts to a clear statement of the receipt of payment As to the fourth question there is nothing to prevent a decree holder stating subsequently to his application for execution that he received a certain sum prior to the application If such a statement was made before controversy of any sort as to limitation arose either by a <ORG> officer reporting the application to be barred by limitation or by objection by the judgment debtor or otherwise such statement may be treated as in effect an amendment of the application for execution and in view of my answer to the third question amounts to a certificate But if such statement is made after controversy arose while there is no reason why the <ORG> should refuse to allow the statement to be filed for any other purpose than that of constituting a certificate to place on record evidence suggesting that the omission in the application for execution was a bona fide mistake it cannot have the force of a certificate Act namely the dates fixed for the payment of the instalments or the date of the default where are the such dates within the meaning of Article the dates fixed for the payment of the instalments or the date of the default But payment of the last two sums of Rs each was denied by the judgment debtor and we have to answer this question on the assumption that the instalments being payable on each th June the judgment debtor had on th June made default as to two successive instalments and a balance of Rupees remained That if he made default in respect of any two successive instalments the judgment debtor was to pay up the whole balance in the event of default in payment of two instalments the remaining decretal amount was made payable in a lump sum with interest at per cent per annum by the defendants that the remaining decretal amount is Rs It is of course true that it so happens that at the time of the application the dates for all the instalments payable had passed and so whether the application was for specified unpaid instalments already due or for the remaining decretal amounts the amount claimed in this case would be the same If the application be interpreted as an application under the first part of the decree for instalments due I can see no reason for holding that the fact that the judgment debtor had made two successive defaults and incurred the more severe penalty provided by the second part of the decree deprived the decree holder of the right to enforce the first part of the decree and executed it at any time in respect of any instalments or instalments his right to which was not barred by limitation on th June was not made there was undoubtedly a default in two successive payments a default which gave the decree holder a right to execute on th June for the whole balance Next before we consider whether the decree holder got by subsequent default any fresh starting point for limitation of his right to execute for the balance it must be determined what article of the Limitation Act applied to the right to execute for the balance which accrued to him on th June It could only be held to apply by holding the words certain date to mean a date certain i either apparent or determinable on the face of the decree or a date which on the happening of a particular event which might never have happened at all becomes certain The words the decree directs to be made at a certain date seem to me open only to the construction that the date must be specified in or with certainty ascertain able from the decree itself It of course follows that whether or not any two later successive default could be relied upon by waiving or ignoring a prior default or defaults the date of the second of such successive defaults would be equally not certain within the meaning of Article and the question of the right of the decree holder to waive or ignore a default does not here arise I would answer then that while Article would apply to an application to execute in respect of and for particular instalments due on dates certain from the decree itself it does not apply at all to the present application for execution which is under the second part of the decree But there is another consideration to which I have referred but which it was not in that connexion necessary to pursue when considering the applicability of Article to the second part of the decree There is nothing whatever in this phrase to limit it to the first two successive defaults and such a restriction would moreover be ordinarily to the prejudice of the judgment debtor by forcing the decree holder to take action Therefore in this case the decree holder could apply on th June by reason of the defaults on th June and th June for execution for the balance due i for the whole decretal amount less amounts paid and less individual instalments already barred by limitation I would therefore answer the fifth question as follows If the particular application for execution be interpreted as an application under the first part of the decree to recover certain instalments already overdue Article applies and limitation will run in respect of each instalment from the date on which it became payable If the particular application for execution be interpreted as application under the second part of the decree to recover the balance of the decretal amount remaining unpaid Art applies and limitation will run as to the whole balance unpaid from the date of the later of the last two successive instalments unpaid the decree holder being entitled to a decree for the whole balance if his application is within three years of that date less the amount of any individual instalments which regarded as individual instalments are not already barred by limitation Whether there is any period of limitation applicable to a decree holder certifying a payment under Order Rule Sub rule Civil A There is no such period If not must a decree holder certify payment before a decree will be time barred if the payment sought to be certified by the decree holder be ignored A No Whether a statement of payment made by the decree holder in the execution application satisfies the requirements of Order Rule Sub rule Civil and permits him to prove that the payment was in fact made A Yes Whether a decree holder may certify an alleged payment after he has made an application for execution so as to be able to prove that payment in the execution proceedings A If the statement purporting to certify the alleged payment though made after the application for execution has been made is made before any controversy arises either by a <ORG> officer reporting the application to be barred by limitation or by objection by the judgment debtor or otherwise such statement has the effect of a certificate But if such statement is made after controversy arose while there is no reason why the <ORG> should refuse to allow the statement to be filed for any other purpose than that of constituting a certificate to place on record evidence suggesting that the omission in the application for execution was a bona fide mistake it cannot have the force of a certificate as re drafted by the Full Bench Where a compromise decree a directs payment by instalments on named dates and further directs the judgment debtor to pay the entire balance due if he makes default as to any two successive instalments what are the such dates within the meaning of Article the date fixed for the payment of the instalments or the date of the default Mukerji If the application is one for the remaining unpaid balance of the decretal amount under the second part of the decree it is not governed by Article at all but by Article and limitation will run from the date of the last of any two successive defaults the decree holder being entitled to a decree for the whole balance due less the amount of any individual instalments which regarded as individual instalments are not already barred by limitation In cases of this description it is undesirable to interpret the application too strictly the Court may well pay regard to the substance of the application
