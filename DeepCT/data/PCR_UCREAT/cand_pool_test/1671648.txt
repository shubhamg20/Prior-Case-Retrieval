claim was disallowed by the <ORG> officer but on appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner accepted the claim and allowed the deduction on the view that the assessee did not acquire any capital asset when it purchased the loom hours and the amount spent by it was incurred for running the business of working it with a view to producing day to day profits and it was part of operating cost or revenue cost of production ITR held that the amount paid by the assessee for purchase of the loom hours was in the nature of capital expenditure and was therefore not deductible under section xv of the <ORG> Act An expenditure incurred by an assessee can qualify for deduction under section xv only if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of his business but even if it fulfills this requirement it is nob enough it must further be of revenue as distinguished from capital nature <NAME> case was a converse case where the question was whether an amount received by the assessee for sale of loom hours was the nature of capital receipt or revenue receipt and <ORG> took the view that it was in the nature of capital receipt and hence not taxable The decision in <NAME> case cannot on this account be regarded as an authority for the proposition that payment made by an assessee for purchase of loom hours would be capital expenditure because it is not a universally true proposition that what may be capital receipt in the hands of the payee must necessarily be capital expenditure in relation to the payer This question is res integra and therefore this decision cannot be regarded as an authority for the proposition that The amount paid for purchase of loom hours was capital and not revenue expenditure If there had been no working time agreement each mill would have been entitled to work its looms uninterruptedly for twenty four hours a day throughout the week but that would have resulted in production of jute very much in excess of the demand in the world market leading to unfair competition and precipitous fall in jute price and in the process prejudicially affecting all the mills and therefore with a view to protecting the interest of the mills who were members of the <ORG> the working time agreement was entered into restricting the number of working hours per week for which each mill could work its looms But a provision was made in clause of the working time agreement that the whole or a part of the working hours per week could be transferred by one mill to another for a period of not less than six months and if such transfer was approved and registered by the <ORG> of the <ORG> the transferee mill would be entitled to utilise the number of working hours per week transferred to it in addition to the working hours per week allowed to it under the working time agreement while the transferor mill could cease to be entitled to avail of the number of working hours per week so transferred and those would be liable to be deducted from the number of working hours per week otherwise allotted to it Every case has to be decided on its own facts keeping in mind the broad picture of the whole Operation in respect of which the expenditure has been incurred Even this test must yield were there are special circumstances leading to a contrary decision There may be cases where expenditure even if incurred for obtaining advantage of enduring benefit may none the less be on revenue account and the test one during benefit may break down the expenditure would be on revenue account even though tho advantage may endure for an indefinite future So long as tho expenditure in question can be clearly referred to the acquisition of an asset which falls within one or the other of these two categories such a test would be a critical one But this test also sometimes breaks down because there are many forms of expenditure which do not fall easily within these two categories and not infrequently the line of demarcation is difficult to draw and leads to subtle distinctions between profit that is made out of assets and profit that is made upon assets or with assets It is true that if disbursement is made for acquisition of a source of profit or income it would ordinarily be in the nature of capital expenditure But it cannot be said in the present case that the assesses acquired a source profit or income when it purchased loom hours The source of profit or income was the profit making apparatus and this remained untouched and unaltered There was no enlargement of the permanent structure of which the income would be the produce or fruit The expenditure incurred for this purpose was primarily and essentially related to the operation or working of the looms which constituted the profit earning apparatus of the assesses When dealing with cases where the question is whether expenditure incurred by an assesses is capital or revenue expenditure the question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency If the outgoing expenditure is so related to the carrying on or the conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an internal part of the profit earning process and not for acquisition of an asset or a right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of the carrying on of the business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure In the instant case a the payment made by the assesses for the purchase of loom hours was expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning <NAME> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave raises the vexed question whether a particular expenditure incurred by the assessee is of capital or revenue nature This question has always presented a difficult problem and continually baffled the courts because it has not been possible despite occasional judicial valour to formulate a test for distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure which will provide an infallible answer in all situations There have been numerous decisions where this question has been debated but it is not possible to reconcile the reasons given in all of them since each decision has turned upon some particular aspect which has been regarded as crucial and no general principle can be deduced from any decision and applied blindly to a different kind of case where the constellation of facts may be dissimilar and other factors may be present which may give a different hue to the case But first let us state the necessary facts It has a factory with a certain number of looms situate in West Bengal The <ORG> consists of various jute manufacturing mills as its members and it has been formed with a view to protecting the interests of the members We are concerned in this appeal with the fourth working time agreement and since the decision of the controversy before us turns upon the interpretation of its true nature and effect we shall refer to some of its relevant provisions There were four conditions precedent subject to which the allotment of hours of work transferred by one member to another could be utilised by the latter and those of them were as under No hours of work shall be transferred unless The transfer covers hours of work per week for a period of not less than six months ii All agreements to transfer shall as a condition precedent to any rights being obtained by transferees be submitted with an explanation to the <ORG> and the <ORG> decision The claim was disallowed by the Income tax officer but on appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner accepted the claim and allowed the deduction on the view that the assessee did not acquire any capital asset when it purchased the loom hours and the amount spent by it was incurred for running the business or working it with a view to producing day to day profits and it was part of operating cost or revenue cost of production The <ORG> preferred an appeal to the <ORG> but the appeal was unsuccessful and the <ORG> taking the same view as the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the expenditure incurred by the assessee was in the nature of revenue expenditure and hence deductible in computing the profits and gains of business of the assessee to decide in favour of the <ORG> and on that view it overturned the decision of the <ORG> and held that the amount paid by the assessee for purchase of the loom hours was in the nature of capital expenditure and was therefore not deductible under section xv of the Act The assessee thereupon preferred the present appeal by special leave obtained from this Court Now an expenditure incurred by an assessee can qualify for deduction under section xv only if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of his business but even if it fulfils this requirement it is not enough it must further be of revenue as distinguished from capital nature Here in the present case it was not contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the sum of Rs was not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the assessee business but the only argument was and this argument found favour with <ORG> that it represented capital expenditure and was hence not deductible under section xv The sole question which therefore arises for determination in the appeal is whether the sum of Rs We shall have to examine this question on principle but before we do so we must refer to the decision of this Court in <ORG> case supra since that is the decision which weighed heavily with <ORG> in fact compelled it to negative the claim of the assessed and held the expenditure to be on capital account The view taken by this Court was that it was in the It was contended on A behalf of the <ORG> relying on this decision that just as the amount realised for sale of loom hours was held to be capital receipt so also the amount paid for purchase of loom hours must be held to be of capital nature Therefore the decision in <NAME> Devi Jute Mills case supra cannot be regarded as an authority for the proposition that payment made by an assessee for purchase of loom hours would be capital expenditure But more importantly it may be pointed out that <NAME> case supra proceeded on the basis that loom hours were a capital asset and the case was decided on that basis It was common ground between the parties throughout the proceedings right from the stage of the Income tax officer upto <ORG> that the right to work the looms for the allotted hours of work was an asset capable of being transferred and this Court therefore did not allow counsel on behalf of the <ORG> to raise a contention that loom hours were in the nature of a privilege and were not an asset at all Since it was a commonly accepted basis that loom hours were an asset or the assessee the only argument which could be advanced on behalf of the <ORG> was that when the assessee transferred a part of its hours of work per week to another member the transaction did not amount to sale of an asset belonging to the assessee but it was merely the turning of an asset to account by permitting the transferee to use that asset and hence the amount received by the assessee was income from business This principle sup ported as it was by numerous decisions was accepted by the court as a valid principle but it was pointed out that it had no application in the case before the court because though loom hours were an asset they could not from their very nature be let out while retaining property in them and there could be no grant of temporary right to use them The court therefore concluded that this was really a case of sale of loom hours and not of exploitation of loom hours by permitting user while retaining ownership and in the circumstances the amount received by the assessee from sale of loom hours was liable to be regarded as capital receipt and not income No question was raised before the court as to whether loom hours were an asset at all nor was any argument advanced as to what was the true nature of the transaction It is quite possible that if the question had been examined fully on principle unhampered by any pre determined hypothesis the court might have come to a different conclusion This decision cannot therefore be regarded as an authority compelling us to take the view that the amount paid for purchase of loom hours was capital and not If there had been no working time agreement each mill would have been entitled to work its looms uninterruptedly for twenty four hours a day throughout the week but that would have resulted in production of jute very much in excess of the demand in the world market leading to unfair competition and precipitous fall in jute price and in the process prejudicially affecting all the mills and therefore with a view to protecting the interest of the mills who were members of the <ORG> the working time agreement was entered into restricting the number of working hours per week for which each mill could work its looms But a provision was made in clause of the working time agreement that the whole or a part of the working hours per week could be transferred by one mill to another for a period of not less than six months and if such transfer was approved and registered by <ORG> the transferee mill would be entitled to utilise the number of working hours per week transferred to it in addition to the working hours per week allowed to it under the working time agreement while the transfer of mill would cease to be entitled to avail of the number of working hours per week so transferred and these would be liable to be deduced from the number of working hours per week otherwise allotted to it Every case has to be decided on its own facts keeping in mind the broad picture of the whole operation in respect of which the expenditure has been incurred One celebrated test is that laid down by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> Atherton where the learned Law Lord stated When an expenditure is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade there is very good reason in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital This test as the parenthetical clause shows must yield where there are special circumstances leading to a contrary conclusion and as pointed out by Lord <NAME> in Commissioner of Taxes <ORG> it would be misleading to suppose that in all cases securing a benefit for the business would be prima facie capital expenditure so long as the benefit is not so transitory as to have no endurance at all If the advantage consists merely in facilitating the assessee trading operations or enabling the management and conduct of the assesse business to be carried on more efficiently or more profitably while leaving the fixed capital untouched the expenditure would be on revenue account even though the advantage may endure for an indefinite future But even if this test were applied in the present case it does not yield a conclusion in favour of the <ORG> There is no addition to or expansion of the profit making apparatus of the assessee This test was applied by Lord <NAME> in the leading case of <NAME> Moore where the learned law Lord draw the distinction between fixed capital and circulating capital in words which have almost acquired the status of a definition Now as long as the expenditure in question can be clearly referred to the acquisition of an asset which falls within one or the other of these two categories such a test would be a critical one But this test also sometimes breaks down because there are many forms of expenditure which do not fall easily within these two categories and not infrequently as pointed out by Lord <NAME> in Commissioner of Taxes <ORG> supra the line of demarcation is difficult to draw and leads to subtle distinctions between profit that is made out of assets and profit that is made upon assets or with assets An illustrative example would be of expenditure incurred in preserving or maintaining capital assets But even if we were to apply this test it would not be possible to characterise the amount paid for purchase of loom hours as capital expenditure because acquisition of additional loom hours does not add at all to the fixed capital of the assessee The <ORG> however contended that by purchase of loom hours the assessee acquired a right to produce more than what it otherwise would have been entitled to do and this right to produce additional quantity of goods constituted addition to or augmentation of its profit making structure The assessee acquired the right to produce a larger quantity of goods and to earn more income and this according to the <ORG> amounted to acquisition of a source of profit or income which though intangible was never the less a source or spinner of income and the amount spent on purchase of this source of profit or income therefore represented expenditure of capital nature But we fail to see how it can at all be said in the present case that the assessee acquired a source of profit or income when it purchased loom hours There was no enlargement of the permanent structure of which the income would be the produce or fruit The expenditure incurred for this purpose was primarily and essentially related to the operation or working of the looms which constituted the profit earning apparatus of the assessee Now it is obvious that by purchase of such quota right the assessee would be able to acquire more raw material and that would increase the profitability of his profit making apparatus but the amount paid for purchase of such quota right would indubitably be revenue expenditure since it is incurred for acquiring raw material and is part of the operating cost On the same analogy payment made for purchase of loom hours which would enable the assessee to operate the profit making structure for a longer number of hours than those permitted under the working time agreement would also be part of the cost of performing the income earning options I and hence revenue in character When dealing with cases of this kind where the question is whether expenditure incurred by an assessee is capital or revenue expenditure it is necessary to bear in mind what <ORG> said in <ORG> Federal Commissioner of Taxation What is an outgoing of capital and what is an outgoing on account of revenue depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the justice classification of the legal rights if any secured employed or exhausted in the process The question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency is so related to the carrying on or the conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an integral part of the profit earning process and not for acquisition of an asset or a right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of the carrying on of the business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure or on the other hand is it a capital outlay is it expenditure necessary for the acquisition of property or of rights of permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on its trade at all It is clear from the above discussion that the payment made by the assessee for purchase of loom hours was expenditure laid out There are always cases falling indisputably on one or the other side of the line and it is a familiar argument in tax courts that the case under review bears close analogy to a case falling on the right side of the line and must therefore be decided in the same manner The facts of this case were that three companies which were engaged in the business of copper mining formed a group and consequent on a steep fall in the price of copper in the world market this group decided voluntarily to cut its production by per cent which for the three companies together meant a cut of tons for the year in question It was agreed between the three companies that for the purpose of giving effect to this cut company should cease production for one year and that the assesses company and company should undertake between them the whole group programme for the year reduced by the overall cut of tons and should pay compensation to company for the abandonment of its production for the year <ORG> held that the compensation paid by the assessee to company in consideration of the latter agreeing to cease production for one year was in the nature of revenue expenditure and was allowable as a deduction in computing the taxable income of the assessee The payment compensation represented expenditure incurred by the assessee for enabling it to produce more goods despite the cut of per cent and it was plainly part of the cost of performing the income earning operation There certain expenditure was incurred by the assessee company for the purpose of obtaining a supplementary charter altering its constitution so that the management of the company could be placed on a sound commercial footing and restrictions on the borrowing powers of the assessee company could be removed It must follow on an analogical reasoning that expenditure incurred by the assessee in the present case for the purpose of removing a restriction on the number of working hours for which it could operate the looms with a view to increasing its profits would also be in the nature of revenue expenditure We accordingly allow the appeal and answer the question referred by the <ORG> in favour of the assesse and against the <ORG>
