The appellant met with an accident while travelling in an Ambassador car Registration No MEQ on at about A near village Sirur on Karwar Mangalore Road National Highway No within the State of Karnataka Initially the appellant made a claim for compensation amounting to Rs but on he claimed Rs as the compensation from the respondents and claim petition was amended The appellant used to appear in the various courts including <ORG> and <ORG> The claim made on behalf of the appellant was resisted by the respondents to the said petition on different grounds The owner of the lorry resisted his liability to pay any amount of compensation on the ground that although he was the owner of the said lorry but since it was insured with respondent No the insurance company was liable to pay compensation if any to the appellant <ORG> who were the owner of the car resisted the claim made on behalf of the appellant asserting that the driver of the said car was driving the car very cautiously and carefully and the accident took place entirely due to the negligence on the part of the driver of the motor lorry <ORG> on consideration of the materials on record and the evidence adduced on behalf of the parties passed on Award directing respondent Nos and to pay jointly and severally to the appellant compensation of Rs together with interest at the rate of per annum from the date of the application i till payment and costs of the said application within three months In the award a direction was given to Respondent No the insurer of the car to pay all the compensation along with interest and costs on behalf of respondent No Against the Award aforesaid two appeals were filed before <ORG> one on behalf of the appellant for enhancement of the compensation awarded by the <ORG> and the other on behalf of <ORG> respondent No and <ORG> respondent No questioning the validity and correctness of the award in question On the aforesaid finding the appeal filed on behalf of the appellant was dismissed whereas the appeal filed on behalf of Respondent Nos and was allowed by <ORG> in part Even in an action based on the tort the applicant has to show that the defendant was negligent i there was a failure on his part to take that degree of care which was reasonable in the circumstances of the case There has never been any doubt that those using the highways are under a duty to be careful and the legal position today is quite plain that any person using the road as a motorist will be liable if by his action he negligently causes physical injuries to anybody else The <ORG> as well as <ORG> has examined the evidence adduced on behalf of the parties and have recorded clear findings that at the relevant time the car and the lorry were being driven in a rash and negligent manner <ORG> after referring to the order of the <ORG> said that after going through the evidence of the witnesses and the circumstances placed it was of the opinion that the <ORG> was right in holding that there was composite negligence on the part of the drivers of both the vehicles and because of such negligence the appellant had sustained such serious inju ries Broadly speaking while fixing an amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which is capable of being calculated in terms of money whereas non pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations In order to appreciate two concepts pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant i medical attendance ii loss of earning of profit upto the date of trial iii other material loss So far non pecu niary damages are concerned they may include i damages for mental and physical shock pain suffering already suffered or likely to be suffered in future ii damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a va riety of matters i on account of injury the claimant may not be able to walk run or sit iii damages for the loss of expectation of life i on account of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened iv inconvenience hardship discomfort disappointment frustration and mental stress in life That is why it has been said by courts that whenever any amount is determined as the compensation payable for any injury suffered during an accident the object is to compensate such injury so far as money can compensate because it is impossible to equate the money with the human sufferings or personal deprivations In its very nature whenever a <ORG> or a <ORG> is required to fix the amount of compensation in cases of acci dent it involves some guess work some hypothetical consideration some amount of sympathy linked with the nature of the disability caused No is concerned <ORG> has allowed the whole claim of Rs and there is no dispute on that account No is concerned the appellant has claimed Rs for the present and Rs for the future the appellant has claimed Rs for the present and Rs for the future We feel that there was no occasion for <ORG> to be so mathematical on this question The amount of compensation for non pecuniary loss is not easy to determine but the award must reflect that different circumstances have been taken into consideration <ORG> should have clarified that the interest shall not be payable over the amount directed to be paid to the appellant in respect of future expenditures under different heads The appeals of the appellant are allowed to the extent indicated above As the Civil Appeal Nos of have been allowed in part and the amount of compensation awarded to the victim by <ORG> has been enhanced this Special Leave Petition has to be dismissed and it is accordingly dismissed
