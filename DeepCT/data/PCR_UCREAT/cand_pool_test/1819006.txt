Against this order the tenants preferred an appeal under the provisions of Section iv to the Deputy Commissioner who after commenting on the proceedings of the Deputy Collector in terms which should not find a place in the judgment of any Court dismissed the landlords application on the ground that in his opinion the questions at issue should be decided only after a fall and fair trial or by <ORG> in the village It therefore cannot be and has not been disputed before us that in omitting to deal with the appeal before him on the merits the Deputy Commissioner has failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in him by law But on behalf of the tenants opposite parties it has been contended that the <ORG>s of Deputy Commissioner when dealing with applications for the enhancement of rent under the provisions of Sections to of the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act are not <ORG>s subject to the appellate jurisdiction of this <ORG> within the meaning of Section of the Indian High <ORG>s Act that superintendence over Deputy Commissioners in the performance of their duties under the Act is by its express provisions vested in the Commissioner and <ORG> and that therefore this <ORG> has no jurisdiction or at least should not interfere From the very nature of the proceedings themselves and also from the provisions of the Act as contained for instance in Chapter XVI it is clear that proceedings on applications for enhancement of rent are judicial proceedings and in view of the express provisions of Section which allows in certain cases a second appeal to this Court it cannot in our opinion be contended that Deputy Commissioners in the performance of their judicial duties under the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act are not Courts subject to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court We make no order as to costs
