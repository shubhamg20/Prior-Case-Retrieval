Foreign projects of composite activities Activities falling partly under HHB Whether relief can be granted under each sections separately Letters dated and <ORG> power to grant approval to foreign contracts Purpose and scope of Guidelines for approval nature of Approval once granted Whether to continue for subsequent assessment years for the same agreement HEADNOTE Section of the Income Tax Act provides for a deduction in computing the total income in respect of royalty commission fees or any similar payment received by the assessee from the Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise in consideration for the use outside India of any patent invention model design secret formula or process or similar property right or information concerning industrial commercial or scientific knowledge experience or skill made available or provided or agreed to be made available or provided to such Government or enterprise by the assessee or in consideration of technical services rendered or agreed to be rendered outside India to such government or enterprise by the assessee under an agreement approved by the <ORG> in this behalf The <ORG> accorded its approval on However with respect to Karkh and Diwaniyah projects the approval was granted for the assessment year stating that for the subsequent period section HHB which came into force would be operative but as against this it claimed a deduction of Rs He however set aside the assessment and directed the <ORG> to reappraise assessee claim for exemption under section HHB holding that the assessee being under a bona fide belief all through that it was entitled to relief under section did not have a proper opportunity of putting forth its claim for relief under section HHB <ORG> answered the reference against the assessee holding that the execution of the work by the assessee fell under section HHB and not under section the receipts of the assessee from the contracts did not fall within the category of receipts for which deduction is provided in section that the <ORG> approval was a qualified one which fully authorised and empowered the officer to determine whether all the conditions of the section were fulfilled as well as the amount if any which could be deducted under section In the assessee appeal to this Court it was contended by the <ORG> that the receipts of the assessee under the contract were profits and gains of its business of execution of foreign projects under sub clauses i and ii of clause of HHB and did not qualify for deduction under section as the receipts did not fall under any of the categories either of royalty commission fees or any similar payment and the assessee either made any information available nor rendered any technical service to its foreign clients the contract for <ORG> was in the nature of a turnkey project as the client wanted the project to be executed by the consortium complete in all respects and handed over to it and the client was neither interested in the details of the information possessed or the services rendered by the contractor nor was the assessee as per consortium agreement concerned with any part of the contract other than the civil works the assessee neither rendered any technical service nor made such information available either to the consortium or to the foreign government but the information possessed by it and the services rendered in these respects by its engineers and other employees were utilised by the assessee itself the contract being an integral indivisible one it was not permissible to the assessee to dissect the consideration as attributable to its several ingredients and apportion a part of it as being payment for information made available or technical services rendered to the foreign government even assuming that the whole or atleast a part of the consideration payable to the assessee falls under section still as per sub section of section HHB the assessee would be eligible for deduction under section HHB only and even if the assessee case falls under section to will be entitled to relief not on the entire profits derived by it but only to that portion of the receipts as can be described as having the character enumerated in section On behalf of the assessee it was contended that since the insertion of section HHB has not resulted in the deletion of section the two sections should be read harmoniously and given effect to together restricting the operation of section HHB to contracts entered into on or after so as not to effect the contracts entered into before that date and approved by the <ORG> that even after the insertion of section HHB there is room for applicability of section in relation to a contract of composite activities and section HHB applies only to construction installation activity simpliciter and that once an approval under section is granted on whatever date it be the approval should ensure for the entire period of contract and connot be restricted to any particular assessment year or years On the question whether the assessee is entitled to a deduction under section or section HHB or partly under one or partly under the other or under neither of the provisions Dismissing the assessee appeal this Court HELD The assessee was entitled to the relief under section for assessment years earlier to and the approval granted by the <ORG> under that section was right and proper Eligibility of an item to tax or deduction can hardly be made to depend on the label given to it by the parties The word similar occurring in section connotes that the payment made to the assessee need not be in the nature of royalty commission or fees only it could be any payment of like nature made in consideration of the use or supply of such an asset knowledge or services in the same manner as royalty fees or consideration could be AB In column of the applications for approval under section the assessee stated that the payments under the contracts did not come under category a i but they did fall under categories a ii and enumerated therein The assessee is entitled to deduction under section on the terms of that section even for and subsequent years The language of sub section of section HHB which gives precedence to a claim under section HHB over one under any other provision itself necessarily postulates the possibility of the whole or part of the consideration payable to an assessee for the execution of a foreign project qualifying for deduction under any other provision as well Equally there can be cases falling under section which do not at all relate to a foreign project as defined under section HHB While granting the approval under Section the <ORG> has not only the jurisdiction but also the responsibility of examining the agreement submitted for approval from all angles relevant to the deduction provided for under section and it is not competent to the <ORG> to question the maintainability of the claim for deduction under section in respect of the aspects gone into and decided upon by the <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN This is an appeal preferred by <ORG> hereinafter called the assessee from the judgment of <ORG> in I to of reported in I answering against the assessee the following questions of law referred to it under section of the Income Tax Act the Act Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> is right in holding that the assessee company is not an industrial company as defined in the Finance Act The first two Income Tax References were made to <ORG> at the instance of the assessee which was dissatisfied with the decision of <ORG> on these qestions there were two references because the above qestions arouse out of two cross appeals before the Tribunal one by the assessee and the other by the <ORG> We therefore do not express any opinion on it and merely dismiss the appeal in so far as this question is concerned The questions arise out of the assessee assessment to income tax for the assessment year the calendar year being the relevant previous year Section of the Act under which the assessee claimed deductions provides for a deduction in computing the total income in respect of royalties etc Where the gross total income of an assessee being an Indian company includes any income by way of royalty commission fees or any similar payment received by the assessee from the Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise in consideration for the use outside India of any patent invention model design secret formula or process or similar property right or information concerning industrial commercial or scientific knowledge experience or skill made available or provided or agreed to be made available or provided to such Government or enterprise by the assessee or in consideration of technical services rendered or agreed to be rendered outside India to such Government or enterprise by the assesse under an agreement approved by the Board in this behalf and such income is received in convertible foreign exchange in India or having been received in convertible foreign exchange outside India or having been converted into convertible foreign exchange outside India is brought into India by or on behalf of the assessee in accordance with any law for the time being in force for regulating payments and dealings in foreign exchange there shall be allowed in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section a deduction of the whole of such income so received in or brought into India in computing the total income of the assessee This provision reads thus Section HHB Deduction in respect of profits and gains from projects outside India Where the gross total income of an assessee being an Indian company or a person other than a company who is resident in India includes any profits and gains derived from the business of a the execution of a foreign project undertaken by the assessee in pursuance of a contract entered into by him or the execution of any work undertaken by him an forming part of a foreign project undertaken by any other person in pursuance of a contract entered into by such other person with the Government of a foreign State or any statutory or other public authority or agency in a foreign State or a foreign enterprise there shall in accordance with and subject to the provision of this section be allowed in computing the total income of the assessee a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to twenty five per cent thereof Provided that the consideration for the execution of such project or as the case may be of such work is payable in convertible foreign exchange The deduction under this section shall be allowed only if the following conditions are fulfilled namely i the assessee maintains separate accounts in respect of the profits and gains derived from the business of the execution of the foreign project or as the case may be of the work forming part of the foreign project undertaken by him and where the assessee is a person other than an Indian company or a co operative society such amounts have been audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below sub section of section and the assessee furnishes along with his return or income the report of such audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant ii an amount equal to twenty five per cent of the profits and gains referred to in sub section is debited to the profit and loss account of the previous year in respect of which the deduction under this section is to be allowed and credited to a reserve account to be called the Foreign Project Reserve Account to be utilised by the assessee during a period of five years next following for the purposes of his business other than for distribution by way of dividends or profits iii an amount equal to twenty five per cent of the profits and gains referred to in sub section is brought by the assessee in convertible foreign exchange into India in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and any rules made thereunder within a period of six months from the end of the previous year referred to in clause ii or where the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner is satisfied for reasons to be recorded in writing that the assessee is for reasons beyond his control unable to do so within the said period of six months within such further period as the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner may allow in this behalf Provided that where the amount credited by the assessee to the Foreign Projects Reserve Account in pursuance of clause ii or the amount brought into India by the assessee in pursuance of clause iii or each of the said amounts is less than twenty five per cent of the profits and gains referred to in sub section the deduction under that sub section shall be limited to the amount so credited in pursuance of clause ii or the amount so brought into India in pursuance of clause iii whichever is less If at any time before the expiry of five years from the end of the previous year in which the deduction under sub section is allowed the assessee utilises the amount credited to the Foreign Projects Reserve Account for distribution by way of dividends or profits or for any other purpose which is not a purpose of the business of the assessee the deduction originally allowed under sub section shall be deemed to have been wrongly allowed and the Income tax Officer may notwithstanding anything contained in this Act recompute the total income of the assessee for the relevant previous year and make the necessary amendment and the provisions of section shall so far as may be apply thereto the period of four years specified in sub section of that section being reckoned from the end of the previous year in which the money was so utilised lm The three questions which are now for consideration before us raise the issue whether the assessee is entitled to a deduction under section or section HHB or partly under one and partly under the other or indeed under neither of the provisions but as against this it claimed a deduction of Rs We shall discuss this aspect later The <ORG> at the request of the assessee referred the four questions of law which we have set out earlier for the decision of <ORG> The Court also came to the conclusion that the execution of the work by the assessee in the present case fall under section HHB and not section In the result questions to were answered against the assessee and in favour of the <ORG> The assessee has therefore preferred these appeals We shall also therefore proceed to discuss the issues raised in the light of the terms and conditions of this contract and the approval given therefor Before doing so we would like to point out that for the assessment year with which we are concerned a discussion of the relative spheres of section HHB and section would be called for and the assessee may get full or partial relief under either or neither of the sections for the said assessment year but if in the process we come to the conclusion that the provisions of section can have no application to the contracts in question such conclusion is bound to have repercussion also on the deductions claimed by and allowed to the assessee under that section in the earlier years in respect of some of the contracts As the material is purchased locally in Iraq there is no possibility or making any profit on its consumption in execution of the works For the subsequent period your attention is invited to the provision of Sec The amount eligible for deduction will be determined by Income tax Officer at the time of assessment This amendment compelled the assessee to send a letter to the <ORG> on explaining that this new provision would not stand in the way of approval being accorded to its contracts under section For the subsequent period your attention is invited to the provision of section HHB which are operative appearing at the end of para of the <ORG> letter NO FTD dated the following words and figures may please be substituted assessment years and onwards It appears that though the above intimation to the assessee was cryptic the <ORG> had decided to extend the period of operativeness of its approval under section only after consulting the Attorney General of India A The <ORG> had circulated the opinion of the A in this case along with the statement of case put up to him for opinion to all the officers of the <ORG> Suffice it to say that the writer of the letter was of opinion that the <ORG> should not have reviewed the decision taken by it on He stated that on the strength of the <ORG> letter dated the assessee was claiming exemption and requested that clear instructions should be issued early on the complications pointed out in the letter Thereupon a letter It observed It is that in respect of Karkh and Diwaniyah Projects confusion which has arisen in this case could have been avoided When he sought a clarification the <ORG> stated that inspite of approval under section if the income does not satisfy the requirements of that section the assessee would not be entitled to such deduction There is no doubt that the first qualifies approval followed by the modification of that approval coupled with this thinking on the part of the <ORG> as given to the Commissioner does indicate that the position was not clear in the mind of the authorities who approved or modified the approval of the contracts One aspect which may need consideration by us is the question how for the issue of the letter of affects the assessee claim for exemption under section in the present case There does not seem to be much doubt that the provisions of HHB apply to the contracts in the present case and that at the worst the assessee claim for exemption under section HHB deserves to be considered afresh after giving the assessee an opportunity of being hard as directed by the <ORG> Appeals and confirmed by <ORG> and <ORG> see ITR It is possible that with section HHB and as they stand today it might not make very much difference to the assessee whether the relief is granted under the one section or the other as they both permit a deduction from the gross total income of fifty per cent of the profits in the one case and of the qualifying receipts in the other This has made it very material to decide whether the assessee is entitled to the deduction under section and the question that really arises for our consideration is whether the relief under that section is available to the assessee It is sufficient to point out that the language of sub section of section HHB which gives precedence to a claim under section HHB over one under any other provision itself necessarily postulates the possibility of the whole or part of the consideration payable to an assessee for the execution of a foreign project qualifying for deduction under section HHB falling for consideration also under any other provision as well Sections to JJA QQ RR and permit a deduction in respect of the profits and gains or profits derived from various types of business undertakings or professions sections to and deal with income by way of dividends and interest falling under certain categories section which grants a deduction to cooperative societies classifies the deductible income into profits and gains from activities in the nature of business on the one hand and income falling under other heads such as interest dividends income from house property etc Not only this the section also requires that the assessee must have derived the receipts falling under the above categories in one of two ways i in consideration for the use outside India of any patent invention model design secret formula or process or similar property right or information concerning industrial commercial or scientific knowledge experience or skill made available or provided or agreed to be made available or provided to such Government or enterprise by the assessee or ii in consideration of technical services rendered or agreed to be rendered outside India to such Government or enterprise by the assessee While the details of the direct contract expenses set out in Schedule I include an item of royalties paid and the details of other expenditure set out in Schedule include an item of payment of technical consultation fees there is no similar item under contract receipts or other receipts The assessee balance sheet is thus one of a company carrying on business as Engineers and Contractors and reflects only the profits derived from such business This question does not concern us but in the course of the discussion the Court made the following observations on which <NAME> seeks to rely Section sub section opens with the words where the gross total income of an assessee includes any income by way of dividends from a domestic company and proceeds to say that in such a case there shall be allowed in computing the total income of the assessee a deduction from such income by way of dividends of an amount equal to the whole of such income or per cent of such income as the case may be depending on the nature of the domestic company from which the income by way of dividends is received Now the words such income by way of dividends must be referable to the income by way of dividends from a domestic company which is included in the gross total income Now if the words where the gross total income of an assessee includes any income by way of dividends from a domestic company in the opening part of the section refer only to the inclusion of the category of the income denoted by the words income by way of dividends from a domestic company and not to the quantum of the income so included the words such income cannot have reference to the quantum of the income included that is income by way of dividends from a domestic company The words such income as a matter of plain grammar must be substituted by the words income by way of dividends from a domestic company in order to arrive at a proper construction of the section and if that is done it would be obvious that the deduction is to be in respect of the whole or per cent of the income by way of dividends from a domestic company which can only mean the full amount of dividends received from a domestic company But we are unable to agree with him that there is an antithesis between the categories of income so specified and the expression profits and gains It is no doubt true that wherever the statute refers to the profits and gains of a business it has in mind the income chargeable under the Act under that head head specified in section of the Act but the other categories of income referred to in the various sections are not correlated to the headwise classification of section The mere fact therefore that the assessee is carrying on business as engineers and contractors and the receipts in question flow to it in the course of its business as such will not necessarily preclude relief under section if they can be brought within the categories of receipts mentioned in the section The expressions royalty and technical fees have been defined in section The word similar connotes that the payment made to the assessee need not be in the nature of royalty commission or fees only it could be any payment of like nature i made in consideration of the use or supply of such an asset knowledge or services in the same manner as royalty fees or consideration could be <NAME> then draws attention to the finding of the <ORG> in para of its order Admittedly in the present case there is no claim under the first part of the section and the claim was that the assessee company was receiving payments in consideration of technical services rendered outside India He submits that this is a finding of fact based on an admission which has not been specifically challenged by the assessee in its application for reference to <ORG> and that it is not open to the assessee to go behind this position at this stage which refers to consideration for technical services rendered outside India to the foreign Government or enterprise Sri <NAME> may not therefore be quite correct in asserting that the assessee had restricted its claim before the <ORG> only to the ground of technical services rendered by the assessee outside India to its client There is no basis to put forward a contention that though in the application to the <ORG> the assessee had claimed relief on two grounds it had given up a part of the claim before the <ORG> He submits that the assessee has neither made any information available to the foreign client nor has it rendered any technical services to the said client It is not necessary to quarrel with Sri <NAME> description of the contract as a turn key project which indeed was the description given to it by the assessee itself in para of the application to the <ORG> and in para of the letter dated or his consequent suggestion that the foreign government was not interested in There is equally no doubt that in executing the contract the assessee has rendered technical services Here again Sri <NAME> says no technical services were rendered by the assessee to the foreign Government the assessee only made use of the technical knowledge experience and skill of its own employees to perform a task undertaken by it In our view there is force in the assessee contention that it would not be possible to execute the contract without imparting to the foreign state and enterprise information of the category specified in the section Form of agreement also makes it clear that the consideration of the payment to be made by the employer to the contractor was for executing completing and maintaining works in conformity in all respect with the provisions of the contract The argument seems to be that the services in the present case will not be covered by the section because there was no privity of contract between the employees of the assessee who contributed their technical skill and the foreign Government Act and that too which is proposing to substitute the word technical or professional services in place of the word technical services now used in the section For the reasons discussed above we have come to the conclusion that under the contracts in question the assessee had made available technical information to the foreign Government for use outside India and had also rendered technical services to the foreign Government outside India He says that the contract has been found to be an integral indivisible contract and that it is not permissible for the assessee to dissect the consideration as attributable to its several ingredients and apportion a part of the consideration as being payment for information made available to or technical services rendered to the foreign <ORG> Though the lumpsum price is indicated for different works but the overall consideration is for the work as a whole and it is made clear even before the tenders were given that the contract could not be bifurcated and it could not be given in parts We have already considered the various case laws including certain decisions <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and <ORG> supra which throw light on interpretation on such contracts So far as the first proposition is concerned it is sufficient for us to point out that it is a well settled principle that exigibility of an item to tax or tax deduction can hardly be made to depend on the label given to it by the parties The cases referred to by the <ORG> and Sri <NAME> as to the indivisibility of a contract arose in an entirely different context This he says can be done by restricting the operation of section HHB to contracts entered into on or after on which date that section came into force and so as not to affect contracts entered into before that date and approved by the <ORG> Secondly he contends that the definition of foreign project in section HHB is a restrictive one it covers only the construction of the nature specified in sub clause i or the assembly and installation of the nature specified in sub clause ii there being no other prescribed work in terms of sub clause iii and it is only the consideration received for the carrying out of these two activities that is excluded from the purview of relief under other sections under Heading of Ch VI A Thirdly it is submitted that if the <ORG> after considering the arguments as to applicability of section HHB put forward by the assessee accepted this as a plausible view of the relative area of operation of the two provisions and extended the approval to assessment year onward as well it could not be said to have exceeded its jurisdiction and it is not open to the <ORG> to ignore the order of approval merely for the reason that section HHB has been introduced into the statute book The connection of Sri <NAME> that even after the insertion of section HHB there is room for applicabilty of section in relation to a contract of this type which is not a construction installation contract simpliciter appears attractive but we do not think section HHB should be interpreted in such a narrow or pedantic fashion The section provides for an exemption in respect of profits from a foreign project undertaken outside India in the course of business It is perhaps possible to say in such cases that there are two contracts in respect of a foreign project one of which will fall under section HHB and another under section Or it may be that even though there is a single contract it separately identifies the two sets of activities and provides separate consideration for each This is particularly so in the context of the fact that in the particular case as has been pointed out earlier the impartation of information was only indirect consisting of what the foreign enterprise of Government could gather from the manner of execution of the contract by the assessee and the technical services rendered to the non resident principal consisted only of the execution of the project for it by the assessee There is one single integral indivisible contract for executing a foreign project and the entire consideration is attributable to such execution On the other hand it seems to be clearly intended to ensure while granting approval under section in pursuance of the application that section HHB is given effect to and no part of the payment derived from the execution of such a project is allowed to qualify under section <NAME> sought to make a further point that even if the assessee case falls under section assessee will be entitled to relief not on the entire profits derived by the assessee but only to that portion of the receipts as can be ascribed the character in section There is of course a fallacy in this argument Thus if only of the receipts are attributable to section the assessee would be entitled to relief of of the under section HHB and the whole of the under section in other words a relief of which is more than of the whole This being so there is a complete identity of the matters governed by section HHB and section and so the assessee will be entitled to only and not both the reliefs We shall also proceed on the footing that the assessee is also right in saying that the <ORG> had after considering its representations accepted the position that the approval under section would ensure also for the assessment year onwards Section only empowers the <ORG> to approve of a contract on being satisfied that it gives rise to receipts qualifying for deduction under section and nothing more It has nothing more to do We have therefore come to the conclusion that the amendment of the <ORG> approval cannot help the assessee to overcome the mandate of section HHB While the <ORG> has every right to declare that section applies in respect of the receipts under a contract approved by it it has no statutory or other right to supersede or limit the clear terms of section HHB There was a good deal of discussion before us as to the scope and effect of the approval granted by the <ORG> to the terms of a contract under section Sri <NAME> says therefore the application for approval was based on wild estimates made before the contract began to be worked in right earnest and the <ORG> could certainly have had no possible material for accepting the basis of claim for exemption set out in col In the circumstances Sri <NAME> contends that the <ORG> should not be allowed to take up the stand that the approval of the <ORG> had no value at all and could be completely ignored by the assessing officer because In his opinion it did not fulfill the requirements of section we have considered the contentions urged on behalf of both parties Since we have already expressed our conclusion that the contract in the present case does come within the fold of section and that the <ORG> acted rightly in granting approval to the contract it may not be quite necessary for us to express any opinion on this issue But there is a change in the content and purpose of the approval Here again there is good reason over and above the general need to have a surveillance over foreign contracts why the power to grant approval is vested in a higher authority in the Income tax hierarchy itself envisaged in the section but that in cases where such apportionment was considered permissible it would grant approval to the agreement and have the quantification of the exemption to be decided by the assessing officer It said ix In the case of a composite agreement specifying a consolidated amount as consideration for purposes which include matters outside the scope of section use of trade marks supply of equipment etc It had also taken the view that a consideration for the use of the assessee trade mark would be outside the purview of section iii It was also stated in para ix of the circular dated that in the case of a composite agreement which specified a consolidated amount as consideration for purposes which included matters outside the scope of section the <ORG> may not approve such an agreement for the purposes of section of the Act if it was not possible to properly ascertain and determine the amount of the consideration relatable to the provision of the know how or technical services etc We have in view of the above discussion no doubt at all that while granting the approval under section the <ORG> has not only the jurisdiction but also the responsibility of examining the agreement submitted for approval from all angles relevant to the deduction provided for under section and that it is not competent to the <ORG> to question the maintainability of the claim for deduction under section of the aspects gone into and decided upon by the <ORG> Neither the introduction of the words in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this sections nor the various conditions outlined in the letter of approval add anything to or detract anything from the scope of the approval As already mentioned Sri <NAME> also contended that even after the insertion of HHB the assessee would be entitled to claim the deduction under section in view of the <ORG> amendment to the letter of approval that the approval will be operative for assessment year onwards rescinding the qualification in the earlier letter that the provisions of HHB will apply for assessment year onwards But we are unable to give effect to the <ORG> decision of in the same way as we have given effect to the <ORG> earlier approval letter of for a number of reasons The argument that the applicability of section HHB should be excluded from contracts entered into or those approved of under section before is patently untenable Section comes into force on and should be applicable for assessment year onwards in all cases <NAME> submitted that we should not favour the above interpretation as it would lead to an anomalous result He says that the whole idea of section HHB was to enlarge the benefits to contractors working abroad and earning foreign exchange but that by reason of our decision the assessee will now get relief only to the extent of in respect of a contract for which it got benefit in earlier years On the other hand the department would no doubt say that our conclusion that the assessee was entitled in earlier assessment year to relief on this type of contract is anomalous in the light of the fact that subsequently the legislature specifically provided that only of the earnings on foreign projects should be exempted In our view there is no force in these contentions Equally there can be cases falling under section which do not all relate to a foreign project as defined in section HHB There is therefore no anomaly or absurdity in the conclusion we have reached For the reasons discussed above we hold that the assessee was entitled to the relief under section for assessment years earlier to and that the approval granted by the <ORG> under that section was right and proper We however make no order as to costs
