Therefore whenever there is a breach of restrictions imposed by the statute by the <ORG> or the <ORG> the matter is justiciable and the aggrieved party is entitled to suitable relief at the hands of the court The undisputed facts of the case are That the respondent was appointed a Sub Inspector of Police by the Inspector General of Police Bihar and Orissa in January In the year departmental proceedings were taken against him and he was found guilty of cowardice and of not preparing search lists and was punished by demotion for ten years By an order dated the rd July which was communicated to the respondent on the th of July the Deputy Inspector General of Police having found him guilty of cowardice made an order dismissing him from service Aggrieved by the departmental action taken against him the respondent filed the suit out of which this appeal arises in the court of additional subordinate judge against the <ORG> of Bihar for a declaration that the order of the Deputy Inspector General of Police dismissing him from service was illegal and void and that he should be regarded as continuing in office As regards the arrears of salary it was held that the claim to it could only be made according to the procedure prescribed under rule of section of Chapter IV of Bihar and Orissa Service Code It was held that rule of the Bihar and Orissa Service Code had no application because the respondent had never been dismissed within the meaning of that rule The principal questions involved in this appeal are Whether <ORG> correctly held that rule above mentioned had no application to the case Whether a suit or arrears of salary by a civil servant is competent in a civil court Rule of the Bihar and Orissa Service Code provides Rule When the suspension of a Government servant as a penalty for misconduct is upon reconsideration or appeal held to have been unjustiliable or not wholly justifiable or when a Government servant who has been dismissed or removed or suspended pending enquiry into alleged misconduct is reinstated the revising or appellate authority may grant to him for the period of his absence from duty a if he is honourably acquitted the full pay to which he would have been entitled if he had not been dismissed removed or suspended and by an order to be separately recorded any allowance of which he was in receipt prior to his dismissal removal or suspension or if otherwise such proportion of such pay and allowances as the revising or appellate authority may direct Obviously these provisions have no application to the situation that arose in the present case provisions of section of the <ORG> of India Act which provides that no person shall be dismissed from the service of His Majesty by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed In these circumstances the enabling provisions of rule had no application whatsoever to the case of the plaintiff For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that <ORG> was right in holding that rule had no application to the facts and circumstances of this case and that the enabling provisions of this rule did not operate as a bar to the plaintiff action We think that the matter is covered by the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case with which we find ourselves in respectful agreement It was there held that the prerogative right of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at will having been given statutory form in sub section of section of the Government of India Act it could only be exercised subject to the limitations imposed by the remaining sub sections of that section and that it must follow as a necessary consequence that if any of those limitations was contravened the public servant concerned had a right to maintain an action against the <ORG> for appropriate relief and that there was no warrant for the proposition that that relief must be limited to a declaration and should not go beyond it It was further held that even if apart from the prerogative of the <ORG> to terminate the service of any of its servant at will the further prerogative could be invoked that no servant of the <ORG> could maintain an action against the <ORG> to recover arrears of pay even after the pay had been earned and had become due and that the prerogatives of the <ORG> had been preserved in the case of India by section of the Constitution Act it must be presumed that this further prerogative had been abandoned in the case of India by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and that it was not possible to subscribe to the proposition that while a creditor of a servant of the <ORG> was entitled as of right to compel the <ORG> to pay to him a substantial portion of the salary of such servant in satisfaction of a decree obtained against him the servant himself had no such right The provisions of section of the Civil Procedure Code give a right to the creditor to attach the salary of a servant of the <ORG> There were similar provisions in the Civil Procedure Code of also It seems to me therefore that <ORG> has not accepted the principle that the <ORG> is not liable to pay its servant salary The learned Solicitor General contended that the decision in <NAME> case was no longer good law and should be deemed to have been dissented from and overruled by the decision of their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> case and that in any event the view expressed in that decision should be preferred to the view expressed in <NAME> case In that case no claim had been made by the plaintiff for arrears of his pay The case was remitted to <ORG> with a direction to take such action as it thought necessary in regard to any application by the plaintiff for leave to amend the claim for recovery of damages He however urged that he was entitled to recover in the suit his arrears of pay from the date of the purported order of dismissal up to the date of action though this was not one of the reliefs claimed by him in the suit at all Their Lordships approved of the judgment of Lord <NAME> in the Scottish case of <NAME> The Admiralty in which that learned Judge laid down the rule in the following terms after reviewing various authorities These authorities deal only with the power of the <ORG> to dismiss a public servant but they appear to me to establish conclusively certain important points It is enough that the servant is a public servant and that public policy no matter on what ground it is based demands the qualification If these conclusions are justified by the authorities to which I have referred then it would seem to follow that the rule based on public policy which has been enforced against military servants of the <ORG> and which prevents such servants suing the <ORG> for their pay on the assumption that their only claim is on the bounty of the <ORG> and not for a contractual debt must equally apply to every public servant The observations made in <NAME> The <ORG> which is a Scottish case could not have been made if in the law of that country there were provisions similar to the provisions made in various sections of the Code of Civil Procedure referred to by <ORG> in <NAME> case There the question for consideration was whether the sterling overseas pay of an Indian civil servant was a debt owing and accruing within the meaning of rule of Order XLV of the Rules of <ORG> and which could be attached in satisfaction of an order for the payment of alimony It appears that the attention of the learned Judge was not invited to the provisions of section and other relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the learned Judge applied the dictum of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> The <ORG> to the case of a civil servant from India We are therefore of the opinion that the rule laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> case without a consideration of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relevant to the inquiry and without a consideration of the reasoning of <ORG> in <NAME> case cannot be treated particularly because the matter was not directly involved in the suit as the final word on the subject We are in no way bound by the decision given either in <NAME> case or by the decision given by <ORG> in <NAME> case But on a consideration of the reasons given in the two judgments we think that the rule of English law that a civil servant cannot maintain a suit against the State or against the <ORG> for the recovery of arrears of salary does not prevail in this country and that it has been negatived by the provisions of the statute law in India Reliance was also placed by the learned Solicitor General on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> North West Frontier Province Failing to get relief by departmental proceedings he instituted a suit in <ORG> Peshawar That court accordingly set aside the decree of the Judicial Commissioner and remitted the case with a declaration that there shall be substituted for the decree appealed against a declaration in the terms above stated with such further directions as the circumstances of the case may require in the light of the observations of their judgment It was held by the <ORG> in the first instance allowing the appeal of the North West Frontier Province and reversing the decision of <ORG> of India that the North West Frontier Province Police Rules had become operative in at some date before April when the respondent was dismissed and that rule was a valid rule made under the authority conferred on the I A During the arguments before the Privy <ORG> reference was made to section of the Code of Civil Procedure and to the decision of the <ORG> Court in <NAME> case and it was also noticed that following on the remit of the case to the Judicial Commissioner by the order of <ORG> dated December the respondent had obtained a decree for payment of Rs By their Lordships direction a copy of this letter was sent to the respondent which was awarded to him or that he has any claim to a further sum in respect of arrears of pay It is thus clear that in express terms in this decision their Lordships declined to give any opinion on the question whether the respondent was entitled as of right to recover arrears of pay awarded to him by the Judicial Commissioner in spite of the circumstance that their attention had been drawn to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case It was further suggested that some meaning must be given to the words holds office during His Majesty pleasure as these words cannot be ignored and that they bear the meaning given to them by <ORG> in <NAME> case It has again no relation or connection with the question whether an action can be filed to recover arrears of salary against the <ORG> The rule that a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of the <ORG> has its origin in the latin phrase durante bene placito during pleasure meaning that the tenure of office of a civil servant except where it is otherwise provided by statute can be terminated at any time without cause assigned In other words civil servants are liable to dismissal without notice and there is no right of action for wrongful dismissal that is that they cannot claim damages for premature termination of their services It follows therefore that whenever there is a breach of restrictions imposed by the statute by the <ORG> or the <ORG> the matter is justiciable and the party aggrieved is entitled to suitable relief at the hands of the court As pointed out earlier in this judgment there is no warrant for the proposition that the relief must be limited to the declaration and cannot go beyond it To the extent that the rule that <ORG> servants hold office during pleasure has been departed from by the statute the <ORG> servants are entitled to relief like any other person under the ordinary law and that relief therefore must be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure Section of the <ORG> of India Act provides that the law in force in British India immediately before the commencement of the Act shall continue in force until altered repealed or amended by a competent legislature It is clear therefore that the Indian Legislatures were conferred by the <ORG> of India Act power to regulate the procedure in regard to actions against the Grown and to make provision for reliefs that could be granted in such actions These provisions of the <ORG> of India Act stand by themselves independently of what is contained in section and therefore no question arises that section of the Code of Civil Procedure which has the sanction of the <ORG> of India Act itself is in status lower than the rule laid down in section Section of the Judiciary Act relating to the Commonwealth of Australia provides Any person making any claim against the Commonwealth whether in contract or in tort may respect of the claim bring a suit against the Times News May Section of the <ORG> of India Act conferred the right of suit against the <ORG> Sub section of that section ran as follows Every person shall have the same remedies against the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> as he might have had against <ORG> if the Government of India Act and this Act had not been passed Be that as it may that rule has no application to the case of arrears of salary earned by a public servant for the period that he was actually in office The Code of Civil Procedure from right up to has prescribed the procedure for all kinds of suits and section and the provision of Order XXI substantially stand the same as they were in and those provisions have received recognition in all the Government of India Acts that have been passed since the year For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that this appeal is without force and we accordingly dismiss it with costs
