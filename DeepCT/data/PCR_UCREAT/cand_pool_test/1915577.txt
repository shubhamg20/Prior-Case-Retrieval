Held that of <ORG> Rules which allows Letters Patent appeals to be filed within days from the date of the judgment of the single judge is a special law within the meaning of of the Limitation Act and such appeals may be filed within the said period of days and not days as prescribed by Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is preferred against the judgment of a division bench of <ORG> of <ORG> at Delhi confirming that of a single Judge of <ORG> issuing a writ of mandamus against <ORG> directing it to restore possession of the flat requisitioned by the said <ORG> to the respondents It appears that four or five months in the flat was vacant and thereafter it was occupied by refugees from West Pakistan It was afterwards given to the present respondent No <NAME> As no reply was given to that request the said respondent sent a reminder on June and to that he received a reply to the effect that the matter is receiving attention and further communication will follow in due course The appeal was filed within days from the date of the said order after excluding the time taken for obtaining certified copies of the necessary documents but more than days thereafter <ORG> consisting of the Chief Justice and <NAME> The learned Judges held that the appeal was filed out of time and that there was not sufficient reason for excusing the delay Learned Attorney General appearing for the appellants contends that the Letters Patent appeal it having been filed within days from the date of the judgment of Falshaw was within time and that in any view having regard to the fluid state of the law on the question whether the and prescribed by the Limitation Act or the rule by <ORG> would govern that appeal there Was sufficient cause for excusing the delay of the Requisitioned Land Continuance of Powers Act Act No of hereinafter called the Act whereunder the appropriate Government was given the power to use or deal with a requisitioned land in such manner as may appear to it to be expedient that in exercise of the said power the said Government put <NAME> in possession of the same and that under of the Requisitioning and Acquisitioning of Immovable Property Act hereinafter called the Act the said requisition shall be deemed to be property requisitioned under of the said Act and that under the said section the said purpose must be deemed to be a public purpose being the purpose of the <ORG> and as that purpose did not cease to exist the respondents are not entitled to ask for de requisition of the said flat Three questions fall to be considered in this appear namely what is the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal against an order of a Single Judge of <ORG> to a division bench of the same <ORG> if the appeal was preferred out of time was there a sufficient cause for excusing the delay in preferring the appeal are the respondents now legally entitled to ask <ORG> to de requisition the said premises under the Act To appreciate the first contention it is necessary to read the relevant provisions of the Limitation Act the clauses of the Letters Patent and the rules made by <ORG> Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First Schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that Schedule The First Schedule Description of appeal Period of Time from of which limitation period begains to run And WE do further ordain that it shall be lawful for <ORG> at Lahore from time to time to make rules and orders for regulating the practice of the <ORG> and for the purpose of adopting as far as possible the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure being an Act No of passed by the Governor General in <ORG> and the provisions of any law which has been or may be made amending or altering the same by competent legislative authority for India to all proceedings in its testamentary intestate and matrimonial jurisdiction respectively of the Limitation Act a period of days is prescribed for preferring an appeal from an order of <ORG> in the exercise of its Original Jurisdiction under of High <ORG> Rules for an appeal under cl of the <ORG> a period of limitation of days is provided The combined effect of the provisions may be stated thus Under cl of the <ORG> the High <ORG> of Judicature of Lahore has the power to make a rule prescribing the period of limitation in respect of appeals from orders made by that <ORG> in exercise of its Original Jurisdiction to a division bench of that High <ORG> thereof the provisions of the <ORG> are subject to the legislative powers of the Governor General in <ORG> and therefore any rule made in exercise of a power conferred under the <ORG> must necessarily be subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act which is a law made by the <ORG> Article of the Limitation Act prescribes the period of limitation of days for preferring an appeal against an order made by the High <ORG> in exercise of its original jurisdiction and if there is no other limitation on that section of the High <ORG> Rules must give way to the said Article But of the Limitation Act limits the scope of that section for it says that where a special or local law prescribes for an appeal a period prescribed therefore in the said Schedule the provisions of shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that Schedule that is if there is a special or local law prescribing a period of limition it will be deemed to be the period of limitation prescribed by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act in respect of an appeal covered by that rule of the <ORG> the High <ORG> has power to make a rule prescribing the period of limitation for a <ORG> appeal against an order of a single Judge made in exercise of the original jurisdiction of the High <ORG> and by reason of cl thereof the said rule is subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act but the Limitation Act itself saves the operation of the said rule of the Limitation Act will govern appeals not covered by or appeals from orders made by other High <ORG>s in exercise of their original jurisdiction if no rule similar to is made by the said High <ORG> or High <ORG>s Rule is made by the High <ORG> in exercise of the legislative power conferred upon the said High <ORG> under cl of the <ORG> As the said rule is a law made in respect of special cases covered by it it would certainly be a special law within the meaning of of the Limitation Act We agree with this view If so it follows that under an appeal could be filed within days from the date of the order of Falshaw and the appeal having been filed on the twenty third day it was well within time any property under sub rule that Government may use or deal with the property in such manner as may appear to it to be expedient and may acquire it by serving on the owner thereof or here the owner is not readily traceable or the ownership is in dispute by publishing in the official <ORG> a notice stating that <ORG> as the case may be has decided to acquire it in pursuance of this rule Under A of the said Rules the power to requisition a property was conditioned by the purposes for which it could be so requisitioned though it was left to the subjective satisfaction of the <ORG> to decide whether it was necessary or expedient to do so The wide import of the word expedient in Sub must necessarily be limited to the purposes under sub as otherwise we would be attributing to the <ORG> an intention to confer a power on the <ORG> to requisition a property on false pretenses Relying upon the deeming clause it is contended that the requisition of the land and the user of the same by the <ORG> under the Act should be deemed to be a requisition made under of the Act for a public purpose being the purpose of the <ORG> and as that purpose namely user by <ORG> had not ceased the appellants were not bound to de requisition under of the Act It is said that under the Rules a requisition need not have been made for a public purpose but the express provisions of A of the Rules negative this Contention In the present case on the facts it is manifest that the flat was not used for any of the purposes for which it was requisitioned for a number of years and indeed when the Act came into force it was used only for locating <ORG> which is clearly not one of the purposes for which the flat was requisitioned If so it must be held that the purpose for which the property was requisitioned ceased to exist and the respondents have acquired a right to be put in possession thereof under the said proviso The argument proceeds that under the Constitution the <ORG> may make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and also in respect of any matters enumerated in List III thereof that under Art the executive power of the <ORG> extends to the said matters and that therefore the requisition of property made for any of the purposes connected with such matters whether in regard thereof laws were made or not would be a requisition for a public purpose being a purpose of the <ORG> within the meaning of of the Act There is a fallacy underlying this argument The criterion is not therefore whether a particular purpose for which a building was used when the Act came into force was a public purpose being the purpose of the <ORG> within the meaning of of the Act but whether it was requisitioned for one of the purposes mentioned in A of the Rules In this view we do not propose to express our opinion on the validity of the contention raised by the learned Attorney General based upon the decision of this Court
