The material facts are as follows The Defendants carried on business in Calcutta the Plaintiffs in New York and Messrs There is a clause on the face of the document as follows This order is given Subject to war conditions and to such regulations governing purchase and shipment as may be established by the United States or other Governments and you are free of responsibility if unable to export the goods If there is any delay in shipping we will promptly advise you There was at that time much difficulty in getting the goods in New York Payment for the goods was made by the Plaintiffs to Messrs This sum the Plaintiffs claimed in the suit alleging that the Defendants were bound to identify the Plaintiffs against the loss which they had incurred The first ground on which the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs relied was that there was no express direction to the Plaintiffs to ship from New York The second point urged by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs was that there was a doubt as to the meaning of the instructions contained in the indent that the instructions were susceptible of two different meanings that the Plaintiffs had bona fide adopted one of them and had acted upon it and consequently the Defendants could not repudiate the Plaintiffs act as unauthorised The Plaintiffs had agents in Calcutta there was nothing to prevent the Plaintiffs cabling or communicating otherwise with their agents or with the Defendants and obtaining the instructions of the Defendants The fourth point urged on behalf of the Plaintiffs was in my opinion the most important one It was argued that the contract was one between principals and agents that the clause New York was not a condition which went to the root of the contract that the Plaintiffs bad substantially carried out the instructions contained in the indent and that the failure to ship the goods at New York was merely a breach of the contract which sounded in damages and did not entitle the Defendants to refuse to accept the documents or the goods It was argued on behalf of the Defendants that the contract in this case was one between vendor and purchaser and reliance was placed upon the opinion of <ORG> in Ireland <NAME> The learned Judge pointed out that although the legal effect of the transaction between a commission merchant such as the Plaintiffs and the consignee who has given him the order is a contract of sale passing the property from one to the other there was also a contract of agency between the parties The contract was a mercantile contract and it must be assumed that the parties being mercantile men did not insert the stipulation as to shipment at New York unless some value or importance was attached thereto and having regard to the nature of the contract and the specific instructions contained therein that the shipment was to be at New York in my judgment this stipulation must be regarded as one which went to the root of the contract and which must be performed before the plaintiffs could claim indemnity from the Defendants But in my judgment it would not be right for the Court to reject the Defendants contention by reason of the absence of such evidence in my opinion it is immaterial to enquire into such a question when once the conclusion is arrived at that the stipulation that the shipment should be at New York was of the essence of the contract and was one which the Plaintiffs were bound to perform before they could claim indemnity from the Defendants No doubt the employer of an agent is bound to indemnify him against the consequences of all lawful acts done by such agent in the exercise of the authority conferred upon him As I have come to the conclusion that the shipment of the goods at Montreal instead of at New York was not in the exercise of any authority conferred upon the Plaintiffs by the Defendants and as the stipulation as to the shipment was in my opinion of the essence of the contract it follows that the Plaintiffs were not entitled to be indemnified by the Defendants The result therefore is that this appeal must be dismissed with costs On that question the learned Judges differed but I do not understand that any learned Judge took the view that if the Defendants view was right as to the meaning of his order he could possibly be held bound to accept a cargo by two ships if he had really stipulated for one to accept a cargo of less than tons if he had really stipulated in such a way as to require tons in any event or if there was any other material discrepancy between the order and the performance in an essential particular It appears to me that these contracts have to be looked at not merely as contracts involving the general principle of indemnity but as contracts with respect to which there is a particular arrangement between the parties as to the time when and the conditions upon which the agent shall get both his indemnity and his commission For those reasons it does not seem to me that the result in this case is different even when the agency feature of the contract is considered from what it would have been if it had been a mere contract of sale between the parties
