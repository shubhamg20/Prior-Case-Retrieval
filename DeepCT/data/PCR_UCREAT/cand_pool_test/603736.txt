PETITIONER STATE OF WEST BENGAL Vs RESPONDENT UNION OF INDIA DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BHUVNESHWAR CJ BENCH <NAME> BHUVNESHWAR CJ IMAM SYED JAFFER SUBBARAO SHAH AYYANGAR RAJAGOPALA MUDHOLKAR CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC RF SC RF SC MV SC RF SC RF SC A RF SC RF SC TO SC SC RF SC SC SC A RF SC SC RF SC RF SC RF SC SC ACT Land Acqusition <ORG> property Coal bearing areasAcquisition by <ORG> power to enact law Indian Constitution if not federal Sovereignty if lies in <ORG>s also Fundamental rights whether can be claimed by <ORG>s Person and Property Connotation of Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act XX of Constitution of India Arts The preamble of the Act did not support the argument that the Act was intended to acquire only the rights of individuals and not those of the <ORG>s in coal bearing areas Even if the Constitution were held to be a <ORG> and the <ORG>s regarded qua the <ORG> as sovereign the power of the <ORG> to legislate in respect of the property situate in the <ORG>s would remain unrestricted Under the Government of India Act the power to compulsorily acquire property was exclusively vested in the Provinces but under the Constitution the <ORG> also has that power If the other provisions of the Constitution in terms of sufficient amplitude confer power for making laws for acquiring <ORG> property the power cannot be defeated because the express power to acquire property generally does not specifically and in terms refer to <ORG> property Power to acquire and requisition property can be exercised concurrently by the <ORG> and the <ORG>s but on that account there can be no conflict in the exercise of the power as such a conflict is prevented by Arts In interpreting a constitutional document provisions conferring legislative power must normally be interpreted liberally and in their widest amplitude There is no indication in the Constitution that the word property in Entry of List III is to be understood in any restricted sense it must accordingly be held to include property belonging to the <ORG>s also Per <NAME> The impugned Act in so far as it confers a power on the <ORG> to acquire lands owned by the <ORG>s including coal mines and coal bearing lands is ultra vires The power to acquire the property of a citizen for a public Purpose is one of the implied powers of the sovereign and Entry List I confer any power on <ORG> to acquire the property of a <ORG> wers a <ORG> <ORG> before <ORG> made a law decla ring that the control of a particular industry by the <ORG> is expedient in the public interest or the <ORG> after such declaration to make such a law for acquisition of <ORG> lands for they deal only with the regulation of an existing industry or an industry that may be started subsequently but not with acquisition of lands No inspiration can be drawn from foreign constitutions or decisions made thereunder in construing the express provisions of our Constitution in the context of its different set up <NAME> <NAME> This is a suit by the State of West Bengal against <ORG> for a declaration that <ORG> is not competent to make a law authorising the Union Government to acquire land and rights in or over land which are vested in a State and that the Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act XX of which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act enacted by the <ORG> and particularly ss and thereof were ultra vires the legislative competance of <ORG> as also for an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding under the provisions of these sections of the Act in respect of the coal bearing lands vested in the plaintiff We have heard counsel for the parties at great length In exercise of its powers under the Act <ORG> by two notifications dated September and January has expressed its intention to prospect for coal lying within the lands which are vested in the plaintiff as aforesaid Disputes and differences have arisen between the plaintiff and the defendant as to the competence of <ORG> to enact the Act and its power to acquire the property of the plaintiff which is a sovereign authority The Written Statement of the defendant does not deny the allegations of fact made in the Plaint but denies the correctness of each and all the submissions or legal contentions as to the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact the Act and as to the power of the defendant to acquire any property of a State Regulation of mines and mineral development under the control of the <ORG> has been declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Whether <ORG> has legislative compe tence to enact a law for compulsory acqui sition by the Union of land and other properties vested in or owned by the <ORG> as alleged in para of the plaint As the amendment sought was not opposed it was granted and an additional issue was raised in these terms Whether Act XX of on its true construc tion applies to lands vested in or owned by the Plaintiff State It will thus appear that the parties are not at issue on any question of fact and the determination of the controversy depends entirely upon the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the scope and effect of the Act As already indicated when the case was opened for the first time by the learned Advocate General of Bengal he proceeded on the basis that the Act purported to acquire the interests of the <ORG> and made his further submission to the effect that <ORG> had no competence to pass an Act which had the effect of affecting or acquiring the interest of the <ORG> The other <ORG>s which have entered appearance through their respective counsel have supported this stand of the plaintiff and have laid particular emphasis on those provisions of the Act which they contend support their contention that the Act did not intend to acquire or in any way affect the interests of the <ORG>s Hence it is proposed to take power to acquire unworked coal bearing areas covered by private leases or prospecting licencees which are found surplus to the production required in the private sector and to work these areas as lessees of <ORG> There is no other existing Central or State Legislation under which the <ORG> has powers to acquire immediately the lessee rights over the coal bearing areas acquired by <ORG> for the additional coal production It is accordingly considered necessary to take powers by fresh legislation to acquire the lessees rights over unworked coal bearing areas on payment of reasonable compensation to the lessees and without affecting <ORG> rights as owner of the minerals or the royalty payable to <ORG> on minerals Besides setting out the policy of the <ORG> in the matter of coal mining industry and the actual state of affairs in relation thereto the <ORG>ment of objects and Reasons contains the crucial words on which particular reliance was placed on behalf of the <ORG>s because <ORG> does not intend to acquire the proprietary rights vested in the <ORG>s A statute as passed by <ORG> is the expression of the collective intention of the legislature as a whole and any statement made by an individual albeit a Minister of the intention and objects of the Act cannot be used to cut down the generality of the words used in the statute The preamble is in these words An act to establish in the economic interest of India greater public control over the coal mining industry and its development by provid ing for the acquisition by the state of unworked land containing or likely to contain coal deposits or of rights in or over such land for the extinguishment or modification of such rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease licence or otherwise and for matters connected therewith Particular stress was laid on the last two lines of the preamble showing that only rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease licence or otherwise were being sought to be extinguished or modified by the provisions of the Act But this argument omits to take note of the words of the previous clause in the preamble which has reference to the fact that the Act also was meant for acquisition by the state of unworked lands containing or likely to contain coal deposits The preamble therefore does not support the argument that the Act was intended to acquire only the rights of individuals derived from prospecting licences or based on leases and to exclude from the purview of the Act the rights of <ORG> in coal bearing lands Section which provides for a declaration of acquisition has also used the same expression any land or any rights in or over such land with the provisions of which provides for hearing any objections raised to the proposal to acquire any land which is notified under as the subject matter of acquisition Section to lay down the method of determining compensation and other cognate matters relating to payment of compensation But it has been argued that on a close examination of the provisions aforesaid of the Act and keeping certain general principles of interpretation of Statutes in view the conclusion follows that the Act does not cover any property or interest in or over land belonging to a State Government It will therefore be convenient to deal with this argument along with that topic It is enough to point out here that the explanation to and particularly the words undertaken by <ORG> or by any other person Would lend support to the argument of the learned AttorneyGeneral that the word Person has been used in the generic sense of including both a natural person and a juristic person Section is the effective section of the Act which provides that after <ORG> has investigated the prospect of obtaining coal after the issue of a notification under and after notifying its intention to acquire the land covered by the notification under and after disposing of objections if any under <ORG> has to make the necessary declaration that that land should be acquired It has rightly been pointed out on behalf of <ORG> that if the right or interest of a <ORG> were not involved in the acquisition it would be wholly unnecessary to make any reference to the <ORG> concerned It was urged that unless lands belonging to a <ORG> or in which a <ORG> has an interest in or over such land were within the operative words of the main provisions in it would be meaningless to Make a provision for the consultation referred to in the proviso We see force in this submission The consultation with the <ORG> is made a condition precedent to the declaration to be made by <ORG> in respect of the proposed acquisition This argument is based on the consideration that if rights or interests of <ORG> were also within the purview of the Act it would be meaningless to provide that <ORG> or a Government Company as contemplated by II should be deemed to be the lessee of <ORG> in respect of the rights acquired It will thus appear that on a proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act it cannot be said that either in express terms or by necessary implication the provisions of the Act are implacable to rights or interests of a <ORG> Government or that such lands are excluded It is plain that the Act is intended to cover land or rights in or over land belonging either to an individual or to a juristic person The Act may have been more artistically drafted but construing it as it is we have no doubt that <ORG> intended to acquire all rights and interests in coal bearing land with a view to prospecting for coal and for exploiting coal bearing mines Starting with the position that on a true construction of the relevant provisions of the Act the rights and interests of a <ORG> Government in coal bearing land had not been excluded from the operation of the Act either in express terms or by necessary implication the next question that arises for consideration is the first issue which covers issues and also The competence of <ORG> to enact the Act has to be determined with reference to specific provisions of the Constitution with particular reference to the entries in the Seventh ScheduleList I and List III power to legislate in respect of acquisition and requisition of property is conferrcd upon the <ORG> as well as the <ORG> Legislatures Prima facie this power may be exercised by the <ORG> in respect of all property privately owened or <ORG> owned The Government of India Act provided special machinery for acquisition of property of the State by negotiations and not by compulsion in exercise of legislative power that provision recognised that <ORG> had no power to acquire property of the State by exercise of legislative power and even though no provision similar to of the Government of India Act has been enacted in the Constitution the recognition implicit in that provision of the immunity of the property of the units must also be deemed to be superimposed upon the exercise of legislative power vested in the <ORG> under the Constitution If power be exercised by the <ORG> to acquire <ORG> property under Entry of the Concurrent List similar power may also be exercised by the <ORG>s in respect of <ORG> property and even to re acquire the property from the <ORG> by exercise of the <ORG> legislative power of the Constitution that acquisition of their property will be for public purposes and compensation will be awarded for acquiring property and inasmuch as Fundamental rights are conferred upon individuals and Corporations against executive or legislative actions and <ORG>s are not invested with any fundamental rights exerciseable against the <ORG> or other <ORG>s the right to legislate for compulsory acquisition of <ORG> property cannot be exercised Unless a law expressly or by necessary implication so provides a <ORG> is not bound thereby Therefore in the absence of any provision express or necessarly implying that the property of the <ORG> could be acquired by the <ORG> the rights claimed by the <ORG> to legislate for acquisition of <ORG> property must be negatived By the Indian Independence Act a separate Dominion of India was carved out and by thereof the <ORG> was for the first time authorised to make laws for the Dominion Such laws were not to be void or inoperative on the ground that they were repugnant to the law of England or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom or to any order rule or regulation made under any such Act and the powers of the <ORG> of the Dominion included the power to repeal or amend any such Act order rule or regulation There is no warrant for the assumption that the Provinces were sovereign autunomous units which had parted with such power as they considered reasonable or proper for enabling <ORG> to function for the common good There is undoubtedly distribution of powers between the <ORG> and the <ORG> in matters legislative and executive but distribution of powers is not always an index of political sovereignty The exercise of executive authority by the <ORG> or by the <ORG> and rights and obligations arising out of the executive authority are subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts which have territorial jurisdiction in respect of the cause of action <ORG> has superintendence over all courts in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction which enacts that subject to the provisions of the Constitution the executive power of the <ORG> extends to the matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws and to the exercise of such rights authority and jurisdiction as are cxercisable by <ORG> by virtue of any treaty or agreement But this executive power may not save as expressly provided in the Constitution or in any law made by <ORG> extend in any <ORG> to matters with respect to which <ORG> has also power to make laws subject to the provisions of the Constitution executive power of the <ORG> extends to matters with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws subject to the restriction that in matters in the Con current List of the Seventh Schedule exercise of executive power of the <ORG> is also subject to and limited by the executive power expressly conferred by the Constitution or by any law made by <ORG> upon the <ORG> or authorities thereof Exercise of executive authority of the <ORG>s is largely restricted by diverse Constitutional provisions authorises the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the <ORG> of a <ORG> cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution if the <ORG> fails to comply with or give effect to any directions given in exercise of the executive power of the <ORG> In respect of matters set out in List I of the Seventh Schedule <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws in respect of matters set out in List the <ORG> has exclusive power to Legislate and in respect of matters set out in List III <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG> have concurrent power to legislate Article authorises the <ORG> to legislate with respect to any matter in the <ORG> List if the Council of <ORG>s has declared by resolution supported by not less than two third of the members present and voting that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest that it <ORG> should make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in the <ORG> List specified in the resolution power is conferred upon <ORG> to legislate for two or more <ORG>s by consent even though the <ORG> may have no power under Art between the laws made by <ORG> and laws made by the <ORG>s of the <ORG>s the laws made by the <ORG> whether passed before or after the <ORG> law in matters enumerated in the Concurrent List to the extent of repugnancy prevail over the <ORG> laws imposition of a tax on sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the <ORG> or in the course of import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India can only be imposed by <ORG>ary legislation A share in certain taxes levied and collected by the <ORG> such as tax on non agricultural income duties in respect of succession to property other than agricultural land estate duty in respect of property other than agri cultural land terminal taxes on goods or passengers carried by railway sea or air taxes on railway fares and freights taxes on the sale or purchase of newspapers and on advertisements published therein taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce is given to the States but the same cannot be exercised without the consent of <ORG> if there is still outstanding any part of a loan which has been made to the State by <ORG> or by its predecessor <ORG> or in respect of which a guarantee has been given by the <ORG> or by its predecessor When a State of emergency is declared the <ORG> has power to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India with respect to any matter in the State List and the laws made by <ORG> prevail over the State Laws in the event of repugnancy If as a result of war external aggression or internal disturbances the security of India or any territory is threatened the President may declare a state of emergency and the executive power of the <ORG> will thereupon extend to giving directions to the States as to manner in which the executive power of the States is to be exercised and the power of the <ORG> to make laws will extend to making laws conferring or authorising conferment of powers and imposition of duties upon the <ORG> or its officers and authorities as respect any matter even if such matter be not enumerated in the <ORG> List The normal corporate existence of <ORG> entitles them to enter into contracts and invests them with power to carry on trade or business and the <ORG> have the right to hold property There is no constitutional guarantee against alteration of the boundaries of the <ORG> the <ORG> is by law authorised to form a new <ORG> by redistribution of the territory of a <ORG> or by uniting two or more <ORG> or parts of <ORG> or by uniting any territory to a part of any <ORG> increase the area of any <ORG> diminish the area of any <ORG> alter the boundaries of any <ORG> and alter the name of any <ORG> The parliamentary power of legislation to acquire property is subject to the express provisions of the Constitution unrestricted That the <ORG> may in the ordinary course not seek to obstruct the normal exercise of the powers which the <ORG> have both legislative and executive in the field allotted to them will not be a ground for holding that the <ORG> has no such power if it desires in exercise of the powers which we have summarisedted do so The following passage in the judgment of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> case though it dealt with the converse case of not reading limitations into provincial power might usefully be set out The appellant invokes that principle to support the conclusion that the Federation Act must be so construed as to allow no power to the provincial legislatures under sect And the ques tion they have to answer is whether the one body or the other has power to make a given law Entry Ports declared by or under law made by <ORG> or existing law to be major ports Entry Airways aircraft and air navigation provision of aerodynamic etc Entry Carriage of passengers and goods by railways sea or air or by national waterways in mechanically propelled vessels Entry Property of the <ORG> and the Revenue therefrom but as regards property situated in a State subject to legislation by the State save in so far as <ORG> by law otherwise provides Entry Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry Regulation and development of oilfields and mineral oil resources petroleum and petroleum products other liquids and substances declared by <ORG> by law to be dangerously inflammable Entry Regulation of mines and mineral development Entry Regulation and development of inter State rivers and rivervalleys Entry Ancient and historical monuments and records and archaeological sites and remains declared to be of national importance Entry There is no room in our scheme of government for the assertion of <ORG> power in hostility to the authorized exercise of <ORG> power This is not to say that the nation may deal with the internal concerns of the <ORG> as such but that the execution by <ORG> of its constitutional power to regulate inter state commerce is not limited by the fact that intrastate transactions may have become so interwoven therewith that the effective government of the former incidentally controls the latter The power to acquire land sought to be exercised by the <ORG> which is challenged by the State of West Bengal is power to acquire in exercise of authority conferred by ss and of the Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act The Act was enacted for establishing in the economic interest of India greater public control over the coal mining industry and its development by providing for the acquisition by the State of land containing or likely to contain coal deposits or of rights in or over such land for the extinguishment or modification of such rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease licence or otherwise and for matters connected therewith By Entries and of List I the <ORG> is given power to legislate in respect of Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to the expedient in the public interest By of the Act it was declared that it was expedient in the public interest that <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and oilfields and development of minerals to the extent specified in the Act Mine was defined under the Act as meaning any excavation for the purpose of searching for or obtaining minerals and includes an oil well By it was declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule The Act deals with all minerals except oil and enacts certain amendments in Act LIII of There being a declaration in terms of item the <ORG> acquired exclusive authority to legislate in respect of Coal industry set out in the Schedule to Act of and the <ORG> Government had no authority in that behalf In the American Constitution there is no express power conferred upon the <ORG> to make a law for acquisition of any property for a public purpose It was observed The Tenth Amendment does not deprive the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end United <ORG>s <NAME> Since the construction of this dam and reservoir is a valid exercise by <ORG> of its commerce power there is no interference with the sovereignty or the <ORG> Similarly it was held in <ORG> <ORG> that <ORG> has the power to authorise a <ORG> to construct a railway through the territory of the Cherokee Nation for the United <ORG>s may exercise the right of eminent domain even within the limits of the several <ORG>s for purposes necessary to the execution of powers granted to the general government by the Constitution If the right to acquire property for such uses may be made a barren right by the unwillingness of property holders to sell or by the action of a <ORG> prohibiting a sale to <ORG> the constitutional grants of power may be rendered nugatory and the <ORG> is dependent for its practical existence upon the will of a <ORG> or even upon that of a private citizen In the United <ORG>s of America power to take private property for public use is called by American lawyers eminent domain The judicial Committee observed at It was argued for the appellant that these enactments ought not to be so construed as to enable <ORG> to dispose of Provincial Crown lands for the purposes mentioned It is not considered as inconsistent with a true federation like Australia to have a provision like of the <ORG> of Australia Act which specifically empowers the <ORG> to acquire <ORG> property if needed for a <ORG> purpose on terms of payment of compensation In this connection it is to be noticed that there is under the <ORG> of Australia Act a provision as regards vesting of property in <ORG>s and in the <ORG> on lines somewhat similar to Art In these circumstances we are unable to appreciate the argument that if the Constitution were to be held to be a Federation the <ORG>s being considered as the federative units such a status necessarily involved a prohibition or negation of the right of the <ORG> to acquire the property of the <ORG> for the purpose of giving effect to its legislative powers Therefore the power of the <ORG> to legislate in respect of property situate in the <ORG>s even if the <ORG>s are regarded qua the <ORG> as Sovereign remains unrestricted and the <ORG> property is not immune from its operation It was pointed out by the learned Attorney General that so far as the plaintiff the <ORG> of West Bengal was concerned it did not own the coal bearing lands on the date of the Constitution and that it got title thereto only after the vested in the <ORG> by virtue of the provisions of the Bengal Acquisition of Estates Act of We have no doubt that this would be an answer to the claim of the plaintiff in this suit and particularly in the context of the challenge to the validity of the notification now impugned but we do not desire to rest our decision on any such narrow ground Confers on <ORG>s the power to acquire or dispose of property the reference is to the executive power of the <ORG> to acquire or dispose of property which would apply without distinction to property vested under Art is merely an enabling Article conferring on the <ORG> as owner of the property the power of disposal Up to April st when the greater part of the Act came into force <ORG> was a unitary Government to which all the Provincial Governments were subordinate and hence all lands and buildings belonging to Government or used for governmental purposes of were vested in His Majesty for the purpose of <ORG> All lands and buildings which imme diately before the commencement of Part III of this Act were vested in His Majesty for the purpose of the Government of India shall as from that date a in the case of lands and buildings which are situate in a Province vest in His Majesty for the purposes of the government of that Province unless they were then used otherwise than under a tenancy agreement between the Governor General in Council and the Government of that Province for purposes which thereafter will be purposes of the Federal Government or of His Majesty Representative for the exercise of the functions of the <ORG> in its relations with Indian States or unless they are lands and buildings formerly used for such purposes is fore said or intended or formerly intended to be so used and are certified by the Governor General in Council or as the case may be His Majesty Representative to have been retained for future use for such purposes or to have been retained temporarily for the purpose of more advantageous disposal by sale or otherwise just like being the forerunner of Art The right of the Provinces to continue to retain and enjoy their property so vested was further emphasized by which read By reason of Provincial Crown Lands being vested in the appellant by of the Imperial Act read with II the Provinces were entitled to retain their respective property not otherwise disposed of by the Act and that the purpose for which the Railways Act made provision did not fall within the last limb of vesting in <ORG> a right to take property for certain limited purposes <NAME> quoted the passage in the judgment we have already extracted and continued It was argued that the effect of ss and of the British North America Act was to vest in each of the Provinces the beneficial Interest in the Crown land situate in the Province subject only to the right of Canada under the reservation contained in to assume lands required for purposes of defence But the reservation in question appears to refer to executive and not to legislative action and while the proprietary right of each Province in its own Crown lands is beyond dispute that right is subject to be affected by legislation passed by <ORG> within the limits of the authority conferred on that <ORG> where the legislative power cannot be effectually exercised without affecting the proprietary rights both of individuals in a Province and of <ORG> the power so to affect those rights is necessarily involved in the legislative power Power to acquire land was vested under the Government of India Act by Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule exclusive <ORG> may if it deems it necessary to acquire any land situate in a Province for any purpose connected with a matter with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws require the province to acquire the land on behalf and at the expense of the <ORG> or if the land belongs to the Province to transfer it to the <ORG> on such terms as may be agreed or in default of agreement as may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief justice of India What however is of relevance is the presence of in that enactment which empowered <ORG> to require the Provinces to part with property owned by them if the same was needed for the purposes of <ORG> A closer examination of the scheme of distribution of legislative power in regard to compulsory acquisition of property under the Government of India Act discloses that though the power to compulsorily acquire property was exclusively vested in the Provinces <ORG> could satisfy its requirements of property for Central purpose by utilising provincial machinery and that it was in that context that a specific provision referring to the Provinces having at the direction of <ORG> to transfer provincial property was needed If the other provisions of our Constitution in terms of sufficient amplitude confer power for enacting legislation for acquiring State property authority to exercise that power cannot be defeated because the express power to acquire property generally does not specifically and in terms refer to State property In the Constitution of India as originally enacted there was an elaborate division of powers by providing three entries relating to acquisition and requisition of property Power to acquire or requisition property may since the amendment be exercised concurrently by the <ORG> and the <ORG>s Article Which deals with acquisition of all property requires two conditions to be fulfilled acquisition or requisitioning must be for a public purpose the law under which the property is acquired or requisitioned must provide for payment of compensation either fixed thereby or on principles specified thereby no such law as is referred to in cl made by the legislature of a <ORG> shall have efficacy unless such law has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent By cl of that Article if a law made by the legislature of a <ORG> is repugnant to any provision of a law competently made by <ORG> the <ORG> lady is subject to cl Vold Clause recognises limited validity of a <ORG> law on matters in the Concurrent List if that law is repugnant to an existing or earlier law made by <ORG> only it such law has been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent Article gives protection to the rights of persons and a <ORG> is not a person within the meaning of that Article all laws in force before the Constitution to the extent of inconsistency with Ch III are declared void and by cl the <ORG> is prohibited from making any law which takes away or abridges fundamental rights and the laws made in contravention of the prohibition are void Some of these rights are declared in form positive but subject to the restric tions authorising the <ORG> to make laws derogating from the fullness of the protection there arc certain articles which merely declared rights and and there are others merely prohibitory without reference to the right of any person body or agency to enforce them and The rights declared in the form of prohibition must have a concomitant positive content without such positive content they could be worthless There are still other Articles in the form not of rights but fundamental disabilities Article is couched in negative form but recognises the existence of at least one important power vested in every sovereign State not by virtue of its Constitution but springing from its very existence as a State viz the power to acquire property for public purposes on payment of compensation which the American jurists call eminent domain was amended by the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act there was conflict of opinion in this Court as to the interrelation of cl and read as follows No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that the compen sation provided by that law is not adequate A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprived any person of his property The clause grants protection in terms of widest amplitude against compulsory acquisition or requisition of property and there is nothing in the Article which indicates that the property protected is to be of individuals or corporations It was observed at The immunity of Government from the operation of certain statutes and particularly statutes creating offences is based upon the funda mental concept that the Government or its officers cannot be a party to committing a crime analogous to the prerogative of perfec tion that the King can do no wrong In considering the true meaning of words or expression used by the <ORG> the <ORG> must have regard to the aim object and scope of the statute to be read in its entirety Again in interpreting a Constitutional document provisions conferring legislative power must normally be interpreted liberally I A Again denial of power to <ORG> to legislate on allotted topics of legislation in a manner affecting the property vested in a <ORG> may render <ORG> legislation virtually ineffective No provision in the Constitution suggesting a restricted meaning of the word property in the context of legislative power has been brought to our notice Power to legislate for regulation and development of mines and minerals under the control of the <ORG> would by necessary implication include the power to acquire mines and minerals Power to legislate for acquisition of property vested in the States cannot therefore be denied to the <ORG> if it be exercised consistently with the protection afforded by Art The following findings will accordingly be recorded on the issues Issue in the affirmative The suit will therefore stand dismissed with costs SUBBA RAO I regret my inability to agree The summary of the pleadings and the issues raised thereon are set out in the judgment of the learned Chief justice and I need not restate them The Advocate General of Punjab while supporting the argument of the Advocate General of West Bengal also raised an alternative contention namely that if the acquisition of <ORG> property was necessarily incidental to the effective exercise of any of the powers conferred on <ORG> under Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution it could make a law for acquiring such property provided it did not interfere with the exercise of the governmental functions of the <ORG> and that the power to acquire land of the <ORG> was not necessarily incidental to the regulation of mines Learned Government pleader for the <ORG> of Bihar supported the <ORG> of India in its contention that <ORG> can make a law providing for the acquisition of <ORG> property by virtue of entry of List III In any event he contended the impugned law could be made by <ORG> by virtue of Art Article demarcates the legislative fields with precision and emphasizes the exclusive power of the <ORG> and the <ORG> to make laws in respect of the matters enumerated in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule and allotted to the <ORG> or the <ORG> as the case may be The legislative field of the <ORG> is much wider than that of the <ORG> and in case of conflict in the common field allotted to them the <ORG> law generally prevails over the <ORG> law The executive powers of the <ORG> as well as of the <ORG> extend to matters in respect of which they have power to make laws though the executive of the <ORG> can give directions to a <ORG> to ensure compliance with the laws made by <ORG> and any The expenditure of the <ORG> judiciary is charged on the consolidated fund of the <ORG> concerned but the judges of <ORG> are appointed by the President and appeals lie to <ORG> in certain matters and it has also extraordinary powers to entertain appeals in other matters or to issue writs to enforce fundamental rights In financial matters though the <ORG> and the <ORG> have consolidated funds of their own the sources allotted to the <ORG> are comparatively meagre and those allotted to the <ORG> appear to be perennial the <ORG> also depend upon the <ORG> for allocation of funds from and out of the taxes collected by it and also for grants though there is no direct control by the <ORG> over the field of finance of the <ORG> there will always be indirect pressure on the <ORG> in that field The <ORG> being in charge of the purse strings can always to use an euphemistic term pursuade the <ORG> to take its advice In case of emergencies such as war external aggression internal disturbances failure of the constitutional machinery and financial instability extraordinary powers are conferred on the <ORG> subject to certain limitations to interfere with the <ORG> administration but the provisions relating to emergency situations are really in the nature of safety valves to protect the country future to the extent it exercises its legislative powers the <ORG>s also have control over the <ORG> Though on paper the American Constitution is a typical federation in practice <ORG> of the United <ORG>s of America by evolving and developing many legal doctrines and implied powers has invested <ORG> with large powers to enable it to interfere indirectly in the <ORG>s field It is therefore clear that in every federal Constitution there are either textually or customarily some unitary elements Though some authors accepting the American Constitution as the yardstick for a federation prefer to describe <ORG> with a bias towards <ORG> as quasi federations I do not think it is inappropriate to describe all <ORG> which substantially accept the federal principle as <ORG>s Applying this test I have no doubt that the Indian Constitution is a federation as the units in normal times exercise exclusive sovereign powers within the fields allotted to them Historically before the advent of the Constitution there were different Provinces enjoying in practice a fair amount of autonomy and there were innumerable States with varying forms of government ranging from pure autocracy to guided democracy There were also differences in language race religion etc With this background I shall now proceed to consider the arguments advanced by learned counsel Article Notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List Notwithstanding anything in clause <ORG> and subject to clause the <ORG> of any State also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Concurrent List Subject to clauses and the <ORG> of a State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the State List No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property shall be compulsorily acq uired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that is not adequate A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property No such law as is referred to in clause made by <ORG> State shall effect unless such law having been reserved or the consideration of the President has received his assent I have already held that the sovereign powers have been distributed between the constitutional entities namely the <ORG> and the States one such sovereign power is the power to acquire or requisition the property of a citizen for a public purpose It is therefore clear that the power to acquire the property of a citizen for a public purpose is one of the implied powers of the sovereign Now both <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG> can make a law providing for the acquisition and requisitioning of property for <ORG> or <ORG> purposes applies also to a law of acquisition of a <ORG> property by the <ORG> the result will be that <ORG> can make a law providing for the acquisition of a property of a <ORG> for a purpose which is not a public purpose and without payment of compensation while it cannot do so in the case of acquisition of a private property does not govern the law of acquisition of a <ORG> property it indicates that entry of List III does not deal with acquisition of a <ORG> property for otherwise it would lead to the anomaly of acquisition of a <ORG> property by a law of <ORG> without safeguards inherent in the doctrine of Eminent Domain That is why the learned Attorney General made an attempt to persuade us to hold that Art applies also to a law providing for the acquisition of a <ORG> property reads No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate Clause A thereof reads Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property Article deals with a fundamental right in regard to property cl That is made clear by cl A which says that the law of acquisition shall provide for the transfer of ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> if that was the intention it would have provided expressly for a transfer between a <ORG> and a <ORG> Indeed there is no other article in this part wherein the expression person is used in the sense of <ORG> There is nothing in the said Article which compels me to give a strained meaning particularly when the Article is consistent with the recognized concept of Eminent Domain and fits in squarely with the scheme of fundamental rights There is no definition of the expression person in the Constitution but it is defined in the General Clauses Act as including any company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not Though that rule has been laid down in the context of a statute there is no reason why a different principle should apply in the construction of the Articles of the Constitution A plaintiff may apply to the court for a temporary injunction to restrain a defendant from committing the injury complained of such terms the <ORG> granting an injunction may order the property Of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach to be attached and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison for a term not In the Government of India Act acquisition was a provincial subject being entry of List Section of the Government of India Act read No person shall be deprived of his property in British India save by authority of law Neither the <ORG> nor <ORG> shall have power to make any law authorising the compulsory acquisition for public purposes of any land or any commercial or industrial undertaking or any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking unless the law provides for the payment of compensation for the property acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which it is to be determined of the Constitution under the said Act the <ORG> Legislature could not make a law acquiring the land of a Province for the simple reason that the subject of acquisition of land was exclusively a Provincial subject The section read The <ORG> may if it deems it necessary to acquire any land situate in a Province for any purpose connected with a matter with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws require the Province to acquire the land on behalf and at the expense of the <ORG> or if the land belongs to the Province to transfer it to the <ORG> on such terms as may be agreed or in default of agreement as may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice of India A combined reading of the said provisions indicates that though under the Government of India Act the federal <ORG> could not make a law empowering the <ORG> to acquire the land belonging to a Province the <ORG> may require the Province to transfer to it the land owned by the Province on terms agreed upon between them or in default of agreement determined by an arbitrator that is to say under the Government of India Act transfer of lands owned by a Province to the <ORG> could be effected only under an agreement or an award Under the Constitution before it was amended in <ORG> as well as <ORG> <ORG>s were empowered to make laws for acquisition of lands for their respective purposes <ORG> for the <ORG> purposes and a <ORG> <ORG> for the purposes of the <ORG> The said article read The executive power of the <ORG> and of each State shall extend subject to any law made by the appropriate <ORG> to the grant sale disposition or mortgage of any property held for the purposes of the <ORG> or of such State as the case may be and to the purchase or acquisition of property for those purposes respectively and to the making of contracts It is therefore manifest that under the Government of India Act compulsory acquisition of land was a provincial subject that tinder the Constitution as it originally stood <ORG> could make a law for acquiring such a property for the <ORG> purposes and the <ORG> Legislature for the <ORG> purposes by virtue of different entries and that after the amendment both <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> could make a law for the acquisition of such a property by virtue of entry of List Article reads Parliament has exclusive power to make any law with respect of any matter not enumerated in the concurrent List or State List Such power shall include the power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in either of those Lists It is contended that if acquisition of a <ORG> property does not fall under entry of List III it must fall under entry of List Emphasis is laid upon the words any matter in Art and a contention is advanced that the expression any matter has the widest connotation and therefore it empowers the <ORG> to make a law in regard to any subject including taking over of the property of a <ORG> There are two answers to this argument firstly a residuary entry cannot travel beyond the scope of the division of powers As the subject of acquisition and requisitioning is in the Concurrent List both <ORG> and <ORG> can make different laws for acquiring the property of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> as the case may be of the Constitution which says No such law as is referred to in clause made by <ORG> State shall have effect unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent has no application to a law providing for the acquisition of a <ORG> property and if so cl thereof will also not apply to such a law applies there is nothing which prevents the President from giving his consent to a <ORG> to acquire the <ORG> property though the <ORG> executive may ordinarily be relied upon not to do so can come in aid of the law made by <ORG> only if there is repugnancy between that law and that made by <ORG> But in the illustration given there is no such repugnancy for the law made by <ORG> provides for the acquisition of the property of the <ORG> whereas the law made by the <ORG> provides for the acquisition of the property owned by the <ORG> In such a context there is no repugnancy between the two laws though the purpose of the <ORG> law can be defeated by the exercise of a power under a <ORG> law Article also saves the laws of the <ORG>s if the previous consent of the President has been taken such a consent is legally possible though ordinarily the Central Executive can beexpected to withhold it Secondly if the contention of the <ORG> be correct <ORG> can make a law making a provision for acquiring the entire property of a <ORG> without compensation A construction which may prevent the <ORG> from functioning as visualized by the Constitution cannot easily be accepted unless it is clearly expressed in the Constitution itself Such a power is expressly given to the <ORG> and therefore it can function under that Article But that has nothing to do with a power to acquire the property of a <ORG> of the Constitution all the coal mines vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Province vested in the <ORG> of West Bengal as from the commencement of the Constitution and that therefore unless there is an express constitutional provision for divesting them they could not be acquired by a law made by <ORG> I shall consider the decisions cited at the <ORG> in this context at a later stage If the argument advanced on behalf of the <ORG> is correct viz that there is a legislative power in the <ORG> to acquire the property of a <ORG> Art cannot be in the way of the <ORG> law providing for the acquisition of the <ORG> property They read Entry of List I Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry of List I Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest But if <ORG> makes a law declaring that any particular industry should be under the control of the <ORG> in public interests or the regulations of any mines or mineral development should be under its control to that extent entries and of List II shall yield to entries and of List I Under the industries Development and Regulation Act <ORG> has declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule which include coal and therefore it is argued the subject of coal industry passed on to parliament and the impugned Act made thereafter for acquisition of coal bearing lands was well within its power If I may say so there is a fallacy in this argument As I have held that entry of List III does not enable <ORG> to make a law providing for the acquisition of a property of a State entry of list I cannot be relied upon for such a purpose Reliance is also placed upon the Coal Mines Conservation and Safety Act Act XII of in support of the contention that the declaration contained therein gave vitality to entry of List I and that the impugned Act could be sustained under that entry Section of that Act says It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of coal mines to the extent hereinafter provided Further under the entry regulation of mines a law cannot be made for the acquisition of coal bearing lands themselves particularly when there is a specific entry for acquisition Nor can the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act of be successfully invoked in this case for that Act which contains a declaration that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided therein was passed on December whereas the impugn Act was passed on June Australian and Canadian decision in support of the <ORG> contention that a federal law can provide for the acquisition of a property owned by a <ORG> In America there is no express power conferred on the <ORG> enabling it to make a law for the acquisition of any property for public purposes There is also no concurrent List giving a common field of operation for the <ORG> and the <ORG> units The law of that country therefore may not be of much relevance in construing the provisions conferring express powers on the different units under our Constitution It was observed therein Since the construction of this dam and reser voir is a valid exercise by <ORG> of its commerce power there is no interference with the sovereignty of the <ORG> It was pointed out that Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign nation but was under the political control of the government of the United States and therefore it could not be said that the right of eminent domain within its territory could only be exercised by it and not by the United States It was observed therein The lands in the Cherokee territory like the lands held by private owners everywhere within the geographical limits of the United <ORG>s are held subject to the authority of the general government to take them for such objects as are germane to the execution of the powers granted to it provided only that they are not taken without I just compensation being made to the owner the following passage appears Despite the phraseology of the Fifth Amend ment to the Constitution of the United States to the effect that private property shall not be taken for public use except upon payment of just compensation it has been held that there is no implied limitation therefrom which inhibits the taking of public property by the federal government and the latter may acquire the property of a state or one of its agencies or sub divisions Although the federal government has the power to acquire such property the relative positions of the federal and state governments are such that it would seem that the United <ORG>s could not for the sake of mere con veniencc take the property of a state which was devoted to the public use the loss of which would seriously cripple the state in carrying on its functions In case of necessity as distinguished from mere convenience the <ORG> would have to yield in any event The said discussion shows that the law in America on the question raised in the present case is not clear The Australian decisions also do not help us for of the Australian Constitution expressly provides that the Commonwealth can make a law for the acquisition of property on just terms from any <ORG> or person see <NAME> Legislative Executive and judicial Powers in Australia It may be mentioned that in Canada there is no concurrent List conferring the power of eminent domain expressly on both the <ORG> and the constituent States Reliance is placed on behalf of the <ORG> on the decision of <ORG> in Attorney General for the <ORG> of Canada Attorney General for the Provinces of Ontario Quebec and Nova Scotia The questions raised in the appeal were whether under the river was transferred to the <ORG> and whether the <ORG> could make a law under affecting fisheries and fishing rights in the river This decision supports the broad contention of the learned Advocate General of West Bengal that the properties vested in a State cannot be taken over by the <ORG> in exercise of a legislative power The Canadian decision do not support the wide contention of the learned Attorney General that properties vested in a State can be acquired by <ORG> law by virtue of either entry of List III or entry of List I of our Constitution The legislative fields allotted to the units cover subjects for legislation and they do not deal with the relationship between the two co ordinate units functioning in their allotted fields this is regulated by other provisions of the Constitution and there is no provision which enables one unit to take away the property of another except by agreement I would therefore hold that the impugned Act in so far as it confers a power on the <ORG> to acquire the lands owned by the <ORG> including coal mines and coa bearing lands is ultra vires By <ORG> In view of the judgment of the majority the suit stands dismissed with costs
