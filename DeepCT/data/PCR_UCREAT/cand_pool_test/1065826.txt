The appellant was charged with the breach of Standard Standing Order under the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Employment Standing Orders Rules which governed the matter and he was dismissed after a domestic enquiry On his application under Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act the <ORG> held that the enquiry was defective as it infringed principles of natural justice but came to the conclusion after considering the evidence adduced before it by the parties that the dismissal was justified In appeal to this Court it was contended by the appellant that the charge did not amount to a major misconduct under the Standing Orders and the <ORG> having found that there was no proper domestic enquiry should have ordered payment of wages till the date of the decision by the <ORG> Since it was the duty of the appellant as a Ticket Examiner to check whether the conductor had collected fare from all the passengers and in token thereof had issued tickets to them a chargesheet was served on the appellant for breach of clauses and of the Madhya Pradesh Standard Standing Orders which govern the matter by reason of Rule of the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Employment Standing Orders Rules On December the appellant filed an application in <ORG> Jabalpur under section of the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act challenging the validity of the inquiry on various grounds and praying that the order of dismissal be set aside and that an order of reinstatement be passed with back wages By a preliminary order dated December <ORG> held that the Domestic tribunal did not hold a proper inquiry into the charges levelled against the appellant but that it was open to the parties to lead evidence before it on the merits of the case and to satisfy it whether the appellant was guilty of the charges and further whether the conduct of the appellant was such as to call for an order of dismissal Parties thereafter led evidence before <ORG> on a consideration of which it held by an order dated August that the appellant was guilty of the charges levelled against him and that in the circumstances of the case the punishment of dismissal was neither harsh nor unjust The appellant thereafter filed a petition in <ORG> under articles and of the Constitution challenging the order of <ORG> The appellant has filed this appeal in forma pauperis by special leave of this <ORG> Sasa Musa Sugar Works Ltd was further extended to a case of an adjudication under of the Act and it was pointed out that if there was any defect in the enquiry by the employer he could make good that defect by producing necessary evidence before the tribunal but in that case he will have to pay the wages up to the date of the award of the tribunal even if the award went in his favour <ORG> took the view that the employee contention that the Station Manager was biased against him could not be brushed aside lightly but it went on to hold that even if there was some violation the principles of natural justice on account of the bias of the Inquiry Officer the Company was entitled to adduce as it did all the evidence before it in support of its action and therefore it was open to <ORG> to decide on that evidence whether the action was justified and whether the approval to the order of dismissal should be granted In an appeal by special leave against the decision of <ORG> it was contended in this Court on behalf of the employee that since the Domestic inquiry was found defective <ORG> even if it was of the opinion that the dismissal was justified should have ordered the dismissal from the date of its award and not from the date when the Regional Representative passed the order of dismissal Rejecting this contention this Court held The present is a case where the employer has held an inquiry though it was defective and has passed an order of dismissal and seeks approval of that order If the inquiry is not defective <ORG> has only to see whether there was a prima facie case for dismissal and whether the employer had come to the bona fide conclusion that the employee was guilty of misconduct If the inquiry is defective for any reason <ORG> would also have to consider for itself on the evidence adduced before it whether the dismissal was justified These observations directly cover the case before us because though <ORG> in the instant case found that the inquiry was defective as it infringed the principles of natural justice it came to the conclusion after considering the evidence adduced before it that the dismissal was justified Learned counsel for the respondent took us closely through the judgment in Phulbari Tea Estate but we are unable to find anything in that judgment showing that whenever there is a defect in a Domestic inquiry the employer would have to pay wages up to the date of the award of <ORG> or <ORG> even if the order passed in the Domestic inquiry was ultimately upheld by <ORG> or the <ORG> Since the inquiry was bad and the <ORG> had no evidence before it to sustain the order of dismissal it set aside that order but held that in the peculiar circumstances of the case the employee may be granted the alternative relief of compensation instead of an order of reinstatement The <ORG> accordingly granted to the employee pay and allowance from the date of his suspension till payment In the instant case the <ORG> inquiry was held to be in violation of the principles of natural justice but the employer led evidence before the Labour <ORG> in support of the order of dismissal and on a fresh appraisal of that evidence the Labour <ORG> found that the order of dismissal was justified As pointed out by this Court in <NAME> case <NAME> was a case where an application had been made under section of the Industrial Disputes Act for permission to dismiss the employees and such permission was asked for though no inquiry whatsoever was held by the employer and no decision was taken that the employees be dismissed The case for dismissal of the employees was made out for the first time in the proceedings under section and it was for that reason that it was held that the employees were entitled to back wages until the decision of the application filed under section We would however like to add that the decision in <NAME> case is not to be construed as a charter for employers to dismiss employees after the pretence of an inquiry
