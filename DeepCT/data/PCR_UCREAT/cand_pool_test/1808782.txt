Section requires every person or body desirous of obtaining permission to make an application in the manner prescribed Section provides for an appeal to the Chairman against an order made by the Vice Chairman refusing permission Section inter alia makes an order of the Vice Chairman made under final Section makes it incumbent on the <ORG> the Chairman or the Vice Chairman to carry out such directions as may be issued to it from time to time by <ORG> for the efficient administration of the Act Section confers revisional powers on <ORG> To that letter was annexed a notice for service on the lessees and the builder associated with construction to show cause for cancellation of the lease and demolition of unau thorised construction This order was challenged by the respondent lessees in a writ petition before <ORG> <ORG> found that the proceedings initiated and the action taken by the <ORG> and the Vice Chairman of the <ORG> in the matter respectively of forfeiture of the lease and the cancellation of the permission to build were both infirm in law and required to he quashed It took the view that a reasonable opportunity of being heard had been denied to the lessee respondents and that the grounds for forfeiture of the lease were irrelevant and illusory that there was no provision in the Development Act confer ring powers on the ViceChairman to review the decision in the matter of sanctioning a plan to build after the same was acted upon and constructions were being made only in accord ance with it that of the Act could authorise the Vice Chairman to review the earlier permission but that there being no such directive from the <ORG> the Vice Chairman acting as a statutory authority had no power to revoke or cancel the permission once granted and that there was no casual con nection between the <ORG> directive dated October IS which had confined itself to the cancellation of the lease and the proceedings initiated by the Vice Chairman on January In the appeals by special leave preferred by <ORG> in the matter of forfeiture of lease it was contended for the appellants that <ORG> fell into an error in allowing a matter which should properly have been the subject matter of a civil suit to be agitated in proceedings under Article of the Constitution The submission was that the question whether there were breaches of covenants on the part of the lessees involved the con struction of the terms of the lease deed which required evidence on the matter and such a dispute could not be resolved on mere affidavits and that the relationship between the parties being one of lessor and lessee the dispute between them pertained to a private law situation In the appeals by special leave by <ORG> in the matter or cancellation of permission to build it was contended for it that the order dated April itself disclosed the extent or opportunities af forded to the lessees and there could therefore be no question of failure or natural justice that if permission had been obtained by the lessees by misrepresentation or fraud or if after obtaining the permission there had been violation of the terms and conditions or the grant as in the instant case the statutory authority granting the permission has itself the inherent and incidental and sup plemental powers to revoke the permission and that no express grant of power in this behalf was necessary For the respondents it was contended that the proceedings for can cellation of the permission having been initiated at the instance of and compelled by the directions issued by the <ORG> purporting to act under of the Act there was a surrender of statutory discretion on the part of the Vice Chairman thereby vitiating the decision that the Vice Chairman had no authority in law to cancel the permis sion that the power to cancel or revoke a licence or per mission even assuming that the statute enables such can cellation was clearly distinguishable from the power of refusal of an initial grant and that the exercise of power of cancellation which prejudicially affects vested fights partakes predominantly of quasi judicial complexion and that as there was denial of a reasonable opportunity of being heard the order passed by the Vice Chairman violates the principles of natural justice The question of the legality and validity of the purported cancella tion of the lease and the defence of the lessees is left open to be urged in appropriate legal proceedings whenever and wherever <ORG> proceeds to initiate action in accordance with law for resumption of possession Partly allowing the appeals by <ORG> HELD The Vice Chairman for purposes of of the Act is a distinct statutory authority with statutory powers of his own distinct from Development <ORG> which under is a body corporate having perpetual succes sion and common seal An order made by him under of the Act granting permission is not one of the orders revisable by <ORG> under The power to grant where the grant is itself vitiated by fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the grantee at the time of obtaining the grant or where the grantee after the grant violates the essential terms and conditions subject to which grant is made must therefore be held to include the power to revoke or cancel the permit even in the absence of any other express statutory provisions in that behalf In exercising the power the authority must bring to bear an unbiased mind consider impartially the objections raised by the aggrieved party and decide the matter consist ent with the principles of natural justice In the instant case however there was no such surren der of discretion by the <ORG> When the issue raised in judicial review is whether a decision is vitiated by taking into account irrelevant or neglecting to take into account of relevant factors or is so manifestly unreasonable that no reasonable authority entrusted with the power in question could reasonably have made such a decision the judicial review of the decision making process includes examination as a matter of law of the relevance of the factors It is left open to the statutory authority should it consider it necessary to issue a fresh show cause notice setting out the precise grounds and afford a reasonable opportunity including an opportunity of personal hearing and of adducing evidence wherever necessary to the respond ent lessees From the Judgment and Order dated of <ORG> in Nos of and of From the Judgment and Order dated of <ORG> in Nos of and of Seeking special leave to appeal from the common judgment dated of <ORG> Allahabad in Writ Petition Nos of and of which were heard and decided along with three other writ petitions i WP of and of Special leave petitions of and SLP of are by the <ORG> and its <ORG> directed against the said common judgment dated in so far as it per tains respectively to of and of The second area of the controversy arises out of the order dated of the Vice Chairman <ORG> <ORG> for short cancelling the earlier order dated granting permission under Sec They relate to certain incidental matters The lessees preferred an appeal before <ORG> who dismissed their appeal affidavit dated before the appropriate authority of the <ORG> in regard to their being no impediment under Urban Ceiling Laws and the manner in which the Lessees propose to comply with any order that may eventually be made in that behalf with the <ORG> towards what was called Malba charges In of Respondent Lessees challenged this direction of the <ORG> before <ORG> which allowed the petition and quashed those direc tions It has come to the notice of the <ORG> If the desired explanation is not received within three days of the service of this notice by the undersigned it will be presumed that they have nothing to say in their defence and thereafter action for can cellation of nazul lease and building permit and the removal of the unauthorised construc tions will be taken along with their prosecu tion for fraudulent statement and misrepresen tation as contained in the affidavit The respondents filed their objections and represen tations against the proposed cancellation <ORG> was persuaded to the view that the proceedings initiated and the action taken by the <ORG> and the Vice Chairman of the <ORG> in the matter respective ly of forfeiture of the lease and the cancellation of the permission to build were both infirm in law and required to be quashed Learned counsel submitted that the relationship between the parties was one of the Lessor and <ORG> the dispute between them pertained to the question whether there were breaches and non performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease justifying the forfei ture of the lease and that these matters pertained to a private law situation and were not appropriately matters for enforcement of public law remedies Learned Counsel further submitted that the question whether there were breaches of covenants on the part of the lessee involved the construc tion of the terms of the lease deed and required evidence on the matter Thirdly <NAME> submitted that on the merits of the conten tions <ORG> should have noticed that even on the facts admitted there were clear violations of the covenants and conditions of the lease Learned counsel submitted that even according to the learned judges there were serious questions to be examined At the same time a person who has acquired rights in such property cannot also be deprived of them except in accordance with law In <NAME> <ORG> of Punjab SCR this Court said We must therefore repel the argument based on the contention that the petitioners were trespassers and could be removed by an executive order Before we part with this case we feel it our duty to say that the executive action taken in this case by the <ORG> and its officers is destructive of the basic principle of the rule of law Therefore there is no question in the present case of the Government thinking of appropriating to itself an extra judicial right of re entry In the result the appeals of the State of Utter Pradesh SLPs and of and of the LDA SLPs and of directed against the common Judgment dated in so far as it pertains to WP of and WP of are allowed and the said two writ petitions are dismissed leaving the question of the legality and validity of the purported cancellation of the lease and the defence of the lessees open to be urged in appropriate legal pro ceedings whenever and wherever Government proceeds to initiate action in accordance with law for resumption of possession on the basis of the alleged cancellation or forfeiture of the lease The order dated revoking the permission was challenged before <ORG> on four grounds viz a that the lessees had had no reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed in the notice dated and that an opportunity of an oral hearing had been denied that the Vice Chairman under the provi sions of the Act had no authority or power to revoke a permission once granted that at all events the les sees having incurred enormous expenditure on the development work and having on the strength of the permission granted earlier on altered their position substantially to their disadvantage the Vice Chairman was estopped from revoking the permission on principles of promissory estop pel and that the grounds on which cancellation rested were themselves irrelevant and insufficient in law to sup port the cancellation In regard to the <NAME> grievance at a supra of denial of natural justice <ORG> said He even did not give any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner on the said question and passed an order some months thereaf ter without even touching the objection of the petitioner regarding the competence and juris diction of the Vice Chairman Some new facts which found place in para of the show cause notice also found place in the order As hearing has not been given to the petition er although there was enough time for the same the order passed by the ViceChairman violates the principles of natural justice and cannot be sustained There is no other provision in the Development Act conferring powers on the Vice Chairman to review the decision in the matter of sanctioning a plan to build Learned counsel urged that the order dated itself discloses the extent of the opportunities afforded to the Lessees and there could therefore be no question of failure of natural As to the Vice Chairman power to cancel or to revoke a permission earlier granted Sri <NAME> submitted that if the permission had been obtained by the lessees by misrepresentation or fraud or if after obtaining the permission there had been violation of the terms and conditions of the grant the statutory authority granting the permission has itself the inherent and incidental and supplemental powers to revoke the permission and that no express grant of power in this behalf was necessary He further submitted that there was material on record to show that the officers and the authorities of the <ORG> concerned with the grant of the permission under section had betrayed the trust reposed in them by the statute and were disloyal to <ORG> and on that ground also the successor Vice Chairman could revoke and rescind the sanction so vitiated by fraud <NAME> for the <NAME> however maintained that the Vice Chairman having regard to the nature of the allegations on which the revocation is purported and which fell in the last category mentioned by Sri <NAME> had no authority in law to cancel the permission revoke a licence or permission even assuming that the Statute enabled such cancellation was clearly distinguisha ble from a power of refusal of an initial grant and that the exercise of the power of cancellation which prejudically affects vested rights partake predominently of quasi judi cial complexion and where as here such power is resorted to at the behest of some body extraneous to the power there would be an abdication and surrender of the statutory dis cretion vitiating the decision Sri <NAME> said that the ViceChairman even granting that he had power to cancel acted at the behest of the <ORG> which purported to Act under Section issued directives on and on overriding the discretion of the Vice Chairman As <ORG> was of the view that the urban development and planning work in the State had already been delayed it was felt necessary to provide for early estab lishment of such Authorities Section provides Application for permission Every person or body other than any department of Government or any local authority desiring to obtain the permission referred to in Section shah make an application in writing to the ViceChairman in such form and containing such particulars in respect of the development to which the application relates as may be prescribed by bye laws The Vice Chairman for purposes of Section is a distinct statutory authority with statutory powers of his own dis tinct from <ORG> which under section is a body corporate having perpetual succession and common seal Section inter alia makes an order of the Vice Chairman made under Sec Section enables <ORG> either on its own motion or on an application made to it in this behalf to call for the records of any case disposed of or order passed by the <ORG> or the Chairman for purposes of satisfying itself as to its legality or propriety and may pass such orders or issue such directions in relation there to as it may think fit of the Act provides Control by State Government The Authority the Chairman or the Vice Chairman shah carry out such directions as may be issued to it from time to time by <ORG> for the efficient administration of this Act <NAME> for the <NAME> says that the proceedings for cancellation were initiated at the instance of and compelled by the directives issued by <ORG> under Section and that therefore there was a surrender of discretion by the statutory <ORG> viz <ORG> says that section could authorise the Vice Chairman to review the earlier permission but that there being no such direc tive the Vice Chairman had no power to review There was no provision in the Act expressly conferring the power to make a provision for cancellation of the permit Section of the parent Act merely enabled the government to make orders for Regulating by licences permits or otherwise the storage transport distribution disposal acquisition use or consumption of any essential commodity and Section merely enabled Government to make orders for incidental and supplementary matters empha sis supplied It was held If a trade in an essential commodi ty like coal is to be regulated by licenses or permits it is obvious that the power to grant licenses or permits must include the power to cancel or suspend such licenses or permits as an incidental or supplementary matter otherwise the very purpose of of the Act would be frustrated Indeed the submissions of Sri <NAME> on the point contemplate the exercise of the power to cancel or revoke the permission in three distinct situations In these two areas the power to grant must be held to include the power to revoke or cancel the permit even in the ab sence of any other express statutory provisions in that behalf It is true that in exercise of powers of revoking or cancelling the permission is akin to and partakes of a quasi judicial complexion and that in exercising of the former power the authority must bring to bear an unbiased mind consider impartially the objections raised by the aggrieved party and decide the matter consistent with the principles of natural justice It must act in good faith must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be swayed by irrelevant considerations must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously This infact was the basis for holding that the Vice Chairman had no power to cancel There is no material to hold that <NAME> felt himself bound by that directive Lord Hail sham said The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the authority after according fair treatment reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to decide for itself a conclusion which is correct in the eyes of the court When the issue raised in judicial review is whether a decision is vitiated by taking into account irrelevant or neglecting to take into account of relevant factors or is so manifestly unreasonable that no reasonable authority entrusted with the power in question could reasonably have made such a decision the judicial review of the decision making process includes examination as a matter of law of the relevance of the factors In the present case it is however not necessary to go into the merits and relevance of the grounds having regard to the view we propose to take on the point on natural justice It would however be appropriate for the statutory authori ty if it proposes to initiate action afresh to classify the grounds pointing out which grounds in its opinion support the allegation of fraud or misre presentation and which in its view constitute subsequent violations of the terms and conditions of the grant The grounds must be specific so as to afford the <NAME> an effective opportunity of showing cause On the point of denial of natural justice we agree with conclusion of <ORG> though not for the same reasons that there has been such a denial in the proceed ings culminating in the order of cancellation We therefore agree with the conclusion of <ORG> that both the show cause notice dated and the subsequent order dated would require to be quashed however leaving it open to the statutory authori ty should it consider it necessary to issue a fresh show cause notice setting out the precise grounds and afford a reasonable opportunity including an opportunity of personal heating and of adducing evidence wherever necessary to the Respondent <NAME> In view of this liberty reserved to the authority it is necessary to setaside the findings recorded by <ORG> on the merits of the grounds The appeal of <ORG> arising out of SLP of is partly allowed and the order of <ORG> in WP modified accordingly Appeals arising out of SLPs of and of of the LDA directed against the common judgment of <ORG> in so far as it relates to WP of and WP of also disposed of in the light of the order is made in the appeals arising out of SLPs and of
