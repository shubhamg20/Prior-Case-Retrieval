The truck was insured with <ORG> New Delhi and under the policy there was a special clause that the insurance company would be liable to compensate not only under the Workmen Compensation Act but also under the Fatal Accidents Act or at common law in respect of any personal injury to any paid driver or cleaner or conductor or a person employed in loading and or unloading The application was contested by all the respondents except <NAME> driver who did not appear and was proceeded ex parte The <ORG> held under issue No on the basis of certain decisions which have been noticed that it had the jurisdiction and this point has not been raised before me in appeal As regards issues Nos and which were dealt with together it was held that the case was not covered by Section of the Motor Vehicles Act with the result that the Workmen Compensation Act was not applicable and therefore the liability of the insurance company was not limited to the amount which could be awarded under the Workmen Compensation Act Before me Mr <NAME> wanted to raise his first submission which was also raised before the Tribunal that since the deceased was a conductor on the truck the case fell under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act and the compensation which had to be awarded to the claimants had to be calculated in the manner given in the Workmen Compensation Act I think Mr <NAME> counsel for the claimants is right in saying that the aforesaid point raised by Mr <NAME> need not be gone into in view of the special provision in the policy on the basis of which the claimants would be entitled to claim compensation at common law That case has nothing to do with the present case as there is a specific provision in the policy for grant of compensation to the conductor and other employees of the insured truck under the common law As such this case does not militate against the view taken by the Madras and Gujarat <ORG> with which I fully agree Accordingly I hold that in view of the special provisions the claimants were entitled to the compensation under common law and they could be awarded compensation beyond the amount fixed in the Schedule to the Workmen Compensation Act For the reasons recorded above I find no merit in the appeal filed by the insurance company and dismiss the same
