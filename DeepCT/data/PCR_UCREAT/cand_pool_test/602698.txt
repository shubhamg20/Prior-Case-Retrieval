It is found as a fact by the lower <ORG> that there was a definite agreement as to the terms of this compromise and that the parties decided that it would be best to have this compromise embodied in the award of an arbitrator on a reference by the <ORG> While that suit was pending the present suit was filed wherein the plaintiff seeks possession of properties allotted to them by the decision of the arbitrator or in the alternative a declaration that they have a reversionary right therein There are two questions now before me in this second appeal I will deal first with the purely legal question as to the possibility of making an abortive reference to arbitration through <ORG> the foundation of a separate suit as on a private agreement where it was held that when there was a reference to arbitration through <ORG> and a separate agreement by the parties that the arbitrators should deal with matters not within the scope of the suit though the award is invalid under para With reverence to that ruling it must be observed that in the present case there is really no agreement subsequent to the agreement to refer matters to arbitration The essence of the agreement is that both the plaintiffs and the defendant were anxious to determine the litigation without further expense and on that consideration they agreed that the arbitrator on reference through <ORG> should decide the question of the rights of parties including the rights to possession and pecuniary compensation It has been argued that the authority of this case is taken by a <ORG> decision <NAME> <NAME> Mad wherein it is held that Section Civil is not a bar to a decree in terms of an award based on an extra judicial reference to arbitration being passed in a pending suit referred to above there is a separate private agreement for the decision of additional questions by the arbitrator In this view I must hold that the view taken by the <ORG>s below that the reference to arbitration was vitiated by illegality at its inception and that the award based solely on such an illegal reference cannot be enforced by a suit is correct The plea of defendant expressly was that there was a conspiracy between the arbitrator and the village officers to pass an award different from that which the parties themselves had agreed upon at the time when this more or less formal application for reference to arbitration was made in <ORG>
