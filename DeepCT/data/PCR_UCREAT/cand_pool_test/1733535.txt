HEADNOTE Rule of the Defence of India Rules provided that a State Government might if it was satisfied with respect to a person that with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial inter alia to public safety and maintenance of public order it is necessary to do so order him to be detained The order stated that the District Magistrate was satisfied that with a view to prevent the petitioner from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of law and order it was necessary to detain him of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus directing his release from detention contending that i though an order of detention to prevent acts prejudicial to public order may be justifiable an order to prevent acts prejudicial to law and order would not be justified by the rule ii the order mentioned a notification which did not contain the necessary delegation iii the District Magis trate acted beyond his jurisdiction by considering the danger not only in his district but in the entire State and iv all the conditions mentioned in the rule must be cumulatively applied before the order of detention could be made that the right of a person to move any court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Arts was in force if such person had been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Act or any rule made thereunder and that therefore this <ORG> was prevented from entertaining the petition Where a person was detained in violation of the mandatory provisions of the Defence of India Act his right to move the <ORG> was not suspended Per <NAME> Before an entry into the portals of this <ORG> could be denied to a detenu he must be shown an order under of the Defence of India Rules made by a competent authority stating that it was satisfied that the detenu was likely to indulge in activities which would be prejudicial to one or more of the matters referred to in the rule Upon an examination of the order if the <ORG> finds that it was not competently made or was ambiguous it must exercise its power under Art terms of the rule unless it could be said that the expression law and order means the same thing as Public order <ORG>s are only entitled to look at the face of the order because the satisfaction which justifies the order under the rule is the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority The order is conclusive as to the state of the mind of the person who made it and no evidence is admissible to prove that state of mind But the order has notwithstanding this to be held illegal though it mentioned a ground on which a legal order of detention could have been based because it could not be said in what manner and to what extent the valid and invalid grounds operated an the mind of the authority concerned and contributed to the creation of subjective satisfaction The satisfaction of the detaining authority cannot be subjected to objective tests and courts are not to exercise appellate powers over such authorities and an order proper on its face passed by a competent authority in good faith would be a complete answer to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus But when from the order itself circumstances appear which raise a doubt whether the officer concerned had not misconceived his own powers there is need to pause and enquire The contravention of law always affects order but before it can be said to affect public order it must affect the community or the public at large One has to imagine three concentric circles the largest representing law and order the next representing public order and the smallest representing security of State An act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but not security of the State The expression law and order does not find any place in the rule and is not synonymous with public order A Per <NAME> dissenting The District Magistrate made the impugned order on his being satisfied that it was necessary to do so with a view to prevent the petitioner from acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order There is no room for considering that be might not have passed the order merely with one object in view the object being to prevent him from acting prejudicially to public safety To admit such evidence would not be going behind the face of the order because what is necessary to appear on the face of the order is the satisfaction of the <ORG> of the necessity for detention for any of the reasons mentioned in and not his authority to make the order There was only a clerical error in mentioning the wrong notification and being a venial fault did not vitiate the order of detention There was nothing wrong in the District Magistrate taking a broad view of the petitioner activities so as to weigh the possible harm if he was not detained I do not propose to deal with all these grounds for I have come to the conclusion that he is entitled to be released on one of them and to the discussion of that ground alone I will confine my judgment The order of detention runs thus Whereas <NAME> District Magistrate Patna am satisfied that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of law and order it is necessary to make an order that he be detained Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by clause of sub rule of rule of the Defence of India Rules read with Notification No COW I hereby direct that Dr <NAME> be arrested and detained in the Contra Jail Hazaribagh until further orders It is admitted that the rule provides for an order of detention being made to prevent act prejudicial to the maintenance of public order but it is said that public order and law and order are not the same thing and therefore though an order of detention to prevent acts prejudicial to public order might be justifiable a similar order to prevent acts prejudicial to law and order would not be justified by the rule Before proceeding to state my reasons for this view I have to dispose of an argument in bar advanced by the respondent <ORG> That argument is that the petitioner has in view of a certain order of the President to which I will presently refer no right to move the <ORG> under Art Article of the Constitution gives the President of India a power to declare by Proclamation that a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India is threatened inter alia by external aggression This presumably was done in view of China attack on the north eastern frontiers of India in September which he was entitled to do declaring that the right of any person to move any court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by article and article of the Constitution shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force if such person has been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder It deprives a person of his right to move a court for the enforcement of a right to such personal liberty only when he has been deprived of it by the Defence of India Act it is not necessary to refer to the Ordinance any more as it has been replaced by the Act or any rule or order made thereunder If he has not been so deprived the Order does not take away his right to move a court Thus if a person is detained under the Preventive Detention Act his right to move the <ORG> for enforcement of his rights under Arts If any person says as Dr <NAME> does that he has been deprived of his personal liberty by an order not made under the Act or the Rules there is nothing in the President Order under Art to deprive him of his right to move the <ORG> under Art is one of the fundamental rights that the Constitution has guaranteed to all persons and it cannot be taken away except by the methods as provided in the Constitution one of which is by an order made under Art That case is of no assistance in deciding the question in what circumstance a right to move the court has been taken away by the entirely different provisions that we have to consider Here only a right to move a court in certain circumstances has been taken away and the question is has the court been moved on the present occasion in one of those circumstances The President Order does not bar an enquiry into that question I here pause to observe that if it was not so made there is no other justification for his detention none is indeed advanced Section of the Act gave <ORG> power to make rules providing for the detention of persons without trial for various reasons there mentioned Rule under which the order of detention of Dr <NAME> was made was framed under and is in these terms The Central Government or <ORG> if it is satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India and civil defence the public safety the maintenance of public order India relations with foreign powers the maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part of India the efficient conduct of military operations or the maintenance of supplier and services essential to the life of the community it is necessary to do so may make an order a The detention order in this case is based on the ground that it was necessary to make it to prevent Dr <NAME> from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety and the maintenance of law and order I will in discussing the contention of Dr <NAME> proceed on the basis as if the order directing detention was only for preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order The order therefore would not be in terms of the rule unless it could be said that the expression law and order means the same thing as public order which occurs in the rule Could that then be said I find no reason to think so It is commonplace that words in a statutory provision take their meaning from the context in which they are used The satisfaction of the <ORG> which justifies the order under the rule is a subjective satisfaction it seems to me that when an order is on the face of it not in terms of the rule a court cannot equally enter into an investigation whether the order of detention was in fact that is to say irrespective of what is stated in it in terms of the rule In other words in such a case the <ORG> cannot be heard to say or prove that the order was in fact made for example to prevent acts prejudicial to public order which would bring it within the rule though the order does not say so We are dealing with a statute which drastically interferes with the personal liberty of people we are dealing with an order behind the face of which a court is prevented from going It turned on a statutory Regulation empowering a specified authority to take possession of land for the purposes mentioned in it in various terms but which term did not include the expression national interest This contention failed as it was held that the giving of the notice was not a prerequisite to the exercise of the powers under the Regulation and that the notice was no more than a notification that the authorities were exercising the powers Under a person can be detained only by an order and there is no doubt that the order of detention has to be in writing The order further is conclusive as to the state of the mind of the person who made it no evidence is admissible to prove that state of mind It seems to me that if the <NAME> case was concerned with an order which alone resulted in the dispossession the decision in that case might well have been otherwise It was under <ORG> No II CW that the power of <ORG> to make an order of detention was delegated to the District Magistrate under the provisions of of the Act to which I have earlier referred The result was that the order did not show on its face that the District Magistrate who had made it had the necessary authority to do so Nothing in the rules requires that an order of detention should state that the authority making it has the power to do so It may be that an order made by an authority to whom the Government power has not been delegated is a nullity and the order can be challenged on that ground When the power of the person making the order is challenged the only fact to be proved is that the power to make the order had been duly delegated to him The second thing to which I wish to refer is that it appeared from the affidavit sworn by the District Magistrate that prior to the making of the order he had recorded a note which <NAME> in these words Perused the report of the Senior Patna for detention of Dr Ram Manohar <NAME> under rule of the Defence of India Rules on the ground that his being at The satisfaction of the Superintendent of Police would provide no warrant for the detention or the order with it we have nothing to do Without more we have to accept an order made on that ground as a perfectly legal order As it will be necessary to refer to the terms of the order served on him it is reproduced here ORDER No Dated Patna the th August Whereas <NAME> District Magistrate Patna am satisfied with respect to the person known as Dr Ram Manohar <NAME> <ORG> Patna that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of law and order it is necessary to make an order that he be detained Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by clause of sub clause i of rule of the Defence of India Rules read with Notification No CW dated the th March of <ORG> <ORG> I hereby direct that the said Dr <NAME> be arrested by the police wherever found and detained in the Central Jail Hazaribagh until further orders He sent a letter in Hindi together with an affidavit sworn in the jail to the Chief Justice which was received on August in <ORG> Although the petition was somewhat irregular this <ORG> issued a rule and as no objection has been taken on the ground of form we say nothing more about it He further stated that the order of detention showed that he was to be detained in Bankipur Jail but the name of the Jail was scored out and Central Jail Hazaribagh was substituted which led him to conclude that typed orders of detention were kept ready and that the District Magistrate did not exercise his mind in each individual case In answer to Dr <NAME> affidavit two affidavits were filed on behalf of the respondents He said that the report of the Senior Superintendent of Police Patna contained facts which he considered sufficient for taking the said action but he could not disclose the contents of that report in the public interest He stated further that as the disturbance was on a very large scale it was thought expedient to keep ready typed copies of detention orders and to make necessary alterations in them to suit individual cases at the time of the actual issuance of the orders and that it was because of this that the words Central Jail Hazaribagh were substituted for Bankipur Jail As we shall refer to that order later it is reproduced here He admitted however that he had told him that cases of arson and toot had taken place He affirmed that there was no charge of arson against Dr <NAME> He characterised the counter affidavits as full of lies and narrated other facts intending to show that there was a conspiracy to seal his mouth so that disclosures against <ORG> might not be made On merits it is contended on behalf of the <ORG> of Bihar that the petition if not barred does not make out a case against the legality of the detention that this <ORG> cannot consider the question of good faith and that the only enquiry open to this <ORG> is whether there is or is not an order under Rule of the Defence of India Rules If this <ORG> finds that there is such an order the enquiry is closed because the petition must then be considered as incompetent Questions about the right of persons detained under the Defence of India Rules to move the <ORG> have come up frequently before this <ORG> and many of the arguments which are raised here have already been considered in a series of cases It is there pointed out that although the right of the detenu to move the <ORG> is taken away that can only be in cases in which the proper detaining authority passes a valid order of detention and the order is made bona fide for the purpose which it professes It would therefore appear from the latter case that there is an area of enquiry open before a court will declare that the detenu has lost his right to move the court That area at least embraces an enquiry into whether there is action by a competent authority and in accordance with Defence of India Act and the Rules thereunder Mr <NAME> appearing for the State of Bihar however contends that the area of the enquiry cannot embrace anything more than finding out whether there is an order of detention or not and the moment such an order good on its face is produced all enquiry into good faith sufficiency of the reasons or the legality or illegality of the action comes to an end for to go into such matters is tantamount to allowing the petitioner to move the court which the President Order does not permit permitted the suspension of the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part Suspension of the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III during emergencies Where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation the President may by order declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order Every order made under clause shall as soon as may be after it is made be laid before <ORG> In exercise of the powers conferred by clause of article of the Constitution the President hereby declares that the right of any person to move any court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by article and article of the Constitution shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation of Emergency issued under clause of article thereof on the th October is in force if such person has been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder As a result of the above Order the right of any person to move any court for the rights conferred by Arts and of the Constitution remains suspended if such person is deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Ordinance now the Defence of India Act or any rule or order made thereunder No doubt as the article under which the President Order was passed and also that Order say the right to move the court is taken away but that is in respect of a right conferred on any person by Arts and and provided such person is deprived of the right under the Defence of India Ordinance now the Act or any rule or order made thereunder Article lays down that no person is to be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law This article thinks in terms of the ordinary laws which govern our society when there is no declaration of emergency and which are enacted subject to the provisions of the Constitution including the Chapter on Fundamental Rights but other than those made under the powers conferred by the Emergency Provisions in Part XVIII he took away from any person dealt with under the terms of his Order the right to plead in a court of law that he was being deprived of his life and personal liberty otherwise than according to the procedure established by the laws of the country In other words he could not invoke the procedure established by ordinary law But to be able to say that the right to move the court for the enforcement of rights under Art is suspended it is necessary to establish that such person has been deprived of any such right under the Defence of India Act or any rule or order made thereunder that is to say under the authority of the Act The scrutiny with reference to procedure established by laws other than the Defence of India Act is of course shut out but an enquiry whether the action is justified under the Defence of India Act itself is not shut out Just as action is limited in its extent by the power conferred so also the power to move the court is curtailed only when there is strict compliance with the Defence of India Act and the Rules That part of the enquiry and consequently the right of a person to move the court to have that enquiry made is not affected By cl the first two clauses do not apply to an alien enemy or to a person arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention Clauses and provide for the procedure for dealing with persons arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention and lay down the minimum or compulsory requirements would have applied to arrest and detentions under the Defence of India Act also if the President Order had not taken away from such a person the right to move any court to enforce the protection of Art read with the President Order there is no difference between a petition under that article and a petition under Art There is however another aspect which needs to be mentioned here Mr <NAME> however contends on the authority of <NAME> East Elloe Rural District <NAME> Others that the validity of the orders under the Defence of India Rules cannot be challenged on the ground of bad faith when the action is otherwise proper the statutory power acts from some improper or ulterior motive he acts in bad faith The misuse may arise from a breach of the law conferring the power or from an abuse of the power in bad faith We now proceed to examine the contentions of Dr <NAME> by which he claims to be entitled to have the order of the District Magistrate set aside Dr <NAME> alleges that there was a conspiracy between <ORG> the State of Bihar the Senior Superintendent of Police and the District Magistrate Patna to stifle his disclosures against <ORG> the Chief Minister and others He says that he was about to leave Patna and if the train was not late he would have gone away and he hints that his detention was made to prevent him from taking part in the Session of Parliament The District Magistrate has given the background of events in which he made the order on his responsibility There is no dispute that the District Magistrate was duly authorized to act under Rule of the Defence of India Rules We shall now consider these grounds of objection WHEREAS the President has declared by Proclamation under clause of article of the Constitution that a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India is threatened by external aggression AND WHEREAS it is necessary to provide for special measures to ensure the public safety and interest the defence of India and civil defence and for the trial of certain offences and for matters connected therewith We may next read section which confers power to make rules Power to make rules <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make such rules as appear to it necessary or expedient for securing the defence of India and civil defence the public safety the maintenance of public order or the efficient conduct of military operations or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community Then by way of illustration and without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub certain specific things are mentioned for which provision may be made by rules Clause provides Notwithstanding anything in any other law for the time being in force i the apprehension and detention in custody of any person whom the authority empowered by the rules to apprehend or detain the authority empowered to detain not being lower in rank than that of a District Magistrate suspects on grounds appearing to that authority to be reasonable of being of hostile origin or of having acted acting being about to act or being likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the defence of India and civil defence the security of the State the public safety or interest the maintenance of public order India relations with foreign States the maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part or area of India or the efficient conduct of military operations or with respect to whom that authority is satisfied that his apprehension and detention are necessary for the purpose of preventing him from acting in any such prejudicial manner ii the prohibition of such person from entering or residing or remaining in any area iii the compelling of such person to reside and remain in any area or to do or abstain from doing anything and iv the review of orders of detention passed in pursuance of any rule made under sub clause We need not trouble ourselves with the other clauses These rules provide for various subjects such as Entering enemy territory Rule Entering India Rule Information to be supplied by persons entering India Rule or Leaving India Rule Regulation of Movement of Persons within India Rule Powers of photographing etc <ORG> or <ORG> if it is satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India and civil defence the public safety the maintenance of public order India relations with foreign powers the maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part of India the efficient conduct of military operations or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community it is necessary so to do may make an order a directing that he be detained Under of the Defence of India Act <ORG> may by order direct that the powers conferred by the Rules may be exercised by any officer or authority in such circumstances and under such conditions as may be specified in the direction He contends also that the notifications are bad because although the Defence of India Act contemplates the imposition of conditions none were imposed and no circumstances for the exercise of power were specified There was nothing wrong if the District Magistrate took a broad view of his activities so as to weigh the possible harm if he was not detained There was a clerical error in mentioning the notification and the error did not vitiate the order of detention This brings us to the last contention of Dr <NAME> and that is the most serious of all He points out that the District Magistrate purports to detain him with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of law and order and argues that the District Magistrate had misunderstood his own powers which were to prevent acts prejudicial to public order and therefore the detention is illegal Much debate took place on the meaning of the two expressions In conferring power to make rules of the Defence of India Act enlarges upon the terms of the preamble by specification of details Then it mentions by way of illustration in cl of the same section the power of apprehension and detention in custody of any person whom the authority empowered by the rules to apprehend or detain the authority empowered to detain not being lower in rank than that of a District Magistrate suspects on grounds appearing to that authority to be reasonable a of being of hostile origin or of having acted acting or being about to act or being likely to act in a manner prejudicial to i the defence of India and civil defence ii the security of the <ORG> iii the public safety or interest iv the maintenance of public order India relations with foreign states vi the maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part or area of India or vii the efficient conduct of military operations It will thus appear that security of the state public safety or interest maintenance of public order and the maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part or area of India may be viewed separately even though strictly one clause may have an effect or bearing on another Then follows rule which repeats the above conditions and per mits detention of any person with a view to preventing him from acting in any of the above ways It may be taken as settled that the satisfaction of the detaining authority cannot be subjected to objective tests that the courts are not to exercise appellate powers over such authorities and that an order proper on its face passed by a competent authority in good faith is a complete answer to a petition such as this In India courts are ordinarily satisfied on the production of a proper order of detention made in good faith by an authority duly authorised and have not enquired further even though the power is exercised by thousands of officers subordinate to the <ORG> and <ORG> Governments as their delegates When from the order itself circumstances appear which raise a doubt whether the officer concerned had not misconceived his own powers there is need to pause and enquire There are only two possibilities i that there was a slip in preparing the order or ii that maintenance of law and order was in the mind of the District Magistrate and he thought it meant the same thing as maintenance of public order It is therefore necessary to examine critically the order which mentioned law and order with a view to ascertaining whether the District Magistrate did not act outside his powers He contends that there is no magic in using the formula of the Act and Rules for the language of the Act and the Rules can be quoted mechanically The Regulation read A competent authority if it appears to that authority to be necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of the public safety the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community may take possession of any land and may give such directions as appear to the competent authority to be necessary or expedient in connection with the taking of possession of that land There was an order against <ORG> by the Commissioner of Works requisitioning the factory The order read I have to inform you that the department have come to the conclusion that it is essential in the national interest to take possession of the above premises occupied by you Lord <NAME> speaking on behalf of Lord <NAME> then Lord Justice and Lord du Parcq then Lord Justice observed It was said that it was the duty of the person acting in the capacity of a competent authority to examine the facts of the case and consider under which if any of those various heads the matter came and it is said that the assistant secretary did nothing of the kind He took the view that it was required either for all those purposes or at any rate for some of them and I must confess it seems to me that it would have been a waste of time on the facts of this case for anyone seriously to sit down and ask himself under which particular head the case fell It seems to me therefore that there is no substance in that point and his evidence makes it quite clear that he did bring his mind to bear on the question whether it appeared to him to be necessary or expedient to requisition this property for the purposes named or some of them We shall refer to some of these observations before we discuss the two phrases in the context of the Defence of India Rules lm Public order but not including the use of His Majesty naval military or air forces in aid of the civil power observed that public Order with which that item began was a most comprehensive term Public order is an expression of wide connotation and signifies that state of tranquillity which prevails among the members of a political society as a result of internal regulations enforced by the Government which they have established it must be taken that public safety is used as a part of the wider concept of public order and referring to Entry in List III Concurrent List of the th Schedule of the Constitution which includes the security of a <ORG> and maintenance of public order as distinct topics of legislation observed in the field of public order or tranquillity marking off may be roughly the boundary between those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> and the relatively minor breaches of the peace of a purely local significance treating for this purpose differences in degree as if they were differences in kind We have here a case of detention under Rule of the Defence of India Rules which permits apprehension and detention of a person likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order The contravention of law always affects order but before it can be said to affect public order it must affect the community or the public at large It will thus appear that just as public order in the rulings of this <ORG> earlier cited was said to comprehend disorders of less gravity than those affecting security of <ORG> law and order also comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting public order One has to imagine three concentric circles Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of <ORG> It is then easy to see that an act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but not security of the <ORG> There is nothing to show that one purpose was considered to be more essential than the other If there is allegation of bad faith they can be seen to determine the question of good faith But if action is taken to maintain law and order instead of maintaining public order there is room to think that the powers were misconceived and if there is such a fundamental error then the action remains vulnerable This order is as follows Whereas <NAME> District Magistrate Patna am satisfied with respect to the person known as Dr <NAME> <ORG> Patna that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of law and order it is necessary to make an order that he be detained Now therefore in the exercise of the powers conferred by clause of sub rule of rule of the Defence of India Rules read with Notification No CW dated the th March of the Govt and of the Constitution in view of the Order of the President dated November in the exercise of powers conferred on him by cl of art I agree with the views expressed by <NAME> about all the contentions except one That contention is that the appropriate authority is not empowered to order detention with a view to prevent a person from acting in any way prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order It is urged that though the District Magistrate could order the detention of the petitioner with a view to prevent him from acting in any way prejudical to the public safety and the maintenance of public order he could not order detention with a view to prevent the petitioner from acting prejudicially to the public safety and maintenance of law and order as the latter object being not synonymous with the object of preventing him from acting prejudicial to public order is outside the purview of the provisions of of the rules and that therefore the entire order is bad Under the District Magistrate could have made the order of detention with respect to Dr <NAME> if he was satisfied that he be detained with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public order The <ORG> can however investigate whether he exercised the power under honestly and bona fide or not i whether he ordered detention on being satisfied as required by We have therefore to examine whether the District Magistrate was really satisfied about the necessity to detain Dr <NAME> with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order There is no reason to disbelieve his statement The District Magistrate omission to repeat in the second sentence where he speaks of his satisfaction that Dr <NAME> be detained with a view to preventing him from acting prejudicially to the public safety and maintenance of public order does not mean that he was not so satisfied when the earlier sentence makes reference to the report of the Senior Superintendent of Police for detaining Dr <NAME> on the ground of his being at large to be prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order The possibilities of such forces of disorder spreading to other parts of the country satisfied him with the necessity of taking immediate action to neutralize those forces It appears from his statements in paras and of the same affidavit that actual disturbances took place at Patna that day and that he had to operate from the Control Room Section of the Preventive Detention Act reads The Central <ORG> or the State <ORG> may a if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to i the defence of India the relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India or ii the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order or iii When this Court used this expression in place of maintenance of public order I cannot conclude as urged by the petitioner that the District Magistrate using the expression maintenance of law and order in place of maintenance of public ordee is any indication of the fact that he had not applied his mind to the requirements of the provisions of or had not actually come to the conclusion that it was necessary to detain Dr <NAME> with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order If the District Magistrate was satisfied as the impugned order and the affidavit of the District Magistrate show that he was satisfied that it was necessary to detain Dr <NAME> with a view to preventing him from acting prejudicially to public safety that itself would have justified his passing the impugned order There is no room for considering that he might not have passed the impugned order merely with one object in view the object being to prevent Dr <NAME> from acting prejudicially to public safety It was so held as otherwise the orders passed for purposes not sanctioned by the Consti tution would have been in accordance with the law held valid The question is whether the District Magistrate would have made the order of detention on his satisfaction merely to the effect that it was necessary to detain Dr <NAME> with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety satisfaction it was incumbent on him to pass the order and he must have passed it I am therefore of opinion that the District Magistrate made the impugned detention order on his being satisfied that it was necessary to do so with a view to prevent Dr <NAME> from acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order and that the impugned order is valid this <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain it In the second place his contention is that the order of detention made against the petitioner being one under the Defence of India Rules he cannot challenge the validity of his detention thereunder in any court In that case this <ORG> has while holding that the right of a person whose detention has been ordered under the Defence of India Rules to move any court for the enforcement of his rights under Art But what would be the position in a case where an order for detention purporting to be made under the Defence of India Rules was itself one which was beyond the scope of the Rules For before an entry into the portals of this <ORG> can be denied to detenu he I must be shown an order under of the Defence of India Rules made by a competent authority stating that it is satisfied though it purports to be under order if the <ORG> finds that it was not competently made or was ambiguous it must exercise its powers under Art Under an order of detention of a person can be made with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India and civil defence public safety the maintenance of public order India relations with foreign powers the maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part of India the efficient conduct of military operations or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community The question posed by the argument is whether an authority competent to make an order under the aforesaid provision can make such an order on the ground that the authority feels it necessary to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order The expression law and ordee does not find any place in the rule and is not synonymous with public order Under no power is conferred upon that authority to detain a person on the ground that it is necessary so to do in order to prevent that person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the main tenance of order in a local area What is it that the District Magistrate Patna had in mind when he ordered the detention of the petitioner Was the apprehension entertained by the District Magistrate that Dr <NAME> if left at large was likely to do some thing which will imperil the maintenance of public order generally or was it that he apprehended that Dr <NAME> activities may cause disturbances in a particular locality There is thus an ambiguity on the face of the order and therefore the order must be held to be bad Or on the other hand he would have made the order solely upon that ground His order however which is the only material on the basis of which we can properly consider the matter gives no indication that the District Magistrate would have been prepared to make it only upon the ground relating to public safety In the circumstances I agree with my brethren <NAME> and <NAME> that the order of detention cannot be sustained ORDER In view of the majority opinion we allow the Petition and order that the petitioner be set at liberty
