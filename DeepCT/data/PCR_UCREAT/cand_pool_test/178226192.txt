Challenge in these appeals is to the direction given to the <ORG> by <ORG> of <ORG> to dispose of application for renewal filed by the respondents expeditiously in the background of views expressed on the factual aspects Shorn of theatric and bereft of legal controversy which constitutes bulk of the armoury as regards attack to the legality of judgment of <ORG> by which four Letters Patent Appeals were disposed of the factual background is as follows There is a marked distinction between periods have been prescribed for currency of the concerned permits Though applications for renewal were filed with requisite fees no express order was passed in any of the cases declining to grant permit Grievance is made that no reason has been indicated and there is also no reference to any policy decision for not effecting the renewal With reference to earlier order passed by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and Anr In the said case <ORG> noticed that renewal of permission was not a matter of right since there was change in <ORG> policy <ORG> was appointed which submitted its recommendations and in that view of the matter there was no question of directing renewal of the permits The High <ORG> inter alia came to the conclusions that renewal of the permit is a valuable right it could be refused only on cogent and valid grounds though plea was taken that the renewal period was mentioned by mistake same appears to be an afterthoughts and the concerned authorities were required to consider the prayer for renewal of the permit in accordance with law It was highlighted that in respect of vessels a departure was made from the so called policy and they were permitted to fish in the concerned zone By way of reply to the submissions made by learned counsel for the respondents learned Solicitor General submitted that directions were not merely to consider Had it been so and the matter would have been left open to be decided in accordance with law there could have been no difficulty Even if it is conceded for the sake of argument that there was anything improper in the permission granted it may be ground for taking action against the concerned vessels but it cannot be a ground to renew licence of the applicants If at the time when the matter is taken up for considering whether renewal to be granted there is a change in policy it cannot be said that the right is defeated by introduction of a policy Indisputably public interest has to prevail over private interest The case at hand shows that a conscious policy decision has been taken and there is no statutory compulsion to act contrary As highlighted by learned counsel for the appellants even if it is accepted that there was any improper permission that may render such permissions vulnerable so far as vessels are concerned But it cannot come to the aid of respondents In such matters there is no discrimination involved A basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is not impediment in adopting the procedure the deviation to act in different manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable itself shall be labelled as arbitrary As Professor <NAME> points out in Administrative Law by <NAME> th Edition there is ample room within the legal boundaries for radical differences of opinion in which neither side is unreasonable In a given case whether there are such facts and circumstance giving rise to legitimate expectation would primarily be a question of fact Moreover the negotiation of a legitimate expectation falling short of a legal right is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise accords with law If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary discriminatory unfair or biased gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles It can be one of the grounds to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference It depends very much on the facts and the recognized general principles of administrative law applicable to such facts and the concept of legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative action must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative power in a particular case It follows that the concept of legitimate expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasure of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the court out of review on the merits particularly when the element of speculation and uncertainty is inherent in that very concept Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interests of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interest of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration Keeping in view the analysis made of legal positions and in the absence of any material to discount legitimacy of policy the respondents have not made out a case for interference
