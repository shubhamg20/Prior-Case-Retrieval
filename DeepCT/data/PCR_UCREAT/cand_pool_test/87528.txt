Interpretation of statutes Whether some words may be used in different senses in the Same sentence Clause A of the Order prohibited transport movement or otherwise carrying of paddy outside the State by road or rail or otherwise except under and in accordance with the conditions of a permit issued by an officer authorised in that behalf It has different shades of meaning and must take its colour from the context in which it is used having regard to the purpose and object of the legislation and the <ORG> must necessarily keep in view the mischief which the legislature seeks to remedy The source of power to issue an order under cl of sub of there is no justification for giving a restricted meaning to the word regulating in cl of sub A word may be used in two different senses in the same section <NAME> for the Respondents The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN This appeal by special leave directed against the judgment and order of <ORG> dated September raises a question of some complexity That depends on whether the delegation of a specific power under cl of sub There is a conflict OF opinion on this question between different <ORG> After hearing the parties we dismissed the appeal by an order dated December for reasons to follow Cl of this Order empowers <ORG> to impose and collect levy upto of the purchase of paddy and rice by the dealers other than retail dealers and they are paid prices notified by the <ORG> No dated January and to collect levy on the purchases of paddy and rice by dealers even though it had the power to impose levy upto at prices fixed by it from time to time There was a failure of monsoon in the State in the years and the off take of rice in the fair price shops had increased from tonnes in April to tonnes in December No extending the provision made with regard to Thanjavur district of Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil taluks in South Arcot district and Musiri Kulithalai Lalgudi and Tiruchirapalli taluks in Tiruchirapalli district In exercise of the powers conferred by of the Essential Commodities Act and in supersession of the Order of the Government of India in the late <ORG> Department of Food No dated the th June <ORG> hereby directs that the powers conferred on it by sub a i ii and of sub thereof shall in relation to foodstuffs be exercisable also by a State Government subject to the conditions that such powers shall be exercised by a State Government subject to such directions if any as may be issued by the Central Government in this behalf that before making an order relating to any matter specified in the said cls The appellant and various other agriculturists of Thanjavur district and the aforesaid traditionally rice growing areas of South Arcot and Thiruchirapalli districts challenge the constitutional validity of cl A of the Order placing a complete ban on the transport movement or otherwise carrying of paddy outside Thanjavur district and the aforementioned taluks of South Arcot and Thiruchirapalli districts by petitions under Art There were as many as writ petitions in <ORG> which were disposed of by the judgment under appeal <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellant argued the case with much learning and resource In order to appreciate the contentions advanced it would be convenient to set out the relevant statutory provisions If the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices or for securing any essential commodity for the defence of India or the efficient conduct of military operations it may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein Sub Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub an order made thereunder may provide a for regulating by licences permits or otherwise the storage transport distribution disposal acquisition use or consumption of any essential commodity There must be some meaningful effect given to the words <ORG> hereby directs that the powers conferred on it by sub On a plain construction the first part of the aforesaid notification in specific terms provides for the delegation by <ORG> under of the Act of the powers conferred on it by sub That power is general in its terms and authorises inter alia the promulgation of any order providing for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in any essential commodity insofar as it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices The second part of the notification directs that the power to make orders thereunder i the power under sub for the matters specified in clauses a i ii and of sub thereof and subject to such conditions set out therein Learned counsel for the appellant however strenuously con tends that the delegation of powers by <ORG> under of the Act must necessarily be in relation to such matters and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification of of the Act which uses the word regulating and take it out of the purview of sub of which uses the words regulating or prohibiting As already indicated the source of power to make an order of this description is sub of of the Act and sub merely provides illustration for the general powers conferred by sub There the <ORG> was considering the validity of the Sugar and sugar Products Control Order issued by the then <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred on it by of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act by virtue of the delegation of powers by <ORG> to make orders in relation to foodstuffs under cl of sub <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> explaining the relevant functions of sub ss It is manifest that sub A the or other powers on <ORG> than what are conferred under sub for it is an order made thereunder that may provide for one or two other of the matter specifically enumerated in sub which are only illustrative as such enumeration is without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub Seizure of an article being thus shown to fall within the purview of sub it must be competent for <ORG> or its delegate <ORG> to make an order for seizure under that sub section apart from and irrespective of the anticipated contravention of any other order as contemplated in cl of sub <ORG> in that case held of the Defence of India Rules made under cl of sub of of the Defence of India Act to be ultra vires which decision was reversed by <ORG> The Court quoted with approval the following observations of Lord <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> In the opinion of their Lordships the function of sub is merely an illustrative one the rule making power is conferred by sub and the rules which are referred to in the opening sentence of sub are the rules which are authorized by and made under sub the provisions of sub are not restrictive of sub as indeed is expressly stated by the words without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub <NAME> <NAME> as he then was held that the powers to promulgate the levy order was derived from sub of of the Act and that the power was general in terms and authorized inter alia the promulgation of any order providing for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in any essential commodity insofar as it appears necessary or expedient to <ORG> for maintaining or increasing supplies or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices The Matters Specified in sub being without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub must be held to include such powers The <ORG> has been given powers limited to foodstuffs only Quite recently <ORG> in <NAME> State of West Bengal and <NAME> State of West Bengal following the dictum of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case supra have held that the delegation of specific powers to issue an impugned order of this nature is derived from sub thereof are merely illustrative It has further held that the various clauses of sub LJ CWN under of the Act without deriving the general powers under sub We are of the considered opinion that the view of <ORG> accords both with reason and principle The view to the contrary taken by the Punjab Allahabad and Orissa <ORG> in <NAME> It must accordingly be held that although cl of sub of of the Act deals only with a specific power the general power to issue the impugned order flows from the provisions of sub If the contention of the learned counsel were to be accepted it would imply that <ORG> derives its power under sub If <ORG> were to make an order under sub in respect of the matters specified in cl it may not only regulate or control the storage transport distribution etc Of an essential commodity including the movement of such foodstuffs by grant of licenses permits or otherwise but also place a ban on the movement of wheat from one place to another but <ORG> under cl has only a regulatory power in relation thereto i to make an order only for regulating the movement of wheat from one place to another by issue of the permits licenses or otherwise as provided for by cl of the impugned Order but could not have issued cl IA placing a ban on movement of wheat from one place to another Although by force of logic one may be driven to that conclusion that <ORG> has power to promulgate cl of the impugned Order but not cl IA there is no reason for us to give such a restrictive meaning to the word regulating appearing in cl of sub it would seem that the rule of construction is clearly well recognized that a word may be used in two different senses in the same section of an Act to of the Constitution and therefore the view taken in <NAME> case is not applicable He therefore submits that cl IA of the Order was ultra vires because the State Government had only power under cl grant of permits licenses or otherwise in contradistinction to the A power of <ORG> under sub In <NAME> case the question arose whether two provisos framed by <ORG> under of the Mysore Forest Act which empowered the making of rules to regulate the transit of forest produce which placed absolute prohibition against transportation of forest produce between sunset and sunrise and a qualified prohibition in certain circumstances was beyond the rule making power of <ORG> It is a word of broad import having a broad meaning and is very comprehensive in scope It has often been said that the power to regulate does not necessarily include the power to prohibit and ordinarily the word regulate is not synonymous with the word prohibit We may illustrate how different minds have differently reacted as to the meaning of the word regulate depending on the context in which it is used and the purpose and object of the legislation In <NAME> Naylor the question arose before <ORG> whether a bye law by reason of its prohibition internment altogether in a particular cemetry was ultra vires because <ORG> had only power of regulating internments whereas the bye law totally prohibited them in the cemetry in question and it was said by Lord <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> A rule or bye law cannot be held as ultra vires merely because it prohibits where empowered to regulate as regulation often involved prohibition In contrast in <ORG> Virgo where the question for decision was whether a section or a bye law prohibiting hawkers from plying their trade was competently and validity made Lord <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> while laying down that a power to make a bye law to regulate and govern a trade does not authorize the prohibition of such trade and added There is a marked distinction between the prohibition or prevention of a trade and the regulation or governance of it and indeed a power to regulate and govern seems to imply the continued existence of that which is to be regulated or governed We find no lawful justification for giving a restricted meaning to the word regulating in cl In State of Tamil Nadu Hind Stone and Ors the Court has held that a restriction placed on movement of wheat from one State to another and on movement of wheat from one district to another under cl of sub Surely when a part of the country is verging on conditions of acute shortage or even famine it is expected of the government to procure foodstuffs from surplus areas and transport the same for distribution in deficit areas The source of power to issue an order under cl
