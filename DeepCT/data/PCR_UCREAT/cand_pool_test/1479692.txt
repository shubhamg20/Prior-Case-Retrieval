There is no Jaw in this country which prevents one of several co proprietors holding the status of a tenant under the other co proprietors of land which appertains to the common estate Sub section of Section of the present Tenancy Act does however provide that if an occupancy right is transferred to a person jointly interested in the land as proprietor the occupancy right shall cease to exist It is not said and the Sub section cannot be understood to mean that the holding shall cease to exist but that the occupancy right which is an incident to the holding will cease to exist and there is nothing in the Sub section inconsistent with the continuance of the holding divested of this right of occupancy which attached to it The saving clause in the Sub section that nothing in it shall prejudicially affect the right of any third person indicates also that the holding would for some purposes at all events continue to exist I therefore think that the appeal must be dismissed with costs
