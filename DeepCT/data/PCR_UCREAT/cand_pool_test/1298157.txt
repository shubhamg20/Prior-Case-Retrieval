respondents right under Art HELD i Section is merely regulatory if it was not complied with the appellants may probably be exposed to a penalty but a competitor in the business could not seek to prevent the appellants from exercising their right to carry on business because of the default nor could the rice mill of the appellants be regarded as a new rice mill Even assuming that no previous permission was obtained the respondents would have no locus standi for challenging the grant of the permission because no right vested in the respondents was infringed By it is made one of the conditions of the licence that the location of the rice mill shall not be shifted without the previous permission of <ORG> But there is no statutory obligation imposed upon him to take into consideration the matters prescribed by sub of in granting the permission to change the location The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is filed with special leave against the judgment of <ORG> setting aside the order dated January of the Director of Food Civil Supplies of the State of Mysore under the Rice Milling Industry Regulation Act of By order dated January the Director of <ORG> passed an order sanctioing the change in the location of the appellants rice mill from its original site to the new site as per the provisions contained in section of the Rice Milling Industry Regulation Act and rejected the objection raised by the respondents In the view of the Court by the shifting of the appellants rice mill the respondents business was directly affected and they had a right to challenge the legality of the order <ORG> upheld the claim of the respondents on the sole ground that the order of the Director was made in violation of the mandatory in junction of the Rice Milling Industry Regulation Act of and it prejudicially affected the business of the respondents as rice millers By a a defunct rice mill is defined as meaning a rice mill in existence at the commencement of this Act but in which rice Milling operations have not been carried on for a period exceeding one year prior to such commencement By sub of it is provided that any person or authority may make an application to <ORG> for the grant of permit for the establishment of a new rice mill and any owner of a defunct rice mill may make a like application for the grant of a permit for re commencing rice milling operation in such mill The Court observed that where an officer granting a licence or passing an administrative order exceeds his powers and makes an order in violation of the provision which clothes him with that power his order is liable to be struck down and since contemplated grant of permission for change of location before the plant and the machinery were actually shifted to a new site the Director of <ORG> had no power to grant permission after the machinery and plant had been shifted The right to carry on business being a fundamental right under Art of the Constitution its exercise is subject only to the restrictions imposed by law in the interests of the general public under Art Section is merely regulatory if it is not complied with the appellants may probably be exposed to a penalty but a competitor in the business cannot seek to prevent the appellants from exercising their right to carry on business because of the default nor can the rice mill of the appellants be regard as a new rice mill Counsel submitted that sub of was enacted with a view to ensure adequate mining facilities and to prevent unfair competition and on that account it is provided that when the location of an existing rice mill has to be shifted the authority had to take into consideration the number of rice mills operating in the locality the availability of power and water supply for the rice mill in respect of which a permit is applied for whether the functioning of the rice mill in respect of which a permit is applied for would cause substantial unemployment in the locality and such other particulars as may be prescribed By it is made one of the conditions of the licence that the location of the rice mill shall not be shifted without the previous permission of <ORG> But there is no statutory obligation imposed upon him to take into consideration the matters prescribed by sub of in granting the permission to change the location This was done with a view to cause minimum hardship to the appel lants arising in consequence of the proposed construction of the dam resulting in submergence of their land The State also granted permission to the appellants to change the location under the Rice Milling Industry Regulation Act The appeal is allowed and the petition filed by the respondent <ORG> is ordered to be dismissed with costs throughout in favour of the appellants
