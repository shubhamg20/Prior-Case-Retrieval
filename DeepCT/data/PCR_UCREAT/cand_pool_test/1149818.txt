was deducted under Section as it stood at the relevant time should be the figure that should be taken into account It is necessary to refer to Section as it stood at that time In the case of a company to which this section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent This section applies to a an Indian company or any other company which has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends including dividends on preference shares within India but does not apply to any Indian company referred to in Clause a or to any other company referred to in Clause if such Indian or other company is a company referred to in Section and its total income as computed before applying the provisions of Sub section does not exceed twenty five thousand rupees Chapter IV of the Income tax Act deals with the computation of income falling under the various heads mentioned in Section of the Act and Chapter VI in which Section occurs deals with the aggregation of income and set off or carry forward of loss Section in Chapter VIA deals with deductions to be made in computing total income Computation as such is used only in the heading in Chapter IV Section also provides that in computing the total income of an assessee there shall be included all income on which no income tax is payable under Chapter VII etc What is provided in Section is also relating to computation Similarly the same words are used in Section But there are no such words in Section Section speaks of the net result of the computation under the head Profits and gains of business or profession We consider that the set off permitted under Section is from an amount arrived at after applying the provisions of Chapter IV along with other sections of the Act such as Sections and etc We therefore think that the deduction under Section is a special benefit given to a company which satisfies the conditions under Section and the deduction of per cent This benefit should not be diminished by the other benefits conferred by the Act such as the right to have the previous losses set off The two serve different purposes and the benefit of both must be available to an assessee without the one impinging on the other We therefore answer the question referred to us in the negative that is in favour of the assessee and against the department
