The third mortgagee brought a suit for sale on the footing of his mortgage and the appellant set up in this suit a claim to be substituted for the two prior mortgagees whose debt he had discharged But the section does not say so and there is no apparent reason why a person who has advanced money for the purpose named in the section should not be regarded as within the section simply because the mortgagor has given him a mortgage to secure the advance made But in such case the right to subrogation is made by the section a matter of express contract between the mortgagor and the person who has advanced him the money There is no right to subrogation unless the mortgagor has by registered instrument agreed that the person advancing the money shall be subrogated in respect of the mortgage or mortgages discharged The question whether a mortgage paid off is kept alive of extinguished depends upon the intention of the parties and this intention in the absence of any declared intention is to be inferred from the circumstances Mohesh Lal <NAME> Quoting an English authority they said If there is no reason for keeping it the incumbrance alive then especially in the Case of an owner in fee equity will in the absence of any declaration of intention destroy it but if there be any reason for keeping it alive such as the existence of another incumbrance equity will not destroy it In the absence of any particular circumstance to the contrary there is no room for inferring that the appellant was intended to be substituted for the three mortgagees whom he had contracted to pay at it was observed by Ramesam that Where a mortgagor sells his property to a vendee requiring the vendee to pay off two or three prior debts of the mortgagor and if the vendee pays off only one of them he cannot claim priority in respect of it over the others though he may claim such priority in respect of some other debts the payment of which by him was not contemplated On behalf of the respondent it has been argued that the principle enunciated by <NAME> <NAME> is correct and is equally applicable to the case of a mortgagee that Act XX of is not retrospective in its operation and that even under Section as amended the appellant will not obtain priority as the case must be held to be governed by Clause and not by Clause of that section If on the other hand Act XX of must be held to have changed the law prevailing prior thereto it is difficult to agree that the learned Judges were giving full effect to the concluding words of Section of Act XX of because in that case the suit was undoubtedly pending when the Act of came into force and that section not merely provides that the Act shall not affect anything already done in any pending proceeding but goes on to say that such proceeding may be continued as if this Act had not been passed It will be seen from the report of <ORG> which considered the Bill that they assumed that under the previous state of the law a transferee from a mortgagor who has undertaken to discharge a prior mortgage debt cannot by the mere fact of paying off a prior mortgage claim subrogation though in certain circumstances the <ORG> may presume an intention on his part to keep alive the security thus paid off by him To meet such cases they recommended the provision now enacted as Clause of Section whereunder a person advancing money to a mortgagor to pay off a prior mortgage shall be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee thus redeemed only if the mortgagor has by registered instrument agreed that such person shall be so subrogated at as conventional subrogation and it gives effect to the decision in <NAME> <NAME> I A I Cal Mr <NAME> contends that the third clause must be held to apply only to cases in which a person advances money without taking a mortgage therefore There is a well established distinction between cases in which a person who has a preexisting interest in property pays off a prior charge on that property for the protection of his own interest and cases in which a person acquires an interest in property only by reason of his advancing money to pay off an existing mortgage debt It seems to me that the first clause of Section must be held to relate to the first type of cases above referred to and the third clause to the second type does not appear to have been brought to the notice of the learned Judges and it seems to me unaccountable that when referring to the <ORG> decision in Ayyareddi <NAME> I Mad <ORG> point out that Section of the Transfer of Property Act deals only with cases in which there is a possibility of merger by reason of the prior mortgage interest and the residuary ownership vesting in the same person and the observations made in cases relating to discharge of prior mortgages by a person who has become owner of the property ought not to be applied to a case of discharge by a puisne mortgagee because in the latter case no question of merger can arise It is true that Section will in terms apply only to an owner paying off a prior charge and not to a mortgagee paying off a prior charge but in the judgments in <NAME> <NAME> I A I Cal at as the case of a purchaser whose interest it may be to extinguish the mortgage is somewhat misleading for their Lordships discuss the question of intention not merely from the point of view of <NAME> the purchaser but also from the point of view of the plaintiff who was the mortgagee that lent the money utilised to pay off the prior mortgage in favour of <ORG> It is some times said that a presumption most beneficial to the person paying off the prior charge can be made only when two courses are open to him in law but no such option can be recognised in favour of a person who has bound himself by covenant to pay off another encumbrance also <NAME> Sheo Mangal A I All Again it has been said that subrogation is only a rule of equity and it cannot be allowed where its application will lead to injustice or inequitable results Whichever of these views be held to be the true basis of the rule it can make no difference whether the subrogation is claimed by a purchaser or a puisne incumbrancer so long as there is a covenant between him and his transferor that the transferee should discharge the debt due to the person whom he seeks to postpone There is no doubt a difference between a covenant in a sale deed about payment of consideration and a similar covenant in a mortgage deed in that the latter covenant may not be specifically enforced and even damages for its breach may ordinarily be nominal but it is nonetheless a legal covenant which may in certain circumstances sustain a claim for substantial damages see A No of see also <ORG> A Cook and <ORG> quoting from the <ORG> <NAME> at and <NAME> <ORG> Ex In the <ORG> case the learned Judges say at the bottom of that there appears to be no difference between the case of a purchaser or mortgagee paying off a prior charge out of his own funds and at his own choice and the case where he pays off the prior charge out of funds forming part of the consideration for the transfer in his favour I agree with the judgments just delivered at I A It is now settled law that where in India there are several mortgages on a property the owner of the property subject to the mortgages may if he pays off an earlier charge treat himself as buying it and stand in the same position as his vendor or to put it in another way he may keep the incumbrance alive for his benefit and thus come in before a later mortgagee But Mr <NAME> contends that this rule of law would apply to the case of a purchaser but not to that of a mortgagee Assuming Section to be retrospective I am with due respect unable to agree with the interpretation placed on Clause Clauses and of Section must be read together Clause enunciates no new principle vide Section of the Transfer of Property Act since repealed It applies to all persons who have an interest in Equity of Redemption and are under no personal obligation to discharge prior incumbrances Clause has been enacted to confer a benefit on persons who advance money to discharge an incumbrance only if the mortgagee has by a registered instrument agreed that such persons shall be subrogated The clause is intended to apply to all persons who acquire an interest in the mortgaged property by advancing moneys to discharge prior incumbrances and there is no warrant for restricting the scope of that clause to persons other than purchasers or mortgagees as contended by Mr <NAME> The distinction between the two classes of cases aforesaid namely those who have an existing interest in the property and those who acquire an interest therein by advancing money is well recognised in the law relating to subrogation There is no registered instrument as required by Clause in this case and the appellant claim is unsustainable
