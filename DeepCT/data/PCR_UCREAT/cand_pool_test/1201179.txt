The proviso was in the following terms Provided further that no allowance under this clause shall be made in respect of any machinery or plant which consists of office appliances or road transport vehicles The assessee being aggrieved by the disallowance of the claim applied to the <ORG> for a reference and on the application of the assessee the <ORG> referred the following question for the determination of the court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case was the assessee entitled to the disallowance of development rebate on lorries purchased during the relevant previous year for the assessment year It was indisputable that if the proviso applied no allowance by way of development rebate could be claimed by the assessee in respect of the eight new trucks purchased by the assessee during the relevant previous year and an attempt was therefore made on behalf of the assessee to exclude the applicability of the proviso by contending that the proviso had no retrospective operation and could not be so construed as to affect the vested right of the assessee to claim development rebate in respect of the said trucks The argument of the assessee was that the Taxation Laws Amendment Act which introduced the proviso in Section vib was enacted on th September and was therefore ineffective to affect the right which became vested in the assessee on st April to claim development rebate under the then existing law This argument is plainly incorrect for it overlooks Section Sub section of the Taxation Laws Amendment Act I which says in terms that subject to any special provision made in this behalf in that Act it shall be deemed to have come into force on st April The proviso being in force on st April was clearly and indubitably applicable and by reason of the proviso no allowance could be claimed by the assessee in respect of the eight new trucks purchased during the year of account The assessee will pay the costs of the reference to the Commissioner
