PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT STATE OF PUNJAB DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> RAMASWAMY AGRAWAL <NAME> CITATION SCC JT SCALE ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT The Judgments of the Court were delivered by <NAME> on behalf of himself <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The above batch of matters consisting of a number of writ petitions criminal appeals and SLPs are filed challenging the vires of the Terrorist Affected Areas Special Courts Act No The above Act of applicable to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir received the assent of the President on August replacing Ordinance No of promulgated on July the object of which is to provide for the speedy trial of certain offenses in terrorist affected areas and for matters connected therewith Section of this Act defines the expression terrorist affected area as an area declared as a terrorist affected area under Section which provision empowers <ORG> by notification to declare any area to be terrorist affected area and constitute such area into a single judicial zone or into as many judicial zones as it may deem fit provided in its opinion the offenses of the nature specified in the Schedule appended to that Act are being committed in any area by terrorists on such a scale and in such a manner that it is expedient for the purpose of coping with such terrorists to have recourse to the provisions of the Act The notification issued under Section in respect of an area should specify the period during which the area shall for the purpose of this Act be a terrorist affected area As per Section a notification under Section in respect of an area specifying the period during which the area shall for the purpose of this Act be a terrorist affected area and where <ORG> is of the opinion that the terrorists had been committing in that area from the date earlier than the date of issue of the notification offenses of the nature specified in the Schedule on such a scale and in such a manner that it is expedient to commence the period specified in the notification from such earlier date the period specified in the notification may commence from that date subject to the proviso thereto It has been brought to our notice by Mr <NAME> the learned Additional Solicitor General that <ORG> established judicial zones in Jullundur Patiala Ferozepur and Chandigarh but abolished them by Notification Nos and dated September and transferred the cases pending before those courts to ordinary courts This Act which received the assent of the President on May and was published in <ORG> Extra The provisions of this Act were made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir June The Bill as introduced sought to make provisions for combating the menace of terrorists and disruptionists inter alia to a provide for deterrent punishment for terrorist acts and disruptive activities confer on <ORG> adequate powers to make such rules as may be necessary or expedient for the prevention of and for coping with terrorist acts and disruptive activities and provide for the constitution of Designated Courts for the speedy and expeditious trial of offenses under the proposed legislation This Act in all contains sections which are segregated into four parts i Part Sections to Part Sections to Part III Sections to and Part IV Sections to dealing with punishment for and measures for coping with terrorist and disruptive activities constitution of Designated Courts constituted under Section of the Act its jurisdiction and powers the procedure to be followed production of witnesses appointment of Public Prosecutors and the provision for appeal as a matter of right from any judgment sentence or order not being an interlocutory order of the court direct to <ORG> both on facts and law vide Sections to and other miscellaneous provisions regarding the modified application of certain provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure competence of <ORG> to exercise powers of State Government and delegation of powers power of <ORG> of India to make rules etc Since both the Houses of Parliament were not in session and it was necessary to take immediate action the President promulgated the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Ordinance of on May which came into force May However this Act repealing the Ordinance received the assent of the President of India on September and was published in <ORG> Extra The scheme of the special provisions of these two Acts were are for the prevention of and for coping with terrorist and disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Thereafter as it was felt that the Act should continue the President promulgated an Ordinance whereby for the words four years six years were substituted in sub section of Section The provisions under Part IV under the heading Miscellaneous deal with the modified application of certain provisions of the Code presumption as to offenses under Section identification of accused power of <ORG> to make rules etc Sharma <NAME> <NAME> assisted by a team of lawyers <ORG><ORG>s <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <ORG>ohan Pandey all appearing for the petitioners<ORG>appellants made the most virulent fusillade against the constitutional validity of all the Acts in general and the various provisions of those Acts in particular mainly on the grounds that that <ORG> has no legislative competence to enact the legislations and these impugned Acts or some of the provisions of these Acts are in contravention of or ostensibly in violation of any of the fundamental rights specified in Part III of the Constitution they also triggered off a volley of attacks against the validity of the provisions of these Acts<ORG>on some other grounds also According to them these Acts and the provisions thereto which are in utter disregard and breach of humanitarian law and universal human rights not only lack impartiality but also fail the basic test of justice and fairness which are well established and recognised principles of law At present they have outstretched their activities by spreading their wings far and wide almost bringing the major part of the country under the extreme violence and terrorism by letting loose unprecedented and unprovoked repression and disruption unmindful of the security of the nation personal liberty and right inclusive of the right to live with human dignity of the innocent citizens of this country and destroying the image of many glitzy cities like Chandigarh Srinagar Delhi and Bombay by strangulating the normal life of the citizens Everyday there are jarring pieces of information through electronic and print media that many innocent defenseless people particularly poor politicians statesmen government officials police officials army personnel inclusive of the jawans belonging to <ORG> have been mercilessly gunned down Whatever may be the reasons indeed there is none to deny that On April the then Home Minister in his speech before <ORG> stated thus As I told in the beginning the forces working to destabilize the country are bein encouraged from outside as well as inside of the country According to the information received it appears that its master mind is somewhere else and it is also inside <NAME> as he then was speaking for the majority observed I know that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality of a legislative measure the court can take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and also assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of the legislation Law is made not to be broken but to be obeyed and the respect for law is not retained by demonstration of strength but by better appreciation of the reasons better understanding of its reality and implicit obedience There is no known method of retaining them but eternal vigilance There is no known authority to which this duty can be delegated but the community itself With the above brief introduction we shall now proceed to deal with the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties with reference to the main questions firstly whether the Acts suffer from lack of legislative competence and secondly whether the Acts or any of the provisions thereof contravene any fundamental right specified in Part III of the Constitution as well as other cognate questions It has been seriously contended by Mr <NAME> Senior Counsel that Act of TADA is ultra vires since the Central <ORG> namely the <ORG> lacked legislative competence under Article read with the topics of legislation enumerated in List I Union List and List III Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution to enact the TADA Act and that the subject matter of the impugned Acts in fact fell within the legislative field assigned to the States under Entry of List II State List namely Public Order which is a most comprehensive term with widest import encompassing every activity which leads to violence or disturbs public tranquility According to him the above entry is left with only offenses against laws with respect to matters specified in subsequent entries of the Concurrent List However this will not justify giving any other meaning to Entry of List III namely Criminal law and Entry in List II namely Public order read with Entry and Entry of that list Elaborating some of the entries of List II it has been urged that the legislative power of the <ORG> to enact laws under Public order is contained in Entry I of List II and the power of the <ORG> to create the police investigating agency is under Entry of List II and the legislative power to vest jurisdiction and confer powers on courts to try such <ORG> offenses calls under Entry of List II and that a combined reading of the excluding clause of Entry I of List III and Entry of List I and Entry of List II completely exempts offenses relating to Public order from the heading Criminal law under Entry I of List III It has been further urged that the legislative power of the <ORG> under Articles and and read with List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution in regard to creating offenses under Entry of List I extends only to matters enumerated in that list and under Entry of List III in regard to matters in subsequent entries of that list Supplementing the above arguments Mr <NAME> Senior Counsel advanced the other facet of the argument stating that this Act of in pith and substance relates to Public order as reflected from its preamble itself declaring the Act to be an Act to make special provisions for the prevention of and for coping with terrorist and disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Mr Tulsi the learned Additional Solicitor General in hi attempt to expose the fallacy of the above submissions stated that the highly AIR PC IA CWN SCR AIR SC SCC SCR SCR AIR SC Cri LJ SCR AIR SC Cri LJ classified and strictly confidential information collected by and received from <ORG> which information is not to be disclosed in public interest unmistakably unfolds that the secessionists forces working to destabilize the sovereignty of India and its integrity are being encouraged by the neighboring countries and that there are many training camps on the borders of India where training is imparted to militants and terrorists not only in the use of sophisticated and heavy weapons including rocket launchers machine guns mines explosives and wireless communications but also to indulge in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which unassailable facts are a matter of common knowledge and which can be taken into consideration by way of judicial notice We shall now carefully examine the submissions made by the respective parties in the light of the import and intendment of the Acts under challenge and find out as to whether this Act TADA falls under Entry of List II namely Public order or under Entry of List I namely Defence of India as well as Entries and A of List I read with Entries I Criminal law and Criminal procedure of List III But before we do so we would briefly take note of the constitutional scheme relating to distribution of legislative powers between the <ORG> and the States Under clause of Article notwithstanding anything in clauses and of the said article <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the subjects enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule Under clause of the said article the State <ORG> have exclusive powers to make laws with respect to items enumerated in List II The powers in respect of the items enumerated in List III are concurrent i both <ORG> and the <ORG> of any State subject to clause have power to make laws With regard to a law made in respect of matters enumerated in the Concurrent List provision has been made in Article which gives overriding effect to a law made by <ORG> in the event of there being any repugnancy between the said law and the law made by the <ORG> of a State and the State law would prevail over a law made by <ORG> only if such State law was enacted after the law made by <ORG> and has received the assent of the President It is therefore necessary to examine whether the Act falls within the ambit of Entry read with Entry of the State List as contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners down that the entries must not be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense and that widest amplitude must be given to the language of these entries This doctrine of pith and substance is applied when the legislative competence of a legislature with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists i a law dealing with the subject in one list is also touching on a subject in another list On a scrutiny of the Act in question if found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature enacting that statute then that Act as a whole must be held to be valid notwithstanding any incidental trenching upon matters beyond its competence i on a matter included in the list belonging to the other legislature Public order but not including the use of any naval military or air force or any other armed force of the <ORG> or of any other force subject to the control of the <ORG> or of any contingent or unit thereof in aid of the civil power Under the Government of India Act <ORG> had been conferred the power to enact laws in respect of matters enumerated in the Provincial List and Item I of the Provincial List covered the field of public order but not including the use of His Majesty naval military or air forces in aid of the civil power After referring to Entry of the Concurrent List the <ORG> has observed The Constitution thus requires a line to be drawn in the field of public order or tranquility marking off may be roughly the boundary between those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> and the relatively minor breaches of the peace of a purely local significance treating for this purpose differences in degree as if they were differences in kind One has to imagine three concentric circles Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of <ORG> It is then easy to see that an act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but not security of the <ORG> Having regard to the limitation placed by Article on the legislative power of <ORG> State in the matter of enactment of laws having application within the territorial limits of the State only the ambit of the field of legislation with respect to public order under Entry in the State List has to be confined to disorders of lesser gravity having an impact within the boundaries of the State Activities of a more serious nature which threaten the security and integrity of the country as a whole would not be within the legislative field assigned to the States under Entry of the State List but would fall within the ambit of Entry of the Union List relating to defence of India and in any event under the residuary power conferred on <ORG> under Article read with Entry of the Union List The way in which the alleged violent crimes is shown to have been perpetrated the manner in which they have been cruelly executed the vulnerable territorial frontiers which form part of the scene of unprecedented and unprovoked occurrences lead to an inescapable illation and conclusion that the activities of the terrorists and disruptionists pose a serious challenge to the very existence of sovereignty as well as to the security of India notwithstanding the fact whether such threats or challenges come by way of external aggression or internal disturbance The above view gets strengthened from the very definition of the expression terrorist act as defined in Section of the Act of stating that the said expression has the meaning assigned to it in sub section of Section according to which the intention to commit any offence or offenses specified therein should be for one or more clearly defined objectives as expressly mentioned in Section reading Whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmon amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing Similarly the expression disruptive activity as defined under Section has the meaning assigned to it in Section For the purposes of sub section disruptive activity means any action taken whether by act or by speech or through any other media or in any other manner whatsoever i which questions disrupts or is intended to disrupt whether directly or indirectly the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or ii which is intended to bring about or supports any claim whether directly or indirectly for the cession of any part of India or the secession of any part of India from the <ORG> The above definitions would themselves make it clear that the expression Terrorist and Disruptive Activities deployed in the preamble of the Act of TADA contemplates the commission of any specified offence or offenses with a specific intention one of which being to overawe the Government as by law established vide Section and any action taken whether by act or by speech or through any other media or in any other manner whatsoever which questions disrupts or is intended to disrupt whether directly or indirectly the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or which is intended to bring about or supports any claim whether directly or indirectly for the cession of any part of India or the secession of any part of India from the Union The impugned Act therefore falls within the legislative competence of <ORG> in view of Article read with Entry of List I and it is not necessary to consider whether it falls under any of the entries in List I or List III We are however of the opinion that the impugned Act could fall within the ambit of Entry of List I namely Defence of India All the learned counsel who have challenged the vires of these Acts and the provisions thereof have advanced their legal arguments both topic wise as well as with reference to the individual provisions of the Acts According to them the procedural provisions of those Acts under the guise of speedy trial violate the venerated basic principles of fair trial held dear all along namely that every person will be presumed innocent till his guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt according to the procedure established by law Now let us examine the principle of speedy trial underlying in Act of TADA The right to a speedy trial is not only an important safeguard to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration to minimise anxiety and concern accompanying the accusation and to limit the possibility of impairing the ability of an accused to defend himself but also there is a societal interest in providing a speedy trial There can therefore be no doubt that speedy trial and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial is an integral and essential part of th fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article The question which would however arise is as to what would be the SCC Cri SCR consequence if a person accused of an offence is denied speedy trial and is sought to be deprived of his liberty by imprisonment as a result of a long delayed trial in violation of his fundamental right under Article Thus this <ORG> by a line of judicial pronouncements has emphasised and re emphasised that speedy trial is one of the facets of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article and the law must ensure reasonable just and fair procedure which has a creative connotation after the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> It secures rights to a defendant Yet another argument qua the just and fair trial read into Article has been submitted firstly contending when there is no proclamation of emergency in operation and when all the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution are available for enforcement the right to have a fair trial cannot be whittled down or militated against and secondly even when a proclamation of emergency is in operation the President under Article of the Constitution of India can by order declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and all the proceedings in any court for the enforcement of such rights shall remain suspended during the period of emergency but not the rights conferred by Articles and Prior to the enactment of the Constitution Forty fourth Amendment Act which came into force June all the rights conferred by Part III including the rights under Articles and could be suspended during emergency Recent experience has shown that the fundamental rights including those of life and liberty granted to citizens by the Constitution are capable of being taken away by a transient majority As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing it would be provided that the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be exercised in respect of the fundamental right to life and liberty Now we shall examine the key questions whether the procedure prescribed under the Acts of and is the antithesis of the just fair and reasonable procedure whether the procedural safeguards to which the accused is entitled to have been completely denied to the prejudice and disadvantage of the accused whether the Acts are tyrannical and despotical in character and discriminatory in application and whether the provisions of these Acts are violative of the fundamental rights embodied under Articles and We shall now give a close scrutiny to all those above complicated questions of unrivaled complexity debated before us which caused considerable anxiety to the <ORG> for reaching a satisfactory conclusion under different topics with reference to the various provisions of the Acts by carefully scanning through the legal submissions eloquently articulated by both sides and decide as to whether the provisions under challenge have to read them down or to read anything into them The definition of the word abet as defined under Section a of Act is as follows The word abet is generally used with the word aid and similar words A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of an offence or the commission of an act which would be an offence if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor The offence of abetment is committed by a person either by instigating a person to commit an offence or by engaging in a conspiracy to commit it or by intentionally aiding a person to commit it But there are exceptions to this rule and the reasons for this is that the legislature under certain situations and circumstances in its wisdom may think it so important in order to prevent a particular act from being committed to forbid or rule out the element of mens rea as a constituent part of a crime or of adequate proof of intention or actual knowledge The question is not what the word means but whether there are sufficient grounds for infer ring that the <ORG> intended to exclude the general rule that mens rea is an essential element for bringing any person under the definition of abet There are judicial decisions to the effect that it is generally necessary to go behind the words of the enactment and take other factors into consideration as to whether the element of mens rea or actual knowledge should be imported into the definition The nature of mens rea that will be implied in a statute creating an offence depends upon the object of the Act and the provisions thereof We shall now go into the question as to whether the legislature has imported the essential ingredient of criminal offence i mens rea in the substantive offenses of the Act of True the provisions of the TADA Acts are framed with very stringent provisions of course for the prevention of and for coping with terrorist and disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto In the backdrop of the above legal position we shall deal with the submissions made by the learned counsel with reference to the substantive offence or offences specified under the main Act itself But the definition of the word terrorist in that Act requires the person indulging in the act of terrorism to be shown to have committed the terrorist act with a view of committing any of the offences enumerated under clauses i to iv of the definition of the word terrorist given under Section The scheduled offences i Sections and of the Indian Penal Code expressly require intention on the part of the person committing those offences though intention is not required under Sections and A of the and Sections and of the Anti Hijacking Act which are also scheduled offences in that Act Under the note given to the Schedule it is stated that AIR PC Bom LR MLJ SCR AIR SC Cri LJ SCR AIR SC Cri LJ AIR Bom Bom LJ Cri LJ the offence of criminal conspiracy or attempt to commit or abetment of an offence specified in this Schedule shall be deemed to be a schedule offence Nonetheless Sections and of this Act which deal with punishments for the substantive offences of terrorism and disruption respectively make the abetment of both the substantive offences also as penal offences The definition of the word abet is given for the first time in the Act of TADA Section which gives the meaning of the expression terrorist specifically requires the intention on the part of the offender committing a terrorist act Similarly Section i and ii also requires that the person committing the disruptive act should be shown to have intended to do that act Thus it is very clear that the substantive offences require intention on the part of the person committing the terrorist act or the disruptive act As rightly pointed out the definition of the word abet as given in Section i is with wide flexibility rather than with meticulous specificity Therefore we have to explore its allowable meaning so that there may not be any uncertainty inevitably leading any person to much difficulty in understanding acts prohibited by law so that he may act accordingly It is insisted or emphasised that laws should give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel even an innocent person who ingenuously and undefiledly communicates or associates without any knowledge or having no reason to believe or suspect that the person or class of persons with whom he has communicated or associated is engaged in assisting in any manner terrorists or disruptionists can be arrested and prosecuted by abusing or misusing or misapplying this definition To encapsulate for the discussion above the expressions communication and association deployed in the definition should be qualified so as to save the definition in the sense that actual knowledge or reason to believe on the part of a person to be roped in with the aid of that definition should be read into it instead of reading it down and clause i of the definition a should be read as meaning the communication or association with any person or class of persons with the actual knowledge or having reason to believe that such person or class of persons is engaged in assisting in any manner terrorists or disruptionists so that the object and purpose of that clause may not otherwise be defeated and frustrated Challenging the validity of Section of Act of it has been contended that the power vested under Section on <ORG> to declare by notification any area as terrorist affected area and constitute such area into a single judicial zone or into as many judicial zones as it may deem fit is not only vague but also without any guidance We see some force in the above submission while negativing the contention of the counsel challenging the validity of Section of the Act of Whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances whether biological or otherwise of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause or as is likely to cause death of or injuries to any person or persons or loss of or damage to or destruction of property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act commits a terrorist act Whoever holds any property derived or obtained from commission of any terrorist act or has been acquired through the terrorist funds shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine For the purposes of sub section disruptive activity means any action taken whether by act or by speech or through any other media or in any other manner whatsoever i which questions disrupts or is intended to disrupt whether directly or indirectly the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or ii which is intended to bring about or supports any claim whether directly or indirectly for the cession of any part of India or the secession of any part of India from the <ORG> Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subsection it is hereby declared that any action taken whether by act or by speech or through any other media or in any other manner whatsoever which a advocates advises suggests or incites or predicts prophesies or pronounces or otherwise expresses in such manner as to incite advise suggest or prompt the killing or the destruction of any person bound by oath under the Constitution to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India or any public servant shall be deemed to be a disruptive activity within the meaning of this section Section of the Act of provides Enhanced penalties for a person who with intent to aid any terrorist or disruptionist contravenes any provision of or any rule made under the Arms Act the Explosives Act the Explosive Substances Act or the Inflammable Substances Act of not less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and with fine notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts or the rules made under the respective Acts Section reads For the purposes of this section any person who attempts to contravene or abets or attempts to abet or does any act preparatory to the contravention of any provision of any law rule or order shall be deemed to have contravened that provision and the provisions of subsection shall in relation to such person have effect subject to the modification that the reference to imprisonment for life shall be construed as a reference to imprisonment for ten years The provisions prescribing special procedures aiming at speedy disposal of cases departing from the procedures prescribed under the ordinary procedural law are evidently for the reasons that the prevalent ordinary procedural law was found to be inadequate and not sufficiently effective to deal with the offenders indulging in terrorist and disruptive activities secondly that the incensed offenses are arising out of the activities of the terrorists and disruptionists which disrupt or are intended to disrupt even the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or which may bring about or support any claim for the cession of any part of India or the secession of any part of India from the Union and which create terror and a sense of insecurity in the minds of the people Agreeing with the above view in <NAME> case <NAME> in Niranjan case stated thus SCC para While invoking a criminal statute such as the Act the prosecution is duty bound to show from the record of the case and the documents collected in the course of investigation that facts emerging therefrom prima facie constitute an offence within the letter of the law He should frame a charge if the prosecution shows that the material placed on record and the documents relied on give rise to a strong suspicion of the accused having committed the crime alleged against him Mr <NAME> attacks this provision which provides for forfeiture of property of certain persons convicted by <ORG> of any offence punishable under this Act or any rule made thereunder contending that this section is violative of Articles and on the grounds SCC SCC Cri SCC SCC Cri SCR AIR SC Cri LJ that no guidelines have been provided for when the property of a convicted person should or should not be forfeited and forfeiture to Government free from all encumbrances may amount in many cases to unmerited punishment of third parties who have no concern whatsoever with the offence with which the person under this provision has been convicted and who have got interest by advancing money on the security of the forfeited property This argument is resisted by the learned Additional Solicitor General contending that Section only vests the property or interest of the terrorist in the <ORG> and does not forfeit the third party interest and that the third party can always enforce its rights against the terrorists in respect of its interest in the forfeited property according to law notwithstanding the forfeiture Section of the Act gives discretionary power to <ORG> while awarding any punishment on conviction of an offence under the Act or any rule made thereunder to pass an order in writing declaring that any property whether movable or immovable or both specified in the order belonging to the convicted person shall stand forfeited to the Government free from all encumbrances The discretionary power given to <ORG> under Section and is to be exercised under strict contingencies namely that there must be an order of forfeiture and that order must be in writing the property either movable or immovable or both must belong to the accused convicted of any offence of TADA Act or rule thereunder the property should be specified in the order even though attachment can be made under Section during the trial of the case the forfeiture can be ordered only in case of conviction and not otherwise The very fact that the order should be in writing implies that <ORG> must give reasons for such an order even though the section does not specifically require <ORG> to record its reasons for so doing because the word order even according to the lexicon meaning is that it is a decision or direction either interlocutory or preliminary or final by the court trying the offence Secondly under Section of the Act an appeal lies straight to <ORG> as a matter of right from any order not being interlocutory order both on facts and law We shall now deal with the first contention As we have now found this impugned Act is enacted under Entry of List I the constitution of <ORG> by <ORG> cannot be said to be in violation of Entry of List II which empower <ORG> to constitute the courts It is made clear that the courts constituted by <ORG> either before or after the issue of the notification constituting <ORG> by <ORG> shall have jurisdiction to try any offence committed in that area or areas and <ORG> constituted by <ORG> shall not have any jurisdiction to try any offence committed in that area or areas For the foregoing discussion we see no substance in the contention that Section is violative of Entry List II of the Seventh Schedule and Articles and of the Constitution Sub section deals with the decision to be taken by <ORG> in case of any question of dispute whatsoever with regard to the jurisdiction of <ORG> as earlier pointed out Sub section of Section which speaks of the continuance of the service of the Judge is challenged on the ground that the continuance of a Judge of <ORG> even after attainment of the age of superannuation is a regressive provision because a Judge who is permitted to hold the office hitherto held after superannuation will not be having his judicial independence but on the other hand his holding the office on the pleasure of the executive will be subversive since there is nothing to prevent the executive from terminating his appointment as and when it likes This legal sanction of continuance in the service according to the learned counsel will not serve the purpose of just and fair trial and it would be violating the principle enshrined in Article As we are concerned only with the question of the continuance of a Judge holding the office even on attaining the age of superannuation we are not concerned about the other provisions or clauses of the Special Courts Bill Therefore we see no force in the above argument challenging the constitutional validity of Section by availing the observation in Special Courts Bill In re A serious argument has been advanced in respect of Section of the Act TADA which provides for the transfer of any case pending before one <ORG> in a State to any other <ORG> within that State or to any other <ORG> in any other State He further stated that when cases are transferred en masse from one <ORG> to another <ORG> he will not have any objection but if the concurrence is sought to be obtained in an individual or a particular case then the person to be affected by such transfer must be afforded an opportunity of being heard that if the Government seeks the concurrence to transfer on the request of the accused then there may not be any necessity of issuing notice to the accused and that it depends upon the exigencies of every particular case Mr <NAME> also made his submission in the same line Challenging the constitutional validity of Section He has urged that the <ORG> is fully empowered to exclude the invocation of the rule of natural justice under certain extraordinary circumstances having regard to the fact that the entertainment of any objection would only frustrate the proceeding and paralyse the meaningful purpose of the provision Coming to the other aspect of the argument of Mr <NAME> with reference to Section of the Code the learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon Section of TADA Act which deals with the overriding effect of the provisions of the Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment other than the TADA Act Where the whole or any part of the area within the local limits of the jurisdiction of <ORG> has been declared to be or forms part of any area which has been declared to be a disturbed area under any enactment for the time being in force making provision for the SCC SCC SCC SCC SCR suppression of disorder and restoration and maintenance of public order and <ORG> is of opinion that the situation prevailing in the <ORG> is not conducive to fair impartial or speedy trial within the <ORG> of offenses under this Act or the rules made thereunder which such <ORG> is competent to try <ORG> may with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India specify by notification in the Official Gazette in relation to such court hereafter in this subsection referred to as the local court <ORG> outside the <ORG> hereafter in this section referred to as specified court and thereupon a it shall not be competent at any time during the period of operation of such notification for such local court to exercise any jurisdiction in respect of or try any offence under this Act or the rules made thereunder the jurisdiction which would have been but for the issue of such notification exercisable by such local court in respect of such offenses committed during the period of operation of such notification shall be exercisable by the specified court all cases relating to such offenses pending immediately before the date of issue of such notification before such local court shall stand transferred on that date to the specified court all cases taken cognizance of by or transferred to the specified court under clause or clause shall be dealt with and tried in accordance with this Act whether during the period of operation of such notification or thereafter as if such offenses had been committed within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the specified court or as the case may be transferred for trial to it under sub section The vesting of this power in <NAME> of India is evidently with the purpose of making it known that <ORG> is not seeking to obtain the concurrence either with a motivation of bias or mala fide or on being influenced by any extraneous consideration but on a reasonable and justifiable ground taking into consideration the prerequisite essential conditions those being that the situation prevailing in the State from which a case under Section is sought to be transferred to some other

Public Prosecutor and the judge of the <ORG> or any of them and it is not otherwise in the interests of justice No doubt it is true that there are specific provisions already in vogue under the Constitution and some statutes for transfer of cases and appeals from one court subordinate to the transferring court to another court Section of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers <ORG> to transfer any suit appeal and other proceedings from <ORG> or civil court in one State to <ORG> or other civil court in any other State on the application of a party and after issuing notice and hearing them Though there is no express provision in Article A of the Constitution and in Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the effect that <ORG> before passing any order on the application made or moved for transfer of cases should issue notice and hear the parties as required under Sections and of the Code of Civil Procedure on the principle of audi alteram partem notice is given to the party parties who are likely to be affected by any final order But the question of issuing a notice and hearing the parties may not arise if the order is passed by <ORG> suo motu The according of the concurrence though imperative does not compel the <ORG> to pass any order if for any other intervening causes <ORG> even after obtaining the concurrence decides that there is no necessity of transferring any case Therefore the according of concurrence which is a condition precedent for passing the transfer order by the <ORG> is only a statutory order and not a judicial order because there is no adjudication of any lis and determination of any issue In this connection we may refer to the decision in Cain The consent of the Attorney General as per that provision was accorded in that case which was challenged on the ground that the document of consent from the Attorney General did not constitute sufficient consent for the purpose of Section The contention of Mr <NAME> is that the accused concerned who is likely to be affected by such transfer should be given an opportunity of making his representation in compliance with the principle of natural justice by the Chief Justice of India before be gives his concurrence The questions involved for consideration on the submission made by the learned counsel are answered accordingly A blistering attack was made on the validity of the hotly debated Section as per which the confession made by a person before a police officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police and recorded by such police officer either in writing or on any mechanical device like cassettes tapes or sound tracks shall be admissible in the trial of such person or co accused abettor or conspirator for an offence under this Act or rules made thereunder In this connection he made reference to Section as per which a confession made by a co accused that the accused has committed the offence if proved a presumption shall be drawn by <ORG> that the accused has committed such offence unless the contrary is proved But in dealing with a case against an accused person the court cannot start with the confession of a co accused person it must begin with other evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence then AIR PC IA Cri LJ Periyaswami Mooppan Emperor ILR Mad AIR Mad Cri LJ SCR AIR SC Cri LJ it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to lend assurance to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about to reach on the said other evidence On the dictum laid down in the above decisions he concluded by saying that unreasonableness vitiates not only law but also the procedure alike and therefore it is essential that the procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of his fundamental right must conform to the norms of justice and fair play All the counsel who challenged the validity of the provisions of this Act made similar submissions as that of Mr <NAME> and stated in chorus that Section of the Act gives a death knell to the very basic principle hitherto recognised and followed that a confession made before a

a third party while in police custody is totally inadmissible and that such a confession cannot be proved as against a person accused of any offence Coming to the intrinsic value to be attached to the evidence it has been said by Additional Solicitor General that this section does not lay down the probative value of the confession nor does it indicate that conviction can be based on confession alone made before a police officer Then he drew our attention to certain provisions in various statutes empowering the officers specified therein to secure or arrest the offenders and to record statements from them which statements are held to be admissible in evidence in criminal proceeding as against them by judicial pronouncements of the various <ORG> and this <ORG> Certain confessions made to police officers to be taken into consideration Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or in the Indian Evidence Act but subject to the provisions of this section a confession made by a person before a police officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police and recorded by such police officer either in writing or on any mechanical device like cassettes tapes or sound tracks from out of which sounds or images can be reproduced shall be admissible in the trial of such person or co accused abettor or conspirator for an offence under this Act or rules made thereunder SCR AIR SC Cri LJ Provided that co accused abettor or conspirator is charged and tried in the same case together with the accused The police officer shall before recording any confession under sub section explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and that if he does so it may be used as evidence against him and such police officer shall not record any such confession unless upon questioning the person making it he has reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily Recording of confession made to police officers A confession made by a person before a police officer and recorded by such police officer under Section of the Act shall invariably be recorded in the language in which such confession is made and if that is not practicable in the language used by such police officer for official purposes or in the language of <ORG> and it shall form part of the record It was taken in my presence and hearing and recorded by me and was read over to the person making it and admitted by him to be correct and it contains a full and true account of the statement made by him In our Constitution as well as procedural law and law of Evidence there are certain guarantees protecting the right and liberty of a person in a criminal proceeding and safeguards in making use of any statement made by him Article of the Constitution declares that No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself Article of our Constitution embodies the principle of protection against compulsion of self incrimination which is one of the fundamental canons of the British System of Criminal Jurisprudence and which has been adopted by the American System and incorporated in the Federal Act The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America provides No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury except in cases arising nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself There are a number of outstanding decisions of this Court in explaining the intendment of Article Article and confer certain rights upon a person who has been arrested Coming to the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure Section empowers a police officer making an investigation to examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and to reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of such examination Section which speaks of the use of the statement so recorded states that no statement recorded by a police officer if reduced into writing be signed by the person making it and that the statement shall not be used for any purpose save as provided in the Code and the provisions of the Evidence Act The ban imposed by Section applies to all the statements whether confessional or otherwise made to a police officer by any person whether accused or not during the course of the investigation under Chapter XII of the Code But the statement given by an accused can be used in the manner provided by Section of the Evidence Act in case the accused examines himself as a witness for the defence by availing Section of the Code corresponding to Section A of the old Code and to give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges made against him or any person charged together with him at the same trial There is a clear embargo in making use of this statement of an accused given to a police officer under Section of the Evidence Act according to which no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence and under Section according to which no confession made by any person whilst he is in custody of a police officer unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate shall be proved as against such person Section contemplates that only so much of information whether amounts to confession or not as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered in consequence of that information received from a person accused of any offence while in custody of the police can be proved as against the accused Section of the Evidence Act is to the effect that if a confession made by one or more persons affecting himself and some others jointly tried for the same offence is proved the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other persons as well as the maker of the confession The explanation to the section reads that offence as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence Though in the old Code there was a specific embargo on a police officer recording any statement or confession made to him in the course of an investigation embodied in the main sub section of Section itself in the present Code the legal bar is now brought by a separate proviso to subsection of Section which reads Provided that no confession shall be recorded by a police officer on whom any power of a Magistrate has been conferred under any law for the time being in force Thus an accused or a person accused of any offence is protected by the constitutional provisions as well as the statutory provisions to the extent that no self incriminating statement made by an accused to the police officer while he is in custody could be used against such maker The above constitutional and statutory procedural guarantees and safeguards are in consonance with the expression according to procedure established by law enshrined in Article of the Constitution within which fold the principle of just and fair trial is read into The procedure contemplated by Article is that the procedure must be right just and fair and not arbitrary fanciful or oppressive The principle of legislative classification is an accepted principle where under persons may be classified into groups and such groups may differently be treated if there is a reasonable basis for such difference or distinction Suffice if there is little or no difference between the persons and the things which have been grouped together and those left out of the groups the classification cannot be said to be a reasonable one In making the classification various factors have to be taken into consideration and examined as to whether such a distinction or classification justifies the different treatment and whether they subserve the object sought to be achieved We have already disposed of the question with regard to the competence of the <ORG> and have held in the earlier part of this judgment that the <ORG> has got the legislative competence to enact this law namely the TADA Act and the Special Courts Act of The learned Additional Solicitor General by giving a comparative chart of the provisions of TADA and of the Northern Ireland Emergency Provision Act of wherein there are various provisions akin to some of the provisions of TADA including the mode of trial of scheduled offences specified thereunder in a more stringent manner and the onus of proof in relation to offences corresponding to the provisions of TADA Acts and relating to presumption as to offences under Section and so on contended that the procedure prescribed under this Act for trying the commission of heinous crimes cannot be said to be discriminatory He also made reference to the Prevention of Terrorism Temporary Provision Act UK and some other Acts enacted in India which are now repealed prescribing special procedure and providing severe punishments In the light of the ratio decidendi regarding the legislative competence to enact a law prescribing a special procedure departing from the procedure for trying offenders in the normal circumstances for achieving the object of the Act and the classification of offences and offenders to be tried under separate procedure for the offences specified in the present case under the TADA Act we shall exam ine the rival contentions of the parties and determine whether the procedure prescribed under this Act violates Articles and of the Constitution There is a line of decisions in support of the proposition that the <ORG> is free to make classification of offences and offenders in the application of a statute The exception was upheld because the classification had relation to the purpose for which it was made and <NAME> remarked that it was by practical considerations based on experience rather than by theoretical exigencies that the question of equal protection should be answered The presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment since it must be assumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discriminations are based on adequate grounds The presumption may be rebutted in certain cases by showing that on the face of the statute there is no classification at all and no difference peculiar to any individual or class and not applicable to any other individual or class and yet the law hits only a particular individual or class Keeping the above proposition we have to decide whether the provisions of Section of the Act TADA contravene Article Section of the Act empowered <ORG> by notification in <ORG> to constitute special courts and Section provided that A special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases as the State Government may by general or special order in writing direct It was held by a majority of the <ORG> the learned Chief Justice dissenting that Section was void as it contravened Article <NAME> in his separate judgment while disposing the contention that Section was suffering from unconstitutionality observed There is nothing sacred or sacrosanct about the test of reasonable classification but it has undoubtedly proved to be a useful basis for meeting attacks on laws and official acts on the ground of infringement of the equality principle that part of it with which alone we are concerned in this appeal does offend against Article of the Constitution and is therefore unconstitutional and void <NAME> agreeing with the judgment of <NAME> expressed his view thus SCR AIR SC Cri LJ The present statute suggests no reasonable basis or classification either in respect of offences or in respect of cases As I have said already in the present case the discrimination arises on the terms of the Act itself The fact that it gives unrestrained power to <ORG> to select in any way it likes the particular cases or offences which should go to <ORG> and withdraw in such cases the protection which the accused normally enjoy under the criminal law of the country is on the face of it discriminatory In our considered opinion the classifications have rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the TADA Acts and Special Courts Act and consequently there is no violation of Article of the Constitution In this connection we would like to reproduce the view of <ORG> Fourth Report June with regard to the admissibility of confession made to a police officer as evidence which is to the following effect We are aware that the police are still not totally free from adopting questionable practices while interrogating accused persons but one cannot possibly deny that the greater vigilance now exercised by the public and the press growing awareness of citizens about their individual rights under the law and increasing earnestness and commitment of the senior levels of command in the police structure to put down such malpractice have all tended to reduce the prevalence of such practices in the police to a lesser degree than before After a careful consideration of all aspects of this much debated question we feel that the stage has arrived now for us to take a small positive step towards removing this stigma on the police and make it possible for a confession made before a police officer to enter the area of judicial proceedings if not as substantive evidence at least as a document that could be taken into consideration by the court to aid it in inquiry or trial in the same manner as now provided in regard to case diaries under Section CrPC and the confession of a co accused under Section of the Evidence Act We are also of the view that this approach to the evidentiary admissibility and value of a confession made before a police officer should apply not only to the police but to all persons in authority before whom a confession may be made Whatever may be said for and against the submission with regard to the admissibility of a confession made before a police officer we cannot avoid but saying that we with the years of experience both at the <ORG> and on the Bench have frequently dealt with cases of atrocity and brutality practiced by some overzealous police officers resorting to inhuman barbaric archaic and drastic method of treating the suspects in their anxiety to collect evidence by hook or by crook and wrenching a decision in their favour We are very much distressed and deeply concerned about the oppressive behavior and the most degrading and despicable practice adopted by some of the police officers even though no general and sweeping condemnation can be made having regard to the legal competence of the legislature to make the law prescribing a different mode of proof the meaningful purpose and object of the legislation the gravity of terrorism unleashed by the terrorists and disruptionists endangering not only the sovereignty and integrity of the country but also the normal life of the citizens and the reluctance of even the victims as well as the public in coming forward at the risk of their life to give evidence hold that the impugned section cannot be said to be suffering from any vice of unconstitutionality As the Act now stands after its amendment consequent upon the deletion of Section a confession made by a person before a police officer can be made admissible in the trial of such person not only as against the person but also against the co accused abettor or conspirator provided that the co accused abettor or conspirator is charged and tried in the same case together with the accused namely the maker of the confession proved that the accused had made a confession of the offence to any person other than a police officer <ORG> could raise a presumption that the accused had committed such offence unless the contrary is proved Sub section of Section enjoins a statutory obligation on the part of the police officer recording the confession to explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and to give a statutory warning that if he does so it may be used as evidence against him The net result is that any confession or statement of a person under the TADA Act can be recorded either by a police officer not lower in rank than of a Superintendent of Police in exercise of the powers conferred under Section or by a Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate or Executive Magistrate or Special Executive Magistrate who are empowered to record any confession under Section in view of sub section of Section of the TADA Act However we would like to lay down following guidelines so as to ensure that the confession obtained in the pre indictment interrogation by a police officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police is not tainted with any vice but is in strict conformity with the well recognised and accepted a esthetic principles and fundamental fairness The confession should be recorded in a free atmosphere in the same language in which the person is examined and as narrated by him The person from whom a confession has been recorded under Section of the Act should be produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom the confession is required to be sent under Rule along with the original statement of confession written or recorded on mechanical device without unreasonable delay The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Chief Judicial Magistrate should scrupulously record the statement if any made by the accused so produced and get his signature and in case of any complaint of torture the person should be directed to be produced for medical examination before a Medical Officer not lower in rank than of an Assistant Civil Surgeon Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure no police officer below the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police in the Metropolitan cities and elsewhere of a Deputy Superintendent of Police or a police officer of equivalent rank should investigate any offence punishable under this Act of The police officer if he is seeking the custody of any person for pre indictment or pretrial interrogation from the judicial custody must file an affidavit sworn by him explaining the reason not only for such custody but also for the delay if any in seeking the police custody In case the person taken for interrogation on receipt of the statutory warning that he is not bound to make a confession and that if he does so the said statement may be used against him as evidence asserts his right to silence the police officer must respect his right of assertion without making any compulsion to give a statement of disclosure <ORG> may take note of these guidelines and incorporate them by appropriate amendments in the Act and the Rules Though it is entirely for the court trying the offence to decide the question of admissibility or reliability of a confession in its judicial wisdom strictly adhering to the law it must while so deciding the question should satisfy itself that there was no trap no track and no importune seeking of evidence during the custodial interrogation and all the conditions required are fulfilled States and the incidental questions arising in relation thereto The learned Additional Solicitor General made a detailed argument opposing an attack made against the validity of this provision and relied upon the observation made in <NAME> case to the effect that SCC para The right to a public trial is not one of the guaranteed rights under our Constitution as it is under the th Amendment of the American Constitution which secures to persons charged with crimes a public as well as speedy trial Though the criminal justice prevailing in our country recognises and accepts the practice of only open trial there is an exception to such trial as contemplated under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure falling under Chapter XVIII with caption Trial before a Court of Session which provides an exemption to the general practice Under the General provisions as to enquiries and trials falling under Chapter XXIV there is a specific provision namely Section with a caption Court to be open according to which the inquiry and trial of any offence should be held in an open court to which general public may have access However under the proviso the discretion is given to the presiding Judge or Magistrate to regulate the public generally or any person in particular in having access to or be or remain in the room or building used by the court An exemption is given for the open court trial under Section which is as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section the inquiry into and trial of rape or an offence under Section Section A Section Section or Section of the Indian Penal Code shall be conducted in camera Provided that the presiding judge may if he thinks fit or on an application made by either of the parties allow any particular person to have access to or be or remain in the room or building used by the court By this new substituted sub section now the discretion is given to <ORG> either to hold or not to hold the proceedings in camera In continuation it has been urged that Section and of Act empower <ORG> to take measures for keeping the identity and address of witnesses secret and to issue directions for securing that their identity is not disclosed and that these provisions turn a trial under the provisions of TADA into a farce Before we make a discussion on the intendment of Section and we would like to make reference to the decision in Bimal Kaur wherein an identical question with regard to the identity of the witnesses has been examined by <ORG> of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and was rejected holding that Section cannot be considered to contain a procedure that can be held to be unreasonable unjust or unfair Under the Code of Criminal Procedure whether it is a trial before <ORG> or a trial or warrant cases by Magistrates there are specific provisions prescribing the mode of recording evidence with the right of cross examination of any witness by the accused as contemplated under Sections as well as Sections and of the Code It is the jurisprudence of law that cross examination is an acid test of the truthfulness of the statement made by a witness on oath in examination in chief the objects of which are to destroy or weaken the evidentiary value of the witness of his adversary to elicit facts in favour of the cross examining lawyer client from the mouth of the witness of the adversary party to show that the witness is unworthy of belief by impeaching the credit of the said witness and the questions to be addressed in the course of cross examination are to test his veracity to discover who he is and what is his position in life and to shake his credit by injuring his character There are provisions in some local laws Section of Bombay Police Act the constitutional validity of which has been approved as well as observations of this court in various decisions touching the question under consideration This object would be wholly defeated if a right to confront or cross examine these witnesses was given to the suspect Having regard to the objective which the legislation has in view and the policy underlying it a departure from the ordinary procedure can certainly be justified as the best means of giving effect to the object of the legislature The appellants the students questioned the order on many grounds the chief contention of which was that the rules of natural justice had not been followed before the order was passed since the inquiry had been held behind their back the witnesses who tendered evidence against them were not examined in their presence and there was no opportunity to SCR AIR SC Cri LJ cross examine the witnesses with a view to test their veracity In such cases there is no question of the witnesses being called and the goonda being given an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses Under Section of the Act <ORG> is given only a discretionary authority to keep the identity and address of any witness secret on the following three contingencies On an application made by a witness in any proceedings before it or on an application made by the Public Prosecutor in relation to such witness or on its own motion However when the witnesses are examined in the presence of the accused then the accused may have the chances of knowing the identity of the witnesses if they are already known to the defence But if the witnesses are unknown to the defence then there is no possibility of knowing the identity of the witnesses even after they enter into the witness box During a trial after examination of the witnesses in chief the accused have got a right of deferring the cross examination and calling the witnesses for cross examination on some other day Sub section of that section makes it clear that except as contemplated under sub section of that section no appeal or revision shall lie to any other court One could understand the right of appeal directly to <ORG> under Section of the Act against any judgment pronounced sentence passed or order made by <ORG> solely under the provisions of TADA or under both the provisions of TADA and the ordinary criminal law We see no logic or convincing reasoning in providing no choice but forcing a person aggrieved by the judgment sentence or order of <ORG> passed only under the ordinary criminal law to prefer an appeal to <ORG> directly in which case the aggrieved person has to deny himself firstly the right of appeal to <ORG> and secondly the benefit of approaching <ORG> under Article of the Constitution If every such person aggrieved by the judgment and order of <ORG> passed under any criminal law other than the TADA Act has to approach <ORG> from far flung areas many of the persons suffering from financial constraints may not even think of preferring an appeal at all but to languish in jail indefinitely on that count This predicament and practical difficulty an aggrieved person has to suffer can be avoided if a person who is tried by <ORG> for offences under the TADA Act but convicted only under other penal provisions and is acquitted of the offences under the provisions of TADA Is given the right of preferring an appeal before the next appellate court as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure and if the State prefers an appeal against the acquittal of the offence under the provisions of TADA then it may approach <ORG> for withdrawal of the appeal or revision as the case may be preferred by such person to <ORG> so that both the cases may be heard together We have adverted to the practical difficulties faced by the aggrieved persons under the appeal provisions and how the same can be removed so that <ORG> may take note of them and devise a suitable mode of redress by making the necessary amendments in the appeal provisions Very intense and sharp arguments occasionally filled with emotions were advanced by both the parties with regard to the scope of sub sections and more particularly of sub section of Section of the Act which call for an intense explicit and candid debate and discussion Any Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate may whether or not he has jurisdiction in the case record any confession or statement made to him in the course of an investigation under this Chapter or under any other law for the time being in force or at any time afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial Section of the Code empowers <ORG> to appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates in every district and in every metropolitan area and that one of the Magistrates so appointed should be appointed as District Magistrate This section empowers <ORG> to appoint for such term as it may think fit Executive Magistrates to be known as Special Executive Magistrates for particular areas or for the performance of particular function and confer on such Special Executive Magistrate such of the powers as are conferrable under this Code on Executive Magistrates as it may deem fit Now let us examine the above submission The orders passed by the criminal courts inclusive of the Executive Magistrates are revisable as having been passed in judicial proceedings Besides they also perform statutory functions in their executive capacity Reference may be made to Sections and etc In addition under sub section A of Section of the Code which has been inserted by Act of an Executive Magistrate is also authorised to perform certain judicial functions of authorising the detention of the accused in such custody as he thinks fit for a term not exceeding days in an aggregate for the reasons to be recorded in writing and also releasing the arrestee on bail on the expiry of the period of detention so authorised by him when the police officer making an investigation transmits to the nearest Executive Magistrate conferred with the powers of Judicial Magistrate when the Judicial Magistrate is not available a copy of the entry in the police diary and forwards the accused to AIR Mad Cri LJ such Executive Magistrate It may be noted in this connection that certain legislative changes were made in Section of the old Code corresponding to Section of the new Code by substituting the expression person accused of an offence by Act XVIII of so as to make Section of the Code inapplicable to the security proceedings as well as to proceedings under Sections and of the Code The next question that falls for our consideration is whether the conferment of judicial function to record confessions or statements by the Executive Magistrate is opposed to the fundamental principle of governance contained in Article of the Constitution Under the Criminal Procedure Code powers of judicial Magistrate can be conferred on any person who holds or has held any office under the <ORG> Officers holding various posts under the executive are often vested with the Magisterial powers to meet a particular situation In view of the discussions made above and also in the light of the principles laid down in the various decisions cited above we hold that the Executive Magistrates while exercising their judicial or quasi judicial functions though in a limited way within the frame of the Code of Criminal Procedure which judicial functions are normally performed by Judicial Magistrates can be held to be holding the judicial office Resultantly we hold that sub section of Section of the TADA Act does not offend either Article or Article and hence this sub section does not suffer from any constitutional invalidity Though we are holding that this section is constitutionally valid we in order to remove the apprehension expressed by the learned counsel that the Executive Magistrates and the Special Executive Magistrates who are under the control of the State may not be having judicial integrity and independence as possessed by the Judicial Magistrates and the recording of confessions and statements by those Executive Magistrates may not be free from any possible oblique motive are of the opinion that it would be always desirable and appreciable that a confession or statement of a person is recorded by the Judicial Magistrate whenever the Magistrate is available in preference to the Executive Magistrates unless there is compelling and justifiable reason to get the confession or statement recorded by the Executive or Special Executive Magistrates As per Section the Magistrate is authorised to detain the accused from time to time in such custody as he thinks fit for a term not exceeding fifteen days on the whole but the period of fifteen days now is extended to sixty days and the authorisation of the detention of an accused person otherwise than in the custody of police can be up to ninety days where the investigation relates to an offence punishable with death imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years and sixty days where the investigation relates to any other offence Sub section reads thus Nothing in Section of the Code shall apply in relation to any case involving the arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence punishable under this Act or any rule made thereunder Section of the Code according to him is a most essential safeguard for liberty of a person and that it is found necessary to meet the obvious cases of misuse of police power It is needless to emphasise that both the <ORG> as well as the <ORG> Legislatures have got legislative competence to enact any law relating to the Code of Criminal Procedure In the <ORG> of West Bengal proviso is inserted to Section of the Code to the effect that no final order shall be made on an application filed by the accused praying for anticipatory bail in relation to an offence punishable with death imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than seven years without giving the <ORG> not less than seven days notice to present its case In the <ORG> of Orissa by Section of Orissa Act of a proviso is added to Section stating that no final order shall be made on an application for anticipatory bail without giving the <ORG> notice to present its case for offence punishable with death imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than seven years It is relevant to note one of the reasons given by <ORG> for its suggestions to introduce the provision for anticipatory bail that reason being where there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely to abscond or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail there seems no justification to require him first to submit to custody remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail To put it differently it can be deduced from the reasoning of the Report of <ORG> that where a person accused of a non bailable offence is likely to abscond or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail will have no justification to claim the benefit for anticipatory bail Further at the risk of repetition we may add that Section is a new provision incorporated in the present Code creating a new right In <NAME> there is no specific statement that the removal of Section at any time will amount to violation of Article of the Constitution As the constitutional validity of Section of Act of is attacked on the same ground of sub section of Section of the Act we would like to dispose of a batch of writ petitions filed by several petitions confining the question only with regard to the constitutional validity of Section of the Amendment Act of by which <ORG> has deleted the operation of Section of the Code The questions which arise for consideration are a whether <ORG> has legislative competence to delete Section of the Code and whether the Act of is violative of Articles and of the Constitution Moreover the Amendment Act which has received the assent of the President of India on by virtue of Article of the Constitution prevails in State notwithstanding any prior law made by the <ORG> As the Act is applied throughout the State there is no question of discrimination in the application of this provision in the State of Uttar Pradesh Hence in view of the discussion made in relation to Section of the TADA Act and of the legislative competence of the <ORG> the SCC SCC Cri SCR SCC contention that it is violative of Articles and of the Constitution has no merit and as such has to be rejected The construction of the above sub section which imposes severe limitations on the grant of bail in addition to the limitations contained in Section of the Code has led to a fiery articulation by both the parties As sub section which in term provides that the limitations on granting of bail specified in sub section are in addition to the limitations under the Code or other law for the time being in force on granting of bail serves as a qualifying provision to sub section it has become imperative while interpreting sub section to construe sub section also along with sub section Therefore we would like to reproduce both the sub sections and of Section hereunder Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code no person accused of an offence punishable under this Act or any rule made thereunder shall if in custody be released on bail or on his own bond unless a the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release and where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail Much earlier to the enactment of the Acts of and there was a similar provision namely Rule of the Defence and Internal Security of India Rules for short Rules of with which we are not concerned otherwise It ran as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure of no person accused or convicted of a contravention of these Rules or orders made thereunder shall if in custody be released on bail or his own bond unless a the prosecution has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release and where the prosecution opposes the application and the contravention is of any such provision of these rules or orders mad thereunder as the Central Government or <ORG> may by notified order specify in this behalf the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such contravention Sub section of Section commences with a non obstante clause as in Rule of the Rules of referred to above and in its operation imposes a ban on release on bail of a person accused of any offence punishable under the TADA Act or any rule made thereunder unless the two conditions specified in clauses a and of that sub section are satisfied Mr <NAME> attacks this provision contending that it is the most obnoxious and unfair provision requiring the court to certify that the accused is not likely to commit any offence while on bail The learned Additional Solicitor General attempts to meet the above arguments stating that there is no question of unconstitutionality of the provision and in fact the conditions imposed under clause of sub SCC SCC Cri SCR AIR Punj LR Cri LJ section is in consonance with the requirements prescribed under clauses i and ii of sub section of Section and clause of sub section of that section Sub section which imposes a complete ban on release on bail against the accused of an offence punishable under this Act minimises or dilutes that ban under two conditions those being the Public Prosecutor must be given an opportunity to oppose the bail application for such release and where the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail application the court must be satisfied that the two conditions namely a there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person accused is not guilty of such offence and he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail Section of the Code provides for grant of bail to a person accused of a bailable offence while Section provides for grant of bail to any accused of or suspected of the commission of any non bailable offence However sub section of Section gives discretion to the court to grant bail attached with some conditions if it considers necessary or in the interest of justice Section of the code speaks of bail and Section deals with the special powers of <ORG> or <ORG> regarding bail A <ORG> or <ORG> may direct a that any person accused of an offence and in custody be released on bail and if the offence is of the nature specified in sub section of Section may impose any condition which it considers necessary for the purposes mentioned in that sub section para Though there is no express provision excluding the applicability of Section of the Code similar to the one contained in Section of the Act in relation to a case involving the arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder but that result must by necessary implication follow set aside the order of the arrest rejecting the bail application on the ground that the power conferred by Section is not taken away by Rule as there was no provision in that rule over riding Section But under the TADA Act Section completely excludes the application of Section of the Code These provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure must be read along with Rule and full effect must be given to them except in so far as they are by reason of the non obstante clause overridden by Rule paras Further while it is true that Chapter XXXIII of the Code is still preserved as otherwise <ORG> would have no power to grant bail still the source of power is not Section of the Code but Section being a court other than <ORG> or <ORG> If it were to be held that the power of <ORG> to grant bail was relatable to Section it would imply that not only <ORG> but also <ORG> would be entitled to grant bail on such terms as they deem fit It would run counter to the express prohibition contained in Section of the Act which enjoins that notwithstanding anything in the Code no person accused of an offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder shall if in custody be released on bail unless the conditions set forth in clauses a and are satisfied We must accordingly uphold the view expressed by <ORG> that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an application for bail under Section or under Section of the Code That takes us to the approach which <ORG> has to adopt while granting bail in view of the limitations placed on such power under Section In that case this Court finally set aside the orders passed by various <ORG> and remitted the cases with a direction that the <ORG> should consider each particular case on merit as to whether it fell within the purview of Section and or Section of the TADA of and if so whether the accused in the facts and circumstances of the case were entitled to bail while keeping in view the limitations on the powers of the court under Section of the Act and transfer the other category of cases not falling within the purview of the TADA Act for trial to the ordinary criminal courts The conditions imposed under Section as rightly pointed out by the Additional Solicitor General are in consonance with the conditions prescribed under clauses i and ii of sub section of Section and clause of sub section of that section Similar to the conditions in clause of sub section there are provisions in various other enactments such as Section of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and Section of the Customs Act to the effect that any authorised or empowered officer under the respective Acts if has got reason to believe that any person in India or within the Indian customs waters has been guilty of an offence punishable under the respective Acts may arrest such person Therefore the condition that there are grounds for believing that he is not guilty of an offence which condition in different form is incorporated in other Acts such as clause i of Section of the Code and Section of FERA and of the Customs Act cannot be said to be an unreasonable condition infringing the principle of Article of the Constitution The next nagging question that frequently comes up for our consideration is with regard to the right of a person indicted of an offence under the TADA Act to approach <ORG> for bail under Article of the Constitution of India Some of <ORG>s have taken the view that the jurisdiction of <ORG>s under Article of the Constitution to entertain bail applications and pass orders in cases registered under the provisions of TADA cannot in any way be taken away or whittled down In Usmanbhai one of the questions of substantial importance was as to the jurisdiction and power of <ORG> to grant bail under Section of the Code or by recourse to its inherent powers under Section to a person held in custody accused of an offence under Sections and of the TADA Act of During the course of the discussion one of the questions posed for consideration was whether a bail application can be moved before <ORG> under Article or Article of the Constitution It must necessarily follow that a citizen can always move <ORG> under Article or Article or this Court under Article challenging the constitutional validity of the Act or its provisions on the ground that they SCC Cri Cri LJ Bom Writ Petition Cri No of decided on April SCC Cri offend against Articles and or on the ground that a notification issued by <ORG> or <ORG> under Section of the Act constituting a Designated Court for any area or areas or for such case or class or group of cases as specified in the notification was a fraud on powers and thus constitutionally invalid A careful reading of the above observation makes it clear that it is not the rule laid down by this court on a detailed discussion of the legal provisions but on the other hand it is only the reflection of the opinion of a counsel who appeared in that case as seen from the beginning of the sentence It must necessarily follow Except this passing observation no discussion has been made in the entire judgment We may hasten to add that this can happen only in extreme cases which would be rare and that power of <ORG> is not exercisable in cases like the present where it may be debatable whether the direct accusation made in conjunction with the attendant circumstances if proved to be true is likely to result in conviction for an offence under TADA Act There was thus no justification for <ORG> in the present case to exercise it jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution for examining the merits of the controversy much less for quashing the prosecution of respondent <NAME> in <ORG> for offenses punishable under TADA Act The overriding effect of the provisions of the Act i Section of TADA Act and the Rules made thereunder and the non obstante clause in Section reading Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code clearly postulate that in granting of bail the special provisions alone should be made applicable Therefore we totally agree with the view taken by this Court in <NAME> that if <ORG> is inclined to entertain any application under Article that power should be exercised most sparingly and only in rare and appropriate cases in extreme circumstances However we would like to emphasise and re emphasise that the judicial discipline and comity of courts require that <ORG> should refrain from exercising their jurisdiction in entertaining bail applications in respect of an accused indicted under the special Act since this Court has jurisdiction to interfere and correct the orders of <ORG> under Article of the Constitution Though no oral argument has been advanced by the learned counsel challenging the validity of this provision since we are scrutinising the entire Act we feel that it would be better if our view on this provision is also recorded Section i of Act defines the expression terrorist affected area meaning an area declared as a terrorist affected area under Section and Section of TADA Act of defines notified area meaning such area as the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette specify There is no known method of retaining them but by eternal vigilance There is no institution to which the duty can be delegated except to the judiciary True ours is a country which stands tallest even in troubled times the country that clings to fundamental principles of human rights the country that cherishes its constitutional heritage and rejects simple solutions that compromise the values that lie at the root of our democratic system TO SUM UP The Terrorist Affected Areas Special Courts Act Act of The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act Act of and The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act Act of fall within the legislative competence of <ORG> in view of Article read with Entry of List I and could fall within the ambit of Entry of List I namely Defence of India As the meaning of the word abet as defined under Section i a of Act is vague and imprecise actual knowledge or reason to believe on the part of person to be brought within the definition should be read into that provision instead of reading that provision down The power vested on <ORG> to declare any area as terrorist affected area within the terms of Section of the Act of does not suffer from any invalidity The contention that Sections and of the Act of are liable to be struck down on the grounds that both the sections cover the acts which constitute offenses under ordinary laws and that there is not guiding principle as to when a person is to be prosecuted under these sections is rejected Section of the TADA Act is not violative of Articles and of the Constitution The challenge on the validity of Section on the ground of lack of legislative competence has no merit We uphold sub section of Section of the TADA Act with a suggestion that the Central Government and the State Governments at the time of appointing a Judge or an Additional Judge to <ORG> should keep in mind that the Judge designate has sufficient tenure of service even at the initial stage of appointment so that no one may entertain any grievance for continuance of service of a Judge of <ORG> after attainment of superannuation The order granting concurrence by the Chief Justice of India on a motion moved in that behalf by the Attorney General to transfer any case pending before <ORG> in that State to any other <ORG> within that State or in other State is only a statutory order and not a judicial order since there is no adjudication of any lis and determination of any issue But <ORG> may take note of certain guidelines which we have suggested and incorporate them by appropriate amendments in the Act and the Rules made thereunder The challenge made to Section does not require any consideration in view of the substitution of the newly introduced sub section by Amendment Act of giving discretion to <ORG> either to hold or not to hold the proceedings in camera Sub sections and of Section are not liable to be struck down However in order to ensure the purpose and object of cross examination we uphold the view of the Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in <NAME> holding the identity names and addresses of the witnesses may be disclosed before the trial commences but subject to an exception that the court for weighty reasons in its wisdom may decide not to disclose the identity and addresses of the witnesses especially of potential witnesses whose life may be in danger The existing appeal provisions provided under Section are not constitutionally invalid Likewise clause a of Section of the Special Courts Act does not suffer from any infirmity Section of the TADA Act excluding the application of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure in relation to any case under the Act and the Rules made thereunder cannot be said to have deprived the personal liberty of a person as enshrined in Article of the Constitution The deletion of the application of Section in the State of Uttar Pradesh by Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment does not offend either Article or Article or Article of the Constitution and <ORG> is competent to delete that section which is one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List List III of the Seventh Schedule and such deletion is valid under Article of the Constitution Sub section of Section of TADA Act imposing the ban on release of bail of a person accused of any offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder but diluting the ban only on the fulfillment of the two conditions mentioned in clauses a and of that sub section cannot be said to be infringing the principle adumbrated in Article of the Constitution Though it cannot be said that <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain an application for bail under Article of the Constitution and pass orders either way relating to the cases under the Act that power should be exercised sparingly that too only in rare and appropriate cases in extreme circumstances In the result the legal questions raised and debated are answered accordingly Before parting with this judgment we place on record our uninhibited high appreciation on the valuable and painstaking assistance rendered and cooperation extended by the learned Additional Solicitors General learned Senior Counsel and advocates who by their thorough study of the complicated legal issues involved and by their research and analysis of the historical background with formidable knowledge in constitutional and criminal law have presented their conflicting views on points raised in all the petitions and appeals listed before us Article of the Constitution protects right to life which is the most precious right in a civilised society Our values are drastically eroded because many a man with no more moral backbone than a chocolate eclair claim the freedom and free action which results inevitably in increasing the members of violent criminals However when the police interrogate the suspect they have an opportunity to exploit his moral position and induce the suspect to confess against his better judgment In addition interrogator conveys to the captive that he strongly believes that the captive committed the crime and he has evidence in support of that behalf It was followed by another declaration on December by a convention which provides more elaborate procedure in articles Therefore confession means an admission of certain facts which constitute an offence or substantially all the facts that constitute the offence made by a person charged with the offence which is the subject matter of the statement In <NAME> King Emperor Lord <NAME> held at thus An admission of a gravely incriminating fact even a conclusively incriminating fact is not of itself a confession an admission that the accused is the owner of and was in recent possession of the knife or revolver which caused a death with no explanation of any other man possession A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant if it appears to the court to have been caused by inducement promise or threat having a reference to the charge proceeding from a person in authority By Section there is an absolute ban at the trial against proof of a confession to a police officer as against a person accused of any offence Section makes an exception to Sections and and provides that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of a police officer so much of such information whether it amounts to a confession or not as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved A confession made to a police officer while the accused is in the custody or made before he became an accused is not provable against him on any proceeding in which he is charged to the commission of the said offence Equally a confession made by him while in the custody of the police officer to any person is also not provable in a proceeding in which he is charged with the commission of the offence unless it is made in the immediate IA AIR PC CriU presence of the Magistrate Therefore the confession made to a police officer under Section should totally be excluded from evidence Section rests upon the principle that it is dangerous to depend upon a confession made to a police officer which cannot extricate itself from the suspicion that it might have been produced by the exercise of coercion or by enticement In Chapter of the Code Information by the police and their powers to investigate Section mandates that no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation shall if reduced to writing be signed by the person making it nor shall any such statement or any record thereof whether in a police diary or otherwise or any part of such statement or record be used for any purpose save as hereinafter provided at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the time when such statement was made Under the proviso to sub section it may be used by the accused and with the permission of the court by the prosecution to contradict such witness in the manner provided by Section of the Evidence Act or for the purpose of explaining any matter referred to in the cross examination by reexamining such witness In <NAME> case <ORG> held that any person referred to in Section would include a person who eventually became an accused Any such statement must therefore include such a case and it would appear that if the statement is to be admitted at all it can only be by limiting the words used for any purpose by the addition of such words except as evidence for or against the person making it when accused of an offence Accordingly it was held that the words of Section in their Lordships view plainly are wide enough to exclude any confession made to a police officer in the course of investigation whether a discovery is made or not Section of the Code gives power to the Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate to record confession and statements during the course of investigation under Chapter or under any law for the time being in IA AIR PC CriLJ AIR SC Supp SCR Cri LJ force or at any time afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial But before doing so he is enjoined by sub section thereto to explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and that if he does so it may be used as evidence against him and the Magistrate shall not record any such confession unless upon questioning the person making it he has reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily He shall record the confession in the manner provided in Section for recording the examination of the accused person If he has no jurisdiction to inquire into or try the offence he shall forward the confession so recorded to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be inquired into or tried <ORG> have made rules in this behalf to give sufficient time to the accused for reflection relevant warnings and other related procedural safeguards etc It will have sobering effect on the accused suspect The confession shall be recorded in the manner prescribed under Section and the standing orders and in no other way This is a very important provision which emphasises that the Magistrate in recording confession is exercising part of his judicial function in the manner prescribed by the law A confession duly recorded with the prescribed certificate appended to it may be presumed to be voluntary and be admissible in evidence subject to the conditions contained in Sections to It is not enough for a Magistrate to give the accused a warning that the confession if made would be used against him but it is essential that he should put questions to satisfy himself that the confession was in fact voluntary and the questions with answers must be recorded The court before whom the confession is used must have material AIR SC Cri LJ AIR PC Cri LJ on which it can be satisfied that the confession was in fact voluntary Sufficient time should be given to the accused for reflection but no hard and fast rule could be laid as to the proper time Notwithstanding anything in the Code or in the Indian Evidence Act I of but subject to the provisions of this section a confession made by a person before a police officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police and recorded by such police officer either in writing or on any mechanical device like cassettes tapes or sound tracks from out of which sounds or images can be reproduced shall be admissible in the trial of such person for an offence under this Act or rules made thereunder The police officer shall before recording any confession under sub section explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and that if he does so it may be used as evidence against him and such police officer shall not record any such confession unless upon questioning the person making it he has reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily There cannot be a dispute with the proposition as argued by <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General that the <ORG> when has power to make the Evidence Act has equally power to amend and alter the pre existing procedure in the light of the changing needs of the society and that there is no vested right to procedure We are not concerned so much with the power of the <ORG> to make the law and it does possess such power under Article and Entry of List Under Article of the Constitution no person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself It would be deprived only according to procedure validly established by law Their violation except in accordance with valid procedure established by law are in violation of human right to life assured by Article of the Constitution Yet the substantive as well as the procedural law made modified or amended must be just fair and reasonable The procedure contemplated by Article of the Constitution means just and fair procedure and reasonable law but not formal or fanciful No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law mandated by Article would mean that a person shall not be subjected to coercion which does not admit of legal justification Though the Constitution does not guarantee any particular procedure and the legislature is left free to lay down the procedure Articles and prescribe in built limitation in prescribing the procedure i there must be fundamental fairness in the procedure prescribed by law and should not be unconscionable or oppressive The expression life or personal liberty in Article of the Constitution as stated hereinbefore includes right to live with human dignity which would include guarantee against torture and assault by the State It should be mandatory for the Magistrate to enquire from the arrested person whether he has any complaint of torture or maltreatment in custody and he should further be informed that he has a right under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure to be medically examined When the procedure prescribed by the statute offends the principle of fair justice or established judicial ethos or traditions or shocks the conscience it could be said that it is fundamentally unfair and violative of the fundamental fairness which are essential to the very concept of justice and civilised procedure In Special Courts Bill Re AIR at it was held that the procedure prescribed by the Bill was unjust and unfair to the accused violating Article of the Constitution on the ground that there was no provision in the Bill for the transfer of a case from one special court to another though the presiding judge had a bias The veil of expediency to try the cases by the persons acquainted with the facts and to track the problems posed or to strike down the crime or suppression thereof cannot be regarded as a valid ground to give primacy to the arbitrary or irrational or ultra vires action taken by the Government in appointing the police officers as Special Executive Magistrate nor is the right of revision against his decision a solace At the trial the conversation was testified as incriminating confessional statement made by the defendant which resulted in his conviction They again warned <NAME> and after waiving his rights he made the incriminatory statement This rationale applies when the suspect is reapproached concerning a different offence since there is no basis for concluding that the officers interrogating such offence will lack the eagerness to obtain a confession that this situation poses the high risk to self incrimination interest Section empowers <ORG> or <ORG> to constitute by notification published in <ORG> one or more <ORG> for such area or areas or for such case or class or group of cases as may be specified in the notification Sub section is material for the purpose of this case which reads thus For the removal of doubts it is hereby provided that the attainment of a person appointed as a judge or additional judge of <ORG> of the age of superannuation under the rules applicable to him in the service to which he belongs shall not affect his continuance as such judge or additional judge Under the Code throughout any local area such persons exercise the powers in local area or any other local area to which they are so appointed in addition Under Article subject to the provisions of the Constitution and to the provisions of any law of the appropriate legislature made by virtue of powers conferred on that legislature the jurisdiction of <ORG> would continue to be exercised with the respective powers of the judges thereof in relation to the administration of justice in the <ORG> etc By operation of Article every High <ORG> shall have superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction That apart it also has the power to call for returns from such courts make rules regulating the practice and procedure of such courts etc Other judicial officers other than district judges to the judicial service of a <ORG> shall be made by the Governor in accordance with the rules made by him in that behalf after consultation with <ORG> and with <ORG> as envisaged in Article Article gives control to <ORG> over district courts and courts subordinate thereto including posting and promotion of the officers in the judicial service of the <ORG> The officer exercising judicial power vested in him must be of necessity free to act upon his own conscience and without apprehension of personal consequences to himself or lure of retrial rehabilitation Judicial independence means total liberty of the presiding judge to try hear and decide the cases that have come before him according to the set procedure and decide the cases and give binding decision on merits without fear or favour affection or ill will Judicial review therefore is the process by which the constitutional courts i <ORG> and <ORG> exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings and decisions of the subordinate courts etc Courts have general powers to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between two persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision determination of questions of right in specific cases affecting interests of person or property as distinguished from ministerial power involving no discretion Inherent authority not only to hear and determine controversies between adverse parties but make binding orders or judgments Power to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who bring a case before court for decision The courts have power and authority to declare the law apply the law and give a binding and authoritative decision between the parties before it and carry it into effect Section of the Act provides an appeal to <ORG> from any judgment sentence or order of <ORG> both on facts and under law In <NAME> <NAME> the Criminal Law Special Provisions Act of made by <ORG> contained special procedure for nomination of special judges by the Minister of Justice to try certain offenders or class of offenses which was later amended giving power of nomination to the Chief Justice of <ORG> Power was also given to the police to record confession of those in police custody It was further held that each case has to be decided in the light of its own facts and circumstances including the true purpose of the legislation the situation to which it was directed the existence where several enactments are impugned of a common design and the extent to which the legislation affects by way of direction or restriction the discretion or judgment of the judiciary in specific proceedings Still further it was also held that the true nature and purpose of these enactments are revealed by their conjoint impact on the specific proceedings in respect of which they were designed and they take their color in particular from the alterations they purported to make as to their ultimate objection the AC All ER PC punishment of those convicted It was beset by a grave situation and it took grave measures to deal with it thinking one must presume that it had power to do so and was acting rightly The defendant sought dismissal of the suit on the ground that the Act is unconstitutional offending Article III conferring judicial power upon judges who lacked life tenure and protection against salary diminution The court gave time to the <ORG> to amend the law and the operation of the judgment was postponed till specified date and paras and That is in fact necessary to ensure the independence of every court dealing with civil and criminal matters emphasis supplied Dealing with an argument based on Section of the Code that it was a court under the Code this Court held that A that the section states is that the five classes of criminal courts stated in it shall be in addition to <ORG> and courts that may be constituted under any other law and it cannot be said with any justification that it provides for the constitution of courts parallel to or on the same footing as <ORG> or of criminal courts which are not subordinate <ORG> Moreover Section confers appellate powers on this Court I find considerable force in the contention Yet it being a legislative policy it would be left to the wisdom of the <ORG> to decide and suitably amend the Act keeping in view Article A which itself is a fundamental right to the indigent In paragraph SCC it was held that the cut off date to give effect to the law laid down in the judgment is the date of the judgment In <NAME> <NAME> it was held that though the evidence was collected in illegal search and seizure violating the Fourth Amendment and the conviction based thereon is not valid the decision was held to be prospective and the conviction thereunder was not interfered with It is already seen that in <ORG> case though the establishment of the Bankruptcy <ORG>s was held to be unconstitutional the operation of the judgment was declared prospective and time was given to <ORG> to amend the law without disturbing the judgments already rendered <ORG> has jurisdiction and control over <ORG> or the Magistrate but under the scheme of the Act there is a wall of separation and complete exclusion of the jurisdiction of <ORG> is total From this scenario the question emerges whether <ORG> under Article would be right in entertaining proceedings to quash the charge sheet or to grant bail to a person accused of an offence under the Act or other offenses committed during the course of the same transaction exclusively triable by <ORG> The jurisdiction and power of <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is undoubtedly constituent power and <ORG> has untrammeled powers and jurisdiction to issue any writ or order or direction to any person or authority within its territorial jurisdiction for enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or for any other purpose The legislature has no power to divest the court of the constituent power engrafted under Article The superior court therefore has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction may be rightly or wrongly Therefore the court in an appropriate proceeding may erroneously exercise jurisdiction It may mean that the finding upon which the decision is founded as distinct or it is the operative part or has to be conclusive or these findings bind only parties on litigated disputes or that the organ which has made the decision is itself precluded from revoking rescinding or otherwise altering it In <ORG> Re <NAME> <ORG> the facts were that <ORG> and <ORG> have coordinate jurisdiction over debenture holder of a company carrying on business in the County Palatine of Lancaster When the debenture holder was indicted of an offence of cheating <ORG> and the <ORG> simultaneously had taken cognizance of the offence on a motion <ORG> issued an injunction restraining the plaintiff in the Palatine action while the proceedings in <ORG> had jurisdiction to grant the same injunction <NAME> as he then was exercising the jurisdiction of the <ORG> issued the injunction restraining the plaintiff in the <ORG> from proceeding with the action On appeal <NAME> of <ORG> as he then was held that a man has a right to bring an action in a court of inferior jurisdiction when the circumstances of the case entitle him to do so and if he is within the right he is neither more nor less liable to be restrained from proceeding with an action in a court of coordinate jurisdiction The question of jurisdiction to grant the injunction has nothing to do with the status of the court This is clearly a major factor to be taken into account is deciding whether the <ORG> in its discretion to assume or decline jurisdiction to hear the summons on its merits The object of all procedural rules is to enable justice to be done between the parties consistently with the public interest Appeals in either case lie to the same court On appeal this Court held thus SCC para Now it seems to us past question that when the appellate jurisdiction of superior authority is invoked against an order and that authority is seized of the case it is inconceivable for a subordinate authority to claim to exercise jurisdiction to revise that very order This Court held that where the facts ex facie do constitute an offence or contentious question arises <ORG> does not have power to entertain the proceedings Otherwise it has jurisdiction in ordinary cases This Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of <ORG> holding that the allegations do not fall outside the scope of the Act Thus it could be seen that though <ORG> has jurisdiction and power under Article to issue appropriate writ or direction or order in exceptional cases at the behest of a person accused of an offence triable under the Act or offence jointly triable with the offenses under the Act <ORG> being amenable to appellate jurisdiction and judicial review under Article to this <ORG> and this <ORG> having been statutorily invested with the power and jurisdiction under Section of the Act judicial pragmatism concomitance between this <ORG> and <ORG> the latter must observe comity and self imposed limitation on the exercise of the power under Article and refuse to pass an order or to give direction which would inevitably result in exercising the jurisdiction and power US Ed US Ed US Ed US Ed conferred on this <ORG> under Section of the Act or sitting over the appellate orders passed by this <ORG> Judicial pragmatism therefore poignantly point per force to observe constitutional propriety and comity imposing self discipline to decline to entertain proceedings under Article over the matters covered under Section or the matters in respect of which remedy under Section is available or taken cognizance issue of process or prima facie case in the complaint or charge sheet etc <NAME> To my utter regret but with profound humility to Brother <NAME> for whose erudition and learning of criminal law I have the greatest regard and above all the respect for him as an elder brother I am adding few words more by way of concurring opinion than as an appeal to the brooding spirit of law to the intelligence of a future day as the law which was enacted to tackle extraordinary problem in one or two States now stands extended to many States of the country and the alarming news which appears in press and the shocking instances which have come to notice of this <ORG> require highlighting certain aspects for whatever worth they may be Various provisions of the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act Act of and Act of hereinafter referred to as TADA enacted to make special provision for the prevention of and for coping with terrorists and disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto were assailed not only for infraction of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution but also for being in violation of fair trial the sine qua non of any civilised criminal jurisprudence The attack varied from lack of legislative competence to enact these legislations to vague and wide definitions of expressions such as terrorist activity and abet to constitution of designated courts with persons who could continue even after superannuation thereby reducing its credibility providing arbitrary procedure more to serve political purpose than to secure impartial justice for instance holding of courts in camera non disclosure of names of witnesses recording of confession by police officers presumption of guilt etc and above all harsh provision of punishment with unfettered power to exercise it They claim to be revolutionary heroes yet they commit cowardly acts and lack the heroic qualities of humanity and magnanimity Are these submissions well founded Power to frame or enact law for the governance of the country by the supreme body exercising the sovereign power is known as legislative power In our Constitution the <ORG>s under Article have plenary powers Although the learned Additional Solicitor General attempted to urge that the exercise of power could be traced to Entries and A of List I and it has been accepted by Brother <NAME> but I would confine it to the alternative submission made by the learned counsel that the legislation could be upheld under Entry of List III which is extracted below Criminal law including all matters included in the Indian Penal Code at the commencement of this Constitution but excluding offenses against law with respect to any of the matters specified in List I or List II and excluding the use of naval military or air forces or any other armed forces of the Union in aid of the civil power It is well established that the widest amplitude should be given to the language of the entries The width of the entry however is controlled by the latter expression which takes away the power of either legislature to legislate in respect of offenses against laws with respect to any of the matters specified in List I or List II It further empowers the legislature to make laws not only in respect of matters covered by the Indian Penal Code but any other matter which could reasonably and justifiably be considered to be criminal in nature The <ORG> and <ORG> Legislature both therefore are empowered to legislate in respect of such an activity in exercise of the power conferred under Entry I of the Concurrent List The controversy narrows down to whether the offenses under the TADA are such in respect of which the <ORG> Legislature could make a law One has to imagine three concentric circles Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of <ORG> It is then easy to see that an act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but not security of the <ORG> Can it be said that offenses dealt under TADA relate to public order Is the distinction between public order as visualised in Entry List II and TADA of degree only or are they substantially different Terrorism constitutes a direct repudiation of liberal and human values and principles and that terrorist ideology is and constantly deployed in a struggle to defame and discredit democracy Before embarking upon this exercise it may be worthwhile examining the depth of Article of the Constitution as any law of punitive or preventive detention has to be tested on the touchstone of the constitutional assurance to every person that he shall not be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law No person hall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law Each expression used in this article enhances human dignity and value We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it namely the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition clothing and shelter and facilities for reading writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings This article instead of conferring the right purposely uses negative expression Obviously because the Constitution has recognised the existence of the right in every man It is <ORG> which is restrained from interfering with freedom of life and liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law Since deprivation of right of any person by the <ORG> is prohibited except in accordance with procedure established by law it is to be construed strictly against the <ORG> and in favour of the person whose rights are affected A political party voted to power may adopt repressive measures against its political foes by enacting a law and it may well be said that deprivation being in accordance with procedure established by law it is within the constitutional frame The word except restricts the right of the <ORG> by directing it not to fiddle with this guarantee unless it enacts a law which must withstand the test of Article Today it appears wellnigh settled that procedure established by law extends both to the substantive and procedural law Having analysed the scope of Article and traced its history judicially and legislatively it is proposed to take up few provisions of Act as I have nothing to add to what has been said by Brother <NAME> on Act and Act with which I respectfully agree Where any person is in possession of any arms and ammunition specified in Columns and of Category or Category III a of Schedule to the Arms Rules or bombs dynamite or other explosive substances unauthorisedly in a notified area he shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine but he uses the arms and ammunitions which results in death or is likely to cause death and damage to property etc The definition of the crime as has been discussed earlier is contained in Sections and of the Act and it is true that while defining the crime it is open to the legislature to make provision which may serve the objective of the legislation and from a wider point of view one may say that possession of such arms the use of which may lead to terrorist activity should be taken as one of the offenses as a preventive or deterrent provision Even under Ireland Emergency Provisions Act on which great reliance was placed by learned Additional Solicitor General there is no such harsh provision like Section Since both the substantive and procedural law apply to a terrorist and disruptionist or a terrorist act or a disruptive act it is necessary in my opinion that this section if it has to be immune from attack of arbitrariness may be invoked only if there is some material to show that the person who was possessed of the arms intended it to be used for terrorist or disruptionist activity or it was an arm and ammunition which in fact was used Yet is <ORG> going to say for ever and ever that this will be the only country in the world where a confession to a high police officer whatever the safeguards will be an untrustworthy statement Are we going to live with that kind of a slur What we are trying to do is for a period of two years in an extraordinary situation dealing only with one kind of offence namely terrorist offenses we say that a confession made to a high police officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police and above under very restricted conditions will be admissible in a court of law There is a basic difference between the approach of a police officer and a judicial officer By Section a confession made to a police officer is deemed to be inadmissible ipso facto A confession made to a police officer is suspect even in England and America But it has been made admissible subject to the safeguards mentioned above Further a confession made to a police officer for an offence committed irrespective of its nature in non notified area is inadmissible How the methods applied by police in extracting confession has been deprecated by this Court in series of decisions need not reproduced This has resulted in our view in large numbers of wholly innocent persons being arrested and large numbers whose involvement in terrorist activities is relatively unimportant being detained Terrorism and Criminal Justice by <NAME> The person making it states something against himself therefore it should be made in surroundings which are free from suspicion Otherwise it violates the constitutional guarantee under Article that no person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself No civilised democratic country has accepted confession made by an accused before a police officer as voluntary and above suspicion therefore admissible in evidence The mere fact that the <ORG> was competent to make the law as the offence under TADA is one which did not fall in any <ORG> entry did not mean that the <ORG> was empowered to curtail or erode a person of his fundamental rights Making a provision which has the effect of forcing a person to admit his guilt amounts to denial of the liberty The difference in nature of offence or the legislative competence to enact a law did not affect the fundamental rights guaranteed by Chapter III Section provides for an appeal as a matter of right from any judgment sentence or order not being an interlocutory order of <ORG> to <ORG> both on facts and law I would therefore suggest that it may be examined if a proviso to sub section of Section can be added that a person convicted of any offence other than Sections and of the Act shall be entitled to file an appeal in the High <ORG> under whose jurisdiction <ORG> is situated Coming to sub section of Section one of the issues debated was if a person accused of an offence under the TADA was entitled to invoke extraordinary jurisdiction of <ORG> either for quashing of the proceedings as on facts no offence was made out and the proceedings were invoked as an abuse of process of court or for extraneous reason and whether the order rejecting the bail by <ORG> could be subjected to judicial review under Article It was urged that as far back as <NAME> <NAME> it having been observed by this Court that power of superintendence conferred by Article was to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds and their authority and not in correcting errors The power given to <ORG> under Article is an extraordinary power not only to correct the manifest error but also to exercise it for sake of justice But the few on which there can be hardly any dispute are if the <ORG> is of opinion that the proceedings under TADA were an abuse of process of court or taken for extraneous considerations or there was no material on record that a case under TADA was made out If it be so then there is no reason why should the <ORG> not exercise its jurisdiction and grant bail to the accused in those cases where one or the other exceptional ground is made out As regards provisions of appeal I have suggested that it may be examined by the appropriate authority if a proviso could be added to Section that where convictions are for offenses other than Sections and of Act of the accused may be entitled to file an appeal in <ORG> itself and in case an appeal against conviction is filed by the Government in this Court then the appeal filed by the accused in <ORG> should stand automatically transferred As regards jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain an application for bail under Article of the Constitution I am of the opinion that <ORG>s being constitutionally obliged to ensure that any authority which exercises judicial and quasi judicial powers in its jurisdiction functions within the framework of law are entitled to entertain the petition to determine if the proceedings were not an abuse of process of court
