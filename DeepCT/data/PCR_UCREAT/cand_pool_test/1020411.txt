The suit which has given rise to this appeal was brought by the plaintiff a Mahomedan lady against the defendant her father in law to recover arrears of certain allowance called Kharch i pandan under the terms of an agreement executed by him on the th October prior to and in consideration of her marriage with his son <NAME> both she and her future husband being minors at the time The husband and wife lived together until when owing to differences she left her husband home and has since resided more or less continuously at Moradabad I that the plaintiff was no party to the agreement and was consequently not entitled to maintain the action and that she had forfeited her right to the allowance thereunder by her misconduct and refusal to live with her husband The plaintiff thereupon appealed to <ORG> where the argument seems to have been confined solely to the question of the plaintiff right to maintain the action as the learned Judges observe that neither side called their attention to the evidence on the record They hold that she had a clear right to sue under the agreement and they accordingly reversed the order of the first <ORG> and decreed the plaintiff claim First it is contended on the authority of Tweddle <NAME> that as the plaintiff was no party to the agreement she cannot take advantage of its provisions Here the agreement executed by the defendant specifically charges immoveable property for the allowance which he binds himself to pay to the plaintiff she is the only person beneficially entitled under it It has however been urged with some force that the allowance for which the defendant made himself liable signifies money paid to a wife when she lives with her husband that it is analogous in its nature to the English pin money over the application of which the husband has a control and that as the plaintiff has left her husband home and refused to live with him she has forfeited her right to it By the agreement on which the present suit is based the defendant binds himself unreservedly to pay to the plaintiff the fixed allowance there is no condition that it should be paid only whilst the wife is living in the husband home or that his liability should cease whatever the circumstances under which she happens to leave it The plaintiff was closely related to the ruler of the native state of Rampur and the defendant executed the agreement in order to make a suitable provision for a lady of her position Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal be dismissed
