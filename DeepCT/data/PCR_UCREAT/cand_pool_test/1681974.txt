This appeal arises out of a suit for redemption instituted by respondent on th July to redeem a usufructuary mortgage in favour of the appellant executed by respondent <NAME> on th June As originally framed the suit was a suit for redemption based on the simple ground that mortgage money had become payable and there should be a redemption The learned Subordinate Judge decreed the suit on both the grounds though the learned <NAME> had decreed the suit on the first ground alone There was a default in payment of the instalments due to <NAME> on st July and he brought a suit for recovery of the entire money due to him on st July and obtained a decree on th March In the appellate Court it was urged on behalf of <NAME> that the nonpayment of the instalment of by <NAME> amounted to a breach of contract and that this fact entitled <NAME> to sue for redemption before the expiry of the terms With this rule of law in our mind if we read the document in question we shall see without difficulty that there was only one term and that was for both the parties The translation that had been supplied to us reads as follows Whereas I have taken a loan of Rs and have made a usufructuary mortgage for a term of ten years The agreement is that when I the mortgagor do pay to the mortgagee within ten years the entire mortgage money cash and in a lump sum then the property mortgaged will stand redeemed Again we have got the following sentence Hence I have executed this usufructuary mortgage deed by conditional sale of ten years that it may serve as evidence when necessary There are two other terms which are material At two places already quoted we have got the expressions that the term of the mortgage was ten years but as against these two clauses there is the clause which says that the mortgagor would be entitled to redeem the property if he paid within ten years It has been argued that the mortgagor must be allowed to redeem within the term of ten years as under the actual terms of the mortgage he will otherwise have no opportunity to pay A mortgagee by conditional sale is not entitled to become the owner of the property without a suit for foreclosure and it is always open to a mortgagor to pay up and avoid foreclosure at any time before there is a final decree for foreclosure Therefore whenever there is a mortgage by conditional sale and there is a term fixed for the mortgage the condition stipulated is bound to be in the language of the present document that the mortgagor would be entitled to redeem the property within a specified number of years If there is no payment the mortgagee would be entitled to sue for foreclosure It is always a profitless task to attempt to read one document in the light of another and we will simply content ourselves with quoting the cases As regards the point that there has been a breach of contract on the part of the appellant and therefore there should be a redemption in spite of the non expiry of the term of the mortgage this was purely a question of fact and no pleadings were there in the Court of first instance on the point and there was no issue One point is clear namely <NAME> never had an opportunity to pay off the decree passed in favour of <NAME> It has been conceded before us that <NAME> contested <NAME> right to bring his suit owing to the default but in spite of his contest <NAME> lost and a decree was made against him as also against <NAME> on rd March If he had failed to pay it might have been said that he committed a breach of the contract In the circumstances we do not see how there was a breach of contract In the result we allow the appeal set aside the decrees of the <ORG> below and dismiss the suit of respondent <NAME> with costs throughout
