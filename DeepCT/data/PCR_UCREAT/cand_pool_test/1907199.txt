Both these appeals by special leave arise out of a judgment rendered by <ORG> in Reference No of and Criminal Appeal No of Both the appeals arise from the same judgment and were therefore heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment The occurrence which gave rise to the present appeals took place on th August a little after <NAME> according to prosecution who was fatally injured in this occurrence had a few days prior to th August earned a prize in the amount of Rs He found <NAME> injured lying on the ground and he inquired from <NAME> as to what had happened whereupon <NAME> told him that <NAME> Hawker doing business near <ORG> injured him with a knife and at that time <NAME> son of Nathu of Girth Sakna and <NAME> brother of <NAME> were with him and they beat him and information should be given to his relatives Information given by accused No while in custody led to the recovery of blood stained knife Ext He was arrested and the information given by him while in custody led to the recovery of a ring and a watch pledged with one <NAME> on st August The defence of accused No <NAME> was that he caused injury to <NAME> in exercise of the right of private defence of body in that when he was peeling apple for his wife who was then pregnant deceased <NAME> accompanied by <NAME> and one <NAME> alias Pashi came over there and started beating him He also accepted the circumstantial evidence in the form of recovery of blood stained knife Ext He also accepted the evidence about the injuries found on the person of accused No <NAME> and accused No <NAME> and along with the recovery of button Ext and concluded that there was good deal of struggle at the spot where <NAME> was found lying injured He also convicted accused Nos and for an offence under Section read with Section I The sentence awarded to accused No was submitted to <ORG> for confirmation Therefore the suggestion that the death would be instantaneous and there was no chance for the deceased to make dying declaration has been rightly negatived It must at once be noticed that in this case there is no witness to the occurrence in the sense that no one has spoken to his having seen the accused causing injuries to deceased <NAME> Evidence of <NAME> widow of the deceased would show that she was awakened by <NAME> and she was given information about the unfortunate occurrence Both the learned Sessions Judge and <ORG> observed the correct principle for appreciating the evidence furnished by a dying declaration and both have recorded an affirmative conclusion that the dying declaration as deposed to by <NAME> was inherently true voluntary and reliable Scanning it it becomes clear that it speaks of accused No <NAME> causing injuries to <NAME> and it speaks of the presence of accused No <NAME> and No <NAME> There was some Controversy about one word Shamel is used in the dying declaration and it was urged on the one hand that it means participation in the assault and on the other hand it was stated that it may at best suggest presence As we are left on the question of participation of accused Nos and only on the dying declaration of the deceased as the other evidence offered for corroboration of the same does not appeal to us and when the language of the dying declaration is open to two interpretations and as <ORG> has accepted that latter interpretation favourable to accused Nos and on the material as it is it would not be proper to take another view of the matter If there was some other evidence directly suggesting involvement of accused Nos and in the attack on the deceased it would have provided corroboration to the interpretation as was canvassed on behalf of the State but in the absence of such evidence it is not possible to accept the suggested interpretation of the dying declaration and base the conviction of accused Nos and solely on the same It was next contended that accused No <NAME> was not traced till he surrendered to the Judicial Magistrate First Class Pathankoton th August and he was brought to Kangra on There is a long delay between the date of occurrence and the arrest of <NAME> and recovery Of course <NAME> is examined and he said that the aforementioned two articles were pledged by <NAME> with him for a loan of Rs However even if this evidence of recovery is believed it would not establish participation of accused No <NAME> in the assault because he may have got these articles even from <NAME> who is alleged to be the assailant of the deceased Therefore there is no material evidence in this case which would corroborate dying declaration so far as assuced No is concerned There is no other evidence in the form of recovery of any incriminating article from accused No or recovery on the information given by him and therefore there is no corroboration to the dying declaration so far as accused No is concerned He found the following injuries on the person of accused No Similarly he found the following injuries on the person of accused No In this connection we must also take note of the version of accused Nos and He said that he was attacked and beaten and he abused them loudly and then ran out of his verandah He said that he felt great suffocation and he used his hands to escape and there was knife in one of his hands He said that he had no intention to kill him but he was anxious to save himself <NAME> stated that he got the injuries when <NAME> alias Pashi came to his shop and beat him accusing him It would thus appear that <ORG> was perfectly justified in acquitting accused Nos and and there is no reason to take another view of the matter and the appeal preferred by the <ORG> against the acquittal of accused Nos and must fail Mr <NAME> who appeared for accused No urged that accused No should be acquitted because he had caused injuries in exercise of the right of private defence of body Evidence furnished by the dying declaration corroborated by the recovery of blood stained clothes from the person of accused No <NAME> further corroborated by the recovery of a blood stained knife on the information given by him would affirmatively establish that accused No attacked deceased and caused him four injuries In this connection we must refer to some facts which unquestionably emerge from the evidence This would raise the question as to what value should be attached to the statement made by the accused under Section Cr In order to give an opportunity to the accused to explain the circumstances appearing against him in evidence the <ORG> under Section Cr There was at one point of time some controversy whether the statement of the accused can be accepted in part and rejected in part This situation arose where a part of the statement was inculpatory and a part of the statement was exculpatory In <NAME> case there was no eye witness to the commission of the crime and the evidence was all circumstantial and the statement of the accused that he was present at the scene of the crime was a vital circumstance which taken in conjunction with other circumstances led the Court to come to the conclusion that he was guilty of the crime imputed to him On the facts of the case after accepting a part of the statement of the accused it was held that he caused injuries in exercise of the right of self defence but he exceeded the same It was observed that it is permissible for the Court to rely on a portion of the statement of the accused and find him guilty in consideration of the other evidence against him led by the prosecution Where the commencement or genesis of the occurrence is not available because there was no witness to the occurrence available the only direct version of the commencement of the occurrence would be found in the statement of the accused if he chooses to give out his version of the occurrence His statement has to be considered in the light of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and weighing his statement with the probabilities of the case either in his favour or against him In this case the direct testimony if it can be so styled is furnished by the dying declaration which speaks of who caused injuries to the deceased and who others were present According to him he was the victim of an assault and he was felled on the ground and in his attempt to get a release from the grip of <NAME> he caused injuries to him by a knife which was accidentally in his hand Therefore just before the occurrence in which <NAME> received injuries there was an incident involving <NAME> alias <NAME> and accused Ho The next aspect which we must bear in mind is that the site plan shows that there were marks of scuffle and buttons torn out of the bush shirt were found lying there and a torn bush shirt of <NAME> was recovered The very evidence indicates that a little before the occurrence there was mutual recrimination between <NAME> and <NAME> and for that there is direct evidence of <NAME> He has caused four injuries one of which is necessarily fatal The proper legal and reasonable inference to be drawn from all the circumstances is that because of the earlier incident in which <NAME> and <NAME> were involved something like a challenge was taken up and <NAME> definitely accompanied by some others more presumably <NAME> came over to the house of accused No and there was a mutual free fight between the parties Accused No had returned to his house probably a little before the incident took place
