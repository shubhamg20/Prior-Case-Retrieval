These appeals are directed against a judgment and order dated passed by a Division Bench of <ORG> at Madras whereby and whereunder several writ appeals filed by the Appellants herein and writ petitions filed by the Private Respondents were disposed of The Act and the Rules came into force with effect from With a view to condone the serious lapses on the part of the Cooperative Societies in making such appointments in illegal and arbitrary manner <ORG> issued various orders from time to time in terms whereof such appointments were sought to be regularised fixing a cut off date therefor Ultimately by Ms No dated the cut off date was extended upto and thereby the Government of Tamil Nadu sought to regularise appointments made after in the Cooperative Societies without notifying <ORG> in respect of those employees who had completed days of service in two years purported to be in terms of Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen Act for short the Act Issue No was also decided in favour of the writ petitioners holding that the Act is applicable to the employees of <ORG> <ORG> by reason of the impugned judgment opined that the provisions of the Act would not be applicable as regard appointments made in violation of the statute or statutory rules <ORG> held i that <ORG> <ORG> dated has got the effect of only authorizing the regularization of the employees recruited by the cooperative societies for the period from to exempting the intervention of employment exchange ii that <ORG> <ORG> dated shall not operate for regularization of any employee recruited by the cooperative societies in violation of Sub Rule of Rule of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Rules as amended by <ORG> <ORG> dated iii in societies where the cadre strength has not been fixed direct them to adopt the special bye law in conformity with sub Rule of Rule of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Rules as amended by GOMs No Cooperation Food and Consumer Protection Department dated iv direct the Registrar of Cooperative Societies to issue a circular within a week from today calling upon all the cooperative societies in the State of Tamil Nadu to comply with the direction in clause iii supra direct that within two months of the approval of the special bye laws under sub rule of the Rule of the Rules the respective Deputy Registrars of Cooperative Societies having jurisdiction over the cooperative societies in their Divisions shall enquire by issuing notice to the entire staff recruited from to and decide as to whether the said recruitment is in conformity with the special bye laws approved by <NAME> and terminate the services of such staff members whose appointments are in contravention of the special bye laws so approved by <NAME> It is made clear that while considering the validity or otherwise of the appointment of the staff cooperative societies the requirement of notifying the vacancies to employment exchange shall not be taken cognizance of vii that either the provisions of Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen Act or the Industrial Disputes Act or the settlements entered under Sections or thereof shall have no application to the staff of the cooperative societies appointed without adequate qualifications or beyond the cadre strength for the period from to Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant relying on or on the basis of the decision of this Court in <NAME> and Others Vs <ORG> SCC would submit that having regard to the fact that the appellants had been working in the cooperative societies for a long time <ORG> committed a serious error in not holding that they had acquired a right for regularization The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents on the other hand supported the judgment of <ORG> The primal question which arises for consideration in these appeals is as to whether the <ORG> had the requisite authority to direct regularisation of services of the employees of the cooperative societies by reason of the impugned GOMs No dated Section of the Act provides for power of the <ORG> to exempt registered societies from any of the provisions of the Act other than clause of sub section of section and sub section of section of this Act or of the rules subject to such conditions as may be specified and direct that such provisions of the rules shall apply to such society with such modifications as may be specified in the order It is not the case of any of the parties that any such order of exemption had been passed in favour of any of the cooperative societies Section of the Act therefore does not confer any power upon the <ORG> to issue the impugned order Power of Government to give directions In any case in which a direction has been given under sub section the Government may notwithstanding anything contained in this Act call for and examine the record of the proceedings of the Registrar and pass such orders in the case as they may think fit Provided that before passing any order under this sub section the person likely to be affected by such order shall be given an opportunity of making his representation Article of the Constitution of India provides for extension of executive power to the matters with respect of which <ORG> has power to make laws Article of the Constitution by no stretch of imagination is attracted as the source of the power of the State to pass an appropriate order must be traced to the provisions of the Act itself If the State had no power to issue the said GOMs No dated the same must be held to be a nullity The cooperative societies are obligated to follow the cooperative principles as laid down in the Act and the Rules framed thereunder The <ORG> had framed rules in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section of the Act in the year At this juncture we may notice some of the provisions contained in Rule of the Rules Sub rule of Rule mandates that no person shall be appointed to the service of a society if he has on the date on which he joins the post attained the age of thirty years and in the case of persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes thirty five years It is also now well settled that an appointment made in violation of the mandatory provisions of the Statute and in particular ignoring the minimum educational qualification and other essential qualification would be wholly illegal The question came up for consideration before this Court as far back in in State of Mysore Anr Vs Narayanappa SCR wherein this Court observed Before we proceed to consider the construction placed by <ORG> on the provisions of the said order we may mention that in <ORG> both the parties appear to have proceeded on an assumption that regularisation meant permanence Ratification or regularisation is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the authority but there has been some non compliance with procedure or manner which does not go to the root of the appointment To accede to such a proposition would be to introduce a new head of appointment in defiance of rules or it may have the effect of setting at naught the rules No regularisation is thus permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Article of the Constitution if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory Rules In State of and Another Vs Dharam Bir SCC it was observed that the government services are essentially a matter of status rather a contract and in that context it was observed Whether a person holds a particular post in a substantive capacity or is only temporary or ad hoc is a question which directly relates to his status Unless therefore there is a provision in the statutory rules for alteration of status in a particular situation it is not open to any government employee to claim a status different than that which was conferred upon him at the initial or any subsequent stage of service Applying these principles to the instant case since the respondent admittedly was appointed in an ad hoc capacity he would continue to hold the post in question in that capacity It is trite that appointments cannot be made on political considerations and in violation of the government directions for reduction of establishment expenditure or a prohibition on the filling up of vacant posts or creating new posts including regularization of daily waged employees See <ORG> Vs <NAME> and Others SCC Yet again in <NAME> and Others Vs State of Assam and Others SCC it was noticed The decisions cited by Mr <NAME> in support of his contention not only do not support his contention but on the other hand appears to us to be against his contention In Dr <NAME> Mrs Vs State of Rajasthan SCC this Court categorically held that there was no scope of regularization unless the appointment was made on a regular basis In State of Haryana and Another Vs <NAME> and Others SCC a Division Bench of this Court held that a person appointed as daily wager holds no post and thus not entitled to claim the benefit of equal pay for equal work Directions cannot be given to regularise their services in the absence of any existing vacancies nor can directions be given to the <ORG> to create posts in a non existent establishment The other equally injurious effect of indiscriminate regularization has been that many of the agencies have stopped undertaking casual or temporary works though they are urgent and essential for fear that if those who are employed on such works are required to be continued for or more days have to be absorbed as regular employees although the works are time bound and there is no need of the workmen beyond the completion of the works undertaken Although we do not intend to express any opinion as to whether the cooperative society is a <ORG> within the meaning of Article of the Constitution of India but it is beyond any cavil of doubt that the writ petition will be maintainable when the action of the cooperative society is violative of mandatory statutory provisions and Others SCC <ORG> of this Court rejected a similar contention stating The learned counsel therefore contends that there is every justification for absorbing the respondents concerned on regular basis in recognition of their long satisfactory service The contention of the learned counsel cannot be sustained for more than one reason and we find no valid grounds to grant the relief of regularization There is nothing on record to show that the employees concerned were appointed after following due procedure for selection In Jacob Puthuparambil supra whereupon Mr <NAME> placed strong reliance a Judge Bench of this Court noticed that by reason of the statutory rules regularization was sought to be made of such employees who were appointed under posts required to be filled if i it is necessary in public interest and ii where an emergency has arisen to fill any particular post which has fallen vacant immediately In Civil Appeal No of an additional ground has been raised to the effect that as the appellant was appointed on a compassionate ground this Court on sympathetic consideration should issue appropriate directions directing the respondents to regularize her services In <ORG> Vs <ORG> Chandigarh and Others SCC it is stated We have no doubt in our mind that sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right JT SC this Court rejected a similar plea for regularization of services stating We repeatedly asked the learned counsel for the appellants on what basis or foundation in law the appellants made their claim for regularization and under what rules their recruitment was made so as to govern their service conditions For the reasons aforementioned we do not find any merit in these appeals which are dismissed accordingly
