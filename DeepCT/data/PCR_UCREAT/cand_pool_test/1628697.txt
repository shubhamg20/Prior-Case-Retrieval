These petitions raise a common question and may conveniently be decided by a common judgment Under the aforesaid Act the Excise Commissioner is the Controller of Molasses who exercises full power over the production sale preservation and price of molasses Certain other prayers have been made in these petitions but since no argument was addressed in support thereof they need not be set out here It was urged that since excise duty is essentially a tax on production and manufacture of excisable goods no duty could be levied in respect of goods manufactured and produced during the period when excise duty was not leviable The demands made by the respondents are illegal We find no merit in the contention Laws are to be found which impose a duty on excise at stages subsequent to the manufacture or production Rule of the Central Excise rules provides that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufactures or any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in the rules or as the Collector may require It clearly provides that payment of duty shall not be required in respect of excisable goods made in a factory until they are about to be issued out of the place or premises specified under Rule or are about to be removed from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under Rule These rules leave no room for doubt that excise duty is leviable not with reference to the date of manufacture of the excisable goods but at the time and at the rate on the date of removal of goods from the place of manufacture or from the approved place of storage Thus the duty is linked in point of a time to the date of removal and not to the date of manufacture No advantage can therefore be taken of the exemption granted under the aforesaid notification which has ceased to cover molasses now The petitions are accordingly dismissed with costs
