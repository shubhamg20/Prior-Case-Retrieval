That section reads thus Where there are numerous parties having the same interest in one suit one or more of such parties may with the permission of the <ORG> sue or be sued or may defend in such suit on behalf of all parties so interested but the <ORG> shall in such case give at the plaintiff expense notice of the institution of such suit to all such parties either by personal service or if from the number of parties or any other cause such service is not reasonably practicable then by public advertisement as the <ORG> in each case may direct It appears to me that the provisions of the section would be unintelligible unless the word received that meaning The section appears to be taken from Rule Order XVI of the rules and orders made under the provisions of the Supreme <ORG> of Judicature Act That rule says Where there are numerous parties having the same interest in one action one or more of such parties may sue or be sued or may be authorised by the <ORG> to defend in such action on behalf or for the benefit of all parties so interested The result of this rule was to give legislative sanction to the practice which had long obtained in the <ORG> of Chancery but there is this distinction between the rule and Section the former contains no provision requiring the permission of the <ORG> nor any provision as to notice decided by <ORG> of this Court and though I am not prepared to say that I should consider every judgment of <ORG> binding upon me when sitting on the Original Side yet every such judgment should receive respectful consideration and careful attention and should be followed unless I am very clearly of opinion that the conclusion arrived at is an erroneous one It may be quite possible that if these plaintiffs had applied to the <ORG> under the provisions of Section they would have obtained permission to institute this suit but not having obtained that permission they certainly were not entitled to institute this suit I have now to consider what I ought to do whether to dismiss the suit or to yield to Mr <NAME> application to grant permission for its institution nunc pro tunc and to adjourn the hearing until the requisite notices have been given I am anxious not to dismiss the suit after so much expense has been incurred but I do not think I have the power to grant permission at this stage
