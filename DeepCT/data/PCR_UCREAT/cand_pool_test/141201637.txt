In regard to acquisition of the lands of respondents under notifications dated and issued under section and section of Land Acquisition Act Act for short the LAO had made an award offering a compensation of Rs per acre which was increased to Rs per acre by <ORG> and to Rs per acre by <ORG> This Court also observed that since the appeals were old <ORG> will have to take steps to dispose the appeals expeditiously The respondents thereafter filed a writ petition No They also sought a direction to the appellant to pay mesne profits and damages with interest after adjusting the amount under the award already made from the date of taking possession till date of issuance of fresh notification under Section of the Act The respondents thereafter filed two applications for amendment of prayers seeking a direction for determination of market value as on the date of final award after a fresh notification and not with reference to the notification dated The grievance of the petitioners is that possession over the land of the petitioners has been taken over by the respondents authority without authority of law This Court had directed to settle the matter outside the Court Emphasis supplied In compliance with the said order an affidavit was filed on behalf of Principal Secretary <NAME> explaining that as the District Magistrate and the Commissioner had arrived at the rate on the basis of sale deed dated by ignoring the fact that the notification under Section of the Land Acquisition Act had been issued on the said reports were not accepted by the Government It was also stated that the State Government has taken a decision to pay compensation for the land at the rate of Rs per acre with solatium and interest in all Rs and that had been communicated to the Respondents Thereafter the appellant filed an affidavit dated submitting that the matter was re examined and found that the recommendations of District Magistrate as well as of Commissioner were not binding on State Government that this Court in <NAME> Vs State of Haryana has held that a writ petition challenging the notifications under Section and of the Land Acquisition Act was not maintainable after lapse of several years and that therefore the writ petition was liable to be dismissed List this case for further orders hearing on The copy of this order be sent to the Principal Secretary <ORG> and Principal Secretary Revenue Govt Aggrieved by the said order dated directing the Principal Secretary Finance and Principal Secretary Revenue of the Government of to appear in person and the direction to show cause as to why interest at the rate of per annum shall not be charged and the same be recovered from their personal salary to the extent of each on the payments allegedly delayed by them the <ORG> has filed this appeal by special leave raising the following questions a Whether <ORG> while hearing a writ petition challenging a land acquisition can force <ORG> to settle the matter outside the Court Whether <ORG> was justified in calling the senior officers of the state government and directing them to settle the matter when the writ petition filed by Respondents is being resisted by the state government by contending that the writ petition itself was not maintainable as it purported to challenge the land acquisition proceedings years after the issuance of notifications under Sections and of the Act and years after taking of the possession Whether <ORG> was justified in repeatedly directing the senior officers of the rank of Secretaries to Government to be present in court when the state government refused to settle the matter and pressurize them to settle the disputed claim by threatening to recover the entire interest from their salaries As on date there is no order either in the appeal or the writ petition determining any amount other than what was awarded by <ORG> as due to the respondents As both the writ petition and the appeals are pending it cannot be said that there is any delay on the part of the state government or its officers in effecting payment of compensation It is a matter of concern that there is a growing trend among a few Judges of <ORG> to routinely and frequently require the presence in court of senior officers of the government and local and other authorities including officers of the level of Secretaries for perceived non compliance with its suggestions or to seek insignificant clarifications It can issue to any person or authority or government directions orders writs for enforcement of fundamental rights or for any other purpose But there are well settled norms and procedures for exercise of such power Such trust and confidence should not be frittered away by unnecessary and unwarranted show or exercise of power Greater the power greater should be the responsibility in exercising such power It became necessary as we have noticed that the learned Presiding Judge of the Bench has been frequently making such orders directing senior officers of the Government to be present and settle claims It is a coincidence that another case where a similar procedure was adopted by the learned Presiding Judge of the bench came up before us today <ORG> Nainital vs <NAME> CA No of decided on We have no doubt that the learned Judge bona fide believes that by requiring the presence of senior officers he could expedite matters and render effective justice There is no doubt that <ORG> has power to summon these officials but in our opinion that should be done in very rare and exceptional cases when there are compelling circumstances to do so We therefore set aside the impugned order of <ORG> and request <ORG> to dispose of the pending appeal expeditiously on merits All questions are left open
