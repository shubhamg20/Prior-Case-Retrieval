Central Excises Salt Act Rules made under Rule giving power to <ORG> to exempt excisable goods from duty Exemptions under Notifications dated july and April whether apply only to goods produced by a cooperative society for itself and not for others Taxing statutes interpretation of Relevance of object of giving exemption from duty HEADNOTE The appellant who was a dealer in textiles in Bombay entered into an agreement with a registered cooperative society for weaving yarn supplied by him into cotton fabrics on powerlooms owned by its members The <ORG> had obtained licence as required by the Central Excises and Salt Act A subsequent notification dated April granted exemption to cotton fabrics produced on powerlooms owned by any Cooperative <ORG> or owned by or allotted to the members of the <ORG> which is registered on or before March The excise authorities did not accept the claim for exemption and in a writ petition filed by the appellant <ORG> gave only partial relief In appeal before this Court the question was whether the exemption granted under the notifications in question could be claimed only when the cotton fabrics were manufactured by a Cooperative <ORG> for itself HELD On a true construction of the language of the notifications dated July and April it is clear that all that is required for claiming exemption is that the cotton fabrics must be produced on powerlooms owned by the Cooperative <ORG> There is no further requirement under the two notifications that the cotton fabrics must be produced by the cooperative society on powerlooms for itself It is well established that in a taxing statute there is no room for any intendment but regard must be had to the dear meaning of words Applying this principle the case of the appellant was covered by the language of the two notifications and the appellant was entitled to exemption from excise duty for the cotton fabrics Appeal from the judgment and order dated July of <ORG> in Special Civil Application No of <NAME> This appeal is brought by certificate from the judgment of <ORG> dated July in Special Civil Application No of By letters dated August and October <ORG> had granted exemption from excise duty payable on cotton fabrics manufactured by the <ORG> under the notification issued by <ORG> On January the Superintendent of Central Excise <NAME> sent another notice to show cause why penalty should not be imposed upon the appellant for contravention of rule and why duty should not be charged for the cotton fabrics so removed by the appellant The appellant showed cause and on November the Assistant Collector of <ORG> Surat held that the appellant was liable to pay excise duty to The appellant preferred an appeal to the Collector of <ORG> but the appeal was dismissed <ORG> dismissed the writ petition by its judgment dated July but gave a direction that the respondent was to work out the excise duty on the footing that the appellant was entitled to exemption from duty altogether in respect of goods supplied for the period from June to September Section which is the charging section provides for the levy and collection of duties specified in the First Schedule on all excisable goods which are produced or manufactured in India Clause of rule provides that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed Clause of that rule provides that if any excisable goods are in contravention of sub rule deposited in or removed from any place specified therein the producer or manufacturer thereof shall pay the duty leviable on such goods upon written demand made by the proper officer and shall also be liable to a penalty which may extend to two thousand rupees and such goods shall be liable to confiscation that the case fell within the language of the two notifications dated July and April and the appellant was entitled to exemption from payment of excise duty on the cotton fabrics The notification dated July grants exemption to cotton fabrics produced by any Co operative <ORG> formed of owners of cotton powerlooms which is registered or which may be registered on or before March subject to four conditions set out in the notification In the next notification dated April exemption was granted to cotton fabrics produced on powerlooms owned by any cooperative society or owned by or allotted to the members of the society which is registered or which may be registered on or before March subject to the conditions specified in the notification It was contended on behalf of the appellant that under the contract between the appellant and the <ORG> there was no relationship of master and servant but But even on the assumption that the appellant had manufactured the goods by employing hired labour and was therefore a manufacturer still the appellant was entitled to exemption from excise duty since the case fell within the language of the two notifications dated July and April and the cotton fabrics were produced on power looms owned by the co operative society and there is nothing in the notifications to suggest that the cotton fabrics should be produced by <ORG> for itself and not for a third party before it was entitled to claim exemption from excise duty It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the object of granting exemption was to encourage the formation of co operative societies which not only produced cotton fabrics but which also consisted of members not only owning but having actually operated not more than four power looms during the three years immediately preceding their having joined the society We are unable to accept the contention put forward on behalf of the respondents as correct On a true construction of the language of the notifications dated July and April it is clear that all that is There is no further requirement under the two notifications that the cotton fabrics must be produced by the Co operative <ORG> on the powerlooms for itself It is well established that in a taxing statute there is no room for any intendment but regard must be had to the clear meaning of the words In this connection we may refer to the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Co Intentlon of the legislature is a common but very slippery phrase which popularly understood may signify anything from intention embodied in positive enactment to speculative opinion as to what the legislature probably would have meant although there has been an omission to enact it Applying this principle we are of opinion that the case of the appellant is covered by the language of the two notifications dated July and April and the appellant is entitled to exemption from excise duty for the cotton fabrics produced for the period between October to April and from May to January This appeal is accordingly allowed with costs
