HEADNOTE A law or order which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the executive in the matter of regulating trade or business in normally available commodities must be held to be unreasonable Under cl of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order the licensing authority has been given absolute power to grant or refuse to grant renew or refuse to renew suspend revoke cancel or modify any licence under this Order and the only thing he has to do is to record reasons for the action he takes Not only so the power could be exercised by any person to whom the State Coal Controller may choose to delegate the same and the choice can be made in favour of any and every person Such provisions cannot be held to be reasonable Held therefore that the provision of cl of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order must be held to be void as imposing an unreasonable restriction upon the freedom of trade and business guaranteed under art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an application presented by the petitioners under article of the Constitution complaining of infraction of their fundamental rights guaranteed under article and clauses and of article of the Constitution and praying for enforcement of the same by issue of writs in the nature of mandamus The petitioners are a firm of traders who had prior to the cancellation of their licenee been carrying on the business of retail sellers of coal at a coal depot held by them in the town of Kanpur The landed costs comprised several items and besides ex colliery price the middleman commission and the railway freight there were incidental expenses of various kinds including labour duty loading and unloading charges cartage and stacking expenses There was an application for ad interim stay in connection with this petition which came up for hearing before the learned Vacation Judge of this court on the Ist of July On that day an undertaking was given by the State of Uttar Pradesh to the effect that they would withdraw the order of the th February and apparently the consideration that weighed with the State in giving this undertaking was that it was a purely executive order without any legislative sanction behind it The order of the th February was in fact withdrawn but on the th of July the State of Uttar Pradesh promulgated by a notification an order intituled The Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order purporting to act in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section of the Essential Supplies Act read with the notified order of <ORG> issued under section of the Act In this Order unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context <ORG> means the District Magistrate of the District or any other officer authorised by him to perform his functions under this Order and includes the District Supply Officer of the district No person shall stock sell store for sale or utilise coal for burning bricks or shall otherwise dispose of coal in this State except under a licence in Form A or granted under this Order or in accordance with the provisions of this Order The State Coal Controller may by written order likewise require any person holding stock of coal to sell the whole or any part of the stock to such person or class of persons and on such terms and prices as may be determined in accordance with the provisions of clause No licensee in Form and no person acting on his behalf shall sell agree to sell or offer for sale coal at a price exceeding the price to be declared by <ORG> in accordance with the formula given in Schedule III A licensee in Form A or any other person holding stock of coal or any other person acting for or on behalf of such licensees or person transferring or disposing of such stocks to any person in accordance with clause or clause shall not charge for the coal a price exceeding the landed cost plus incidental and handling charges plus an amount not exceeding per cent of the landed cost as may be determined by <ORG> or the State Coal Controller The District Magistrate shall within a week of the commencement of this Order prepare and publish in a local paper a list of persons carrying on the business of sale of coal in his district and upon the publication of the list the persons included therein will be deemed for purposes of this Order to be licensee until three months next following the publication of the list in Form A or as may be specified If any person contravenes any of the provisions of this Order or the conditions of licenee granted thereunder he shall be punishable under section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both and without prejudice to any other punishment to which he may be liable In accordance with the provision of clause of the Control Order set out above the petitioners name appeared in the list of licence holders and they did apply for a licence in the proper form as required by clause The charges mainly were that there were two other depots held and financed by the petitioners themselves in the names of different persons and that the petitioners had entered into agreements for sale of coal at more than the fixed rates In the present petition the petitioners have challenged the validity of the Coal Control Order of the th of July the declaration of prices made on the th of July following and also the order cancelling the petitioners licence on the th of October It is argued that these provisions imposing as they do unreasonable restrictions upon the right of the petitioners to carry on their trade and business conflict with their fundamental rights under article of the Constitution and are hence void All that is necessary is that these provisions should not infringe the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution and if they impose restrictions upon the carrying on of trade or business they must be reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the general public as laid down in article of the Constitution The power of granting or withholding licences or of fixing the prices of the goods would necessarily have to be vested in certain public officers or bodies and they would certainly have to be left with some amount of discretion in these matters So far no exception can be taken but the mischief arises when the power conferred on such officers is an arbitrary power unregulated by any rule or principle and it is left entirely to the discretion of particular persons to do anything they like without any check or control by any higher authority A law or order which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the executive in the matter of regulating trade or business in normally available commodities cannot but be held to be unreasonable Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under It is in the light of these principles that we would proceed to examine the provisions of this control Order the validity of Which has been impugned before us on behalf of the petitioners There are two exceptions engrafted upon this general rule the first is laid down in sub clause a and to that no objection has been or can be taken The Second exception which is embodied in subclause has been objected to by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners This exception provides that nothing in clause shall apply to any person or class of persons exempted from any provision of the above sub clause by the State Coal Controller to the extent of such exemption An unrestricted power has been given to the State Controller to make exemptions and even if he acts arbitrarily or from improper motives there is no check over it and no way of obtaining redress We agree however with Mr <NAME> that this portion of the Control Order even though bad is severable from the rest and we are not really concerned with the validity or otherwise of this provision in the present case as no action taken under it is the subject matter of any complaint before us The more formidable objection has been taken on behalf of the petitioners against clause of the Control Order which relates to the granting and refusing of licences The licensing authority has been given absolute power to grant or refuse to grant renew or refuse to renew suspend revoke cancel or modify any licenee under this Order and the only thing he has to do is to record reasons for the action he takes Not only so the power could be exercised by any person to whom the State Coal Controller may choose to delegate the same and the choice can be made in favour of any and every person Practically the Order commits to the unrestrained will of a single individual the power to grant withhold or cancel licences in any way he chooses and there is nothing in the Order which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon injustice that might result from improper execution of the same This safeguard in our opinion is hardly effective for there is no higher authority prescribed in the Order who could examine the propriety of these reasons and revise or review the decision of the subordinate officer It was pointed out and with perfect propriety by Mr Justice <NAME> in the well known American case of <NAME> Hopkins that the action or non action of officers placed in such position may proceed from emmity or prejudice from partisan zeal or animosity from favouritism and Other improper influences and motives which are easy of concealment and difficult to be detected and exposed and consequently the injustice capable of being wrought under cover of such unrestricted power becomes apparent to every man without the necessity of detailed investigation As this provision forms an integral part of the entire structure of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order the order cannot operate properly unless the provision of clause is brought in conformity with the constitutional requirements indicated above Clause empowers the State Coal Controller to direct by written order any person holding stock of coal to sell the whole or any part of the stock to such person or class of persons and on such terms and prices as may be determined in accordance with the provision of clause Clause provides that no licensee in Form shall sell or agree to sell coal at a price exceeding the price to be declared by the licensing authority in accordance with the formula given in Schedule III With regard to items and of the Schedule the actual costs are taken into account and to that no objection can possibly be taken The discretion given to the licensing authority in fixing these rates is however not an unlimited discretion but has got to be exercised with reference to the condition prevalent in the locality with which the local officers must be presumed to be familiar It is pointed out that at Lucknow Aligarh Allahabad and other places much higher rates were allowed though the local conditions of these places are almost identical and there has been consequently a discrimination in this respect which makes the declaration void altogether It is certainly not open to us to substitute our own determination in tile matter of fixing the prices for that of the licensing authority and provided we are satisfied that the discretion that has been vested in a public officer is not an uncontrolled discretion and no unfair discrimination has resulted from the exercise of it we cannot possibly strike down as illegal any order or declaration made by such officer Schedule III fixes the profit at per cent upon the landed costs with the exception of item No and as this is not the maximum it would have to be allowed in all cases and under clause the licensees are to sell their stocks of coal according to the prices fixed under Schedule III We make no order as to costs
