The remaining appeals arise from separate judgments dated January March and April and in one of them the common judgment and order dated May was followed Vide public notices issued under sub section of Section of the Land Acquisition Act for short the Act on November and February notifying for general information that the land mentioned in the schedule appended thereto was needed for the said public purpose On December a declaration was made under Section of the Act that the land mentioned in the schedule including the subject land was needed for public purpose namely for the construction of residential colony under a planned development scheme By the said notification the Collector Gorakhpur was also directed that on expiration of days from the publication of the notice under Section the possession of the land mentioned in the schedule may be taken although no award under Section has been made The present appellants and the other tenure holders whose land was sought to be acquired pursuant to the aforesaid notifications approached <ORG> by filing writ petitions wherein inter alia a plea was raised that there was no justification to invoke urgency clause and there was no material before the <ORG> for dispensing with the enquiry under Section A of the Act Be it noticed here that prior to the issuance of the notifications dated November February under Section read with Sections and of the Act somewhere in the month of February <ORG> was constituted to identify the availability of land for a housing colony in or around Gorakhpur He would submit that the <ORG> <ORG> has adopted a policy of pick and choose inasmuch as some land has been released from acquisition while the appellants land has not been considered for being released Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh as well as Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the <ORG> justified the impugned notifications and submitted that <ORG> has acted within its competence and power in invoking urgency clause and dispensation of enquiry under Section A for the public purpose viz They submitted that there is no impediment for <ORG> in invoking urgency clause for the public purpose of housing On behalf of the <ORG> it was contended that many steps have been taken in developing the land acquired under the impugned notifications inasmuch as water line electric line sewerage line drainage etc Learned senior counsel and counsel for the parties cited some decisions of this <ORG> in support of their respective submissions Before we advert to the aforesaid question it is appropriate that we briefly notice the relevant provisions contained in the Act The Act was enacted for the acquisition of land needed for public purposes and for companies and for determining the amount of compensation to be made on such acquisition Section makes a provision for publication of preliminary notification notifying that land mentioned therein is needed for a public purpose Section A confers a right on the person interested in any land which has been notified under Section as being needed for a public purpose or likely to be needed for public purpose to object to the acquisition of the land The declaration made under Section is conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose and after making such declaration the appropriate government may acquire the land in the manner provided in subsequent provisions Section provides a public notice to be given by the Collector stating that the government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land may be made to him As per Section the Collector is required to enquire into the objections that may be received from the persons interested pursuant to the notice issued under Section and determine the award of compensation inter alia by enquiring into the value of the land and the respective interests of the persons claiming compensation Section provides for taking possession of the land after the Collector has made an award under Section The special powers in cases of urgency and unforeseen emergency are conferred upon the government under Section Sub section thereof provides that in case of urgency the appropriate government may direct the Collector to take possession of any land needed for public purpose on expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in Section although no award has been made Sub section confers power on the appropriate government to acquire the immediate possession of the land for the purposes specified thereunder in the cases of unforeseen emergency Sub section empowers the government to direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply on its satisfaction that the provisions contained in sub section or sub section are applicable and a declaration may be made under Section after the publication of the notification under Section Insofar as Uttar Pradesh is concerned sub section A has been inserted after sub section of Section which provides that the power to take possession under sub section may also be exercised inter alia if the land is required for planned development Section gives liberty to the government to withdraw from acquisition of any land this Court observed that the opinion of the government formed under Section of the Act can be challenged as ultra vires SCR in a court of law if it could be shown that the government never applied its mind to the matter or that the action of the government is mala fide while considering the urgency provision contained in Section this Court held that merely because there was some laxity at an earlier stage it cannot be inferred that on the date the notification was issued there was no urgency It was held that the conclusion of the government in a given case that there was urgency is entitled to weight if not conclusive Indeed questions relating to validity of the notification on the ground of mala fides do not seem to us to be ordinarily open in a summary enquiry under Section A of the Act Now the purpose of Section of the Act is obviously not merely to confine action under it to waste and arable land but also to situations in which an inquiry under Section A will serve no useful purpose or for some overriding reason it should be dispensed with The mind of the officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section A which has to be considered Section deals with a case in which an enquiry under Section A of the Act could not possibly serve any useful purpose It results in more or less indicating by an operation of natural physical forces beyond human control what land should be urgently taken possession of This in itself on the face of it does not call for any such action barring exceptional circumstances as to make immediate possession without holding even a summary enquiry under Section A of the Act imperative On the other hand such schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable at least summary inquiries under Section A of the Act to be completed without any impediment whatsoever to the execution of the scheme Therefore the very statement of the public purpose for which the land was to be acquired indicated the absence of such urgency on the apparent facts of the case as to require the elimination of an enquiry under Section A of the Act Again the uniform and set recital of a formula like a ritual or mantra apparently applied mechanically to every case itself indicated that the mind of the Commissioner concerned was only applied to the question whether the land was waste or arable and whether its acquisition is urgently needed All schemes relating to development of industrial and residential areas must be urgent in the context of the country need for increased production and more residential accommodation Yet the very nature of such schemes of development does not appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary enquiries under Section A of the Act There is no indication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> that the mind of the Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act The recitals in the notifications on the other hand indicate that elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act was treated as an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other matters The recital does not say at all that any opinion was formed on the need to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act The burden therefore rested upon the <ORG> to remove the defect if possible by evidence to show that some exceptional circumstances which necessitated the elimination of an enquiry under Section A of the Act and that the mind of the Commissioner was applied to this essential question It seems to us that <ORG> correctly applied the provisions of Section of the Evidence Act to place the burden upon the <ORG> to prove those special circumstances although it also appears to us that <ORG> was not quite correct in stating its view in such a manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial burden of the petitioners under Sections and of the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the <ORG> to discharge its duty under Section of the Act The correct way of putting it would have been to say that the failure of the <ORG> to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under Section of the Evidence Act taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances including the contents of recitals had enabled the petitioners to discharge their burden under Sections and of the Evidence Act It was further observed that save in real urgency where public interest does not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not having regard to Articles and burke an enquiry under Section of the Act a three Judge Bench of this Court was concerned with the challenge to the notification issued under Sections and of the Act for the public purpose viz this <ORG> was concerned with the question of urgency in acquisition of large tract of land by <ORG> for its housing scheme with the object of providing housing accommodation to the residents of Meerut city The notification under Section read with Section and was published in <ORG> on July and the declaration under Section of the Act was issued on May It was next contended that in the large extent of land acquired which was about acres there were some buildings here and there and so the acquisition of those parts of the land on which buildings were situated was unjustified since those portions were not either waste or arable lands which could be dealt with under Section of the Act We do not however find any substance in it In such a situation where there is real urgency it would be difficult to apply Section A of the Act in the case of few bits of land on which some structures are standing and to exempt the rest of the property from its application It is not necessary in this case to consider any further the legality or the propriety of the application of Section of the Act to such portions of land proposed to be acquired on which super structures were standing because of the special provision which is inserted as sub section A of Section of the Act by the Land Acquisition Amendment Act which reads thus A The power to take possession under sub section may also be exercised in the case of land other than waste or arable land where the land is acquired for or in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind or planned development It is no doubt true that in the notification issued under Section of the Act while exempting the application of Section A of the Act to the proceedings the State Government had stated that the land in question was arable land and it had not specifically referred to sub section A of Section of the Act under which it could take possession of land other than waste and arable land by applying the urgency clause We do not therefore find any substance in the above contention While dealing with the provisions contained in Sections and and of Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act the provisions being pari materia to the provisions of the Act this Court held that the satisfaction under Section is a subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the <ORG> could have formed the said satisfaction fairly the Court would not interfere nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority This Court noticed that in view of the time bound programme stipulated by the lender <ORG> and a large number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying SCC out the said work having already been appointed the satisfaction of the State <ORG> that holding an enquiry under Section A would result in uncalled for delay endangering the entire scheme and time schedule of <ORG> could not be faulted Dealing with a challenge to the opinion of urgency formed by the appropriate government and its satisfaction to eliminate the enquiry under Section A this Court observed that the opinion of the government is entitled to great weight unless it is vitiated by mala fides or colourable exercise of power The question therefore is whether invocation of urgency clause under Section dispensing with inquiry under Section A is arbitrary or is unwarranted for providing housing construction for the poor The pre notification and post notification delay caused by the officer concerned does not create a cause to hold that there is no urgency In that case a three Judge Bench of this <ORG> had upheld the notification issued under Section even though lapse of time of years had occurred due to inter departmental discussions before receiving the notification It was further held that delay on the part of the lethargic officials to take further action in the matter of acquisition was not sufficient to nullify the urgency which existed at the time of the issuance of the notification and to hold that there was never any urgency Conclusion of the Government that there was urgency though not conclusive is entitled to create weight In <NAME> case this <ORG> had held that very often persons interested in the land proposed to be acquired may make representations to the authorities concerned against the proposed writ petition that is bound to result in multiplicity of enquiries communications and discussions leading invariably to delay in the execution of even urgent projects It was emphasised that The mind of the officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section A which has to be considered Very often the officials due to apathy in implementation of the policy and programmes of the <ORG> themselves adopt dilatory tactics to create cause for the owner of the land to challenge the validity or legality of the exercise of the power to defeat the urgency existing on the date of taking decision under Section to dispense with Section A inquiry It is true that there was pre notification and post notification delay on the part of the officers to finalise and publish the notification So long as the problem is not solved and the need is not fulfilled the urgency continues to subsist The argument on behalf of the appellants therein was that there was no relevant material with the appropriate government to enable it to arrive at its subjective satisfaction about dispensing with the enquiry under Section A in connection with the subject SCC SCC acquisition and there was delay of more than one year in issuance of declaration under Section after issuance and publication of notification under Section read with Section of the Act This Court observed Even that apart if that was the urgency suggested by <ORG> on we fail to appreciate as to how the State authorities did not respond to that proposal equally urgently and why they issued notification under Section read with Section after one year in January If the urgency was of such a nature that it could not brook the delay on account of Section A proceedings it is difficult to appreciate as to why Section notification in the present case could be issued only after one year from the issuance of Section notification This also shows that according to the State authorities there was no real urgency underlying dispensing with Section A inquiry despite <ORG> suggesting at the top of its voice about the need for urgently acquiring the lands for the development of Sector and other sectors Section as noticed above provides that in cases where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there exists an urgency or unforeseen emergency as required under sub section or of Section it may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if such direction is given then Section A inquiry can be dispensed with and a declaration may be made under Section on publication of Section notification and possession can be made A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows that mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a condition precedent for invoking Section that by itself is not sufficient to direct the dispensation of the Section A inquiry It requires an opinion to be formed by the <ORG> concerned that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for SCC dispensing with Section A inquiry which indicates that the legislature intended the appropriate <ORG> to apply its mind before dispensing with Section A inquiry But then that is not the language of the section which in our opinion requires the appropriate <ORG> to further consider the need for dispensing with Section A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency This understanding of ours as to the requirement of an application of mind by the appropriate <ORG> while dispensing with Section A inquiry does not mean that in each and every case when there is an urgency contemplated under Section and unforeseen emergency contemplated under Section exists that by itself would not contain the need for dispensing with Section A inquiry It is possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate <ORG> under Section or the unforeseen emergency under Section itself may be of such degree that it could require the appropriate <ORG> on that very basis to dispense with the inquiry under Section A but then there is a need for application of mind by the appropriate <ORG> that such an urgency for dispensation of the Section A inquiry is inherent in the two types of urgencies contemplated under Sections and of the Act An argument was sought to be advanced on behalf of the appellants that once the appropriate Government comes to the conclusion that there is an urgency or unforeseen emergency under Sections and the dispensation with inquiry under Section A becomes automatic and the same can be done by a composite order meaning thereby that there is no need for the appropriate Government to separately apply its mind for any further emergency for dispensation with an inquiry under Section A We are unable to agree with the above argument because sub section of Section itself indicates that the Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply emphasis supplied which makes it clear that not in every case where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there is urgency and under sub section or unforeseen emergency under sub section of Section the Government will ipso facto have to direct the dispensation of the inquiry SCR wherein considering the language of Section of the Act which was then referable to waste or arable land and the Amendment to the said section this Court held thus It will be seen that Section gives power to the Government to direct the Collector though no award has been made under Section to take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purpose and such land thereupon vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances If action is taken under Section taking possession and vesting which are provided in Section after the award under Section are accelerated and can take place fifteen days after the publication of the notice under Section Then comes Section which provides that in case of any land to which the provisions of sub section are applicable the Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the notification under Section It will be seen that it is not necessary even where the Government makes a direction under Section that it should also make a direction under Section If the Government makes a direction only under Section the procedure under Section A would still have to be followed before a notification under Section is issued though after that procedure has been followed and a notification under Section is issued the Collector gets the power to take possession of the land after the notice under Section without waiting for the award and on such taking possession the land shall vest absolutely in Government free from all encumbrances It is only when the Government also makes a declaration under Section that it becomes unnecessary to take action under Section A and make a report thereunder It may be that generally where an order is made under Section an order under Section is also passed but in law it is not necessary that this should be so It will also be seen that under the Land Acquisition Act an order under Section or Section can only be passed with respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with respect to land which is not waste or arable and on which buildings stand At this stage it is relevant to notice that the limited right given to an owner person interested under Section A of the Act to object to the acquisition proceedings is not an empty formality and is a substantive right which can be taken away for good and valid reason and within the limitations prescribed under Section of the Act The legislature has therefore made complete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections It is clear from the above observation of this Court that right of representation and hearing contemplated under Section A of the Act is a very valuable right of a person whose property is sought to be acquired and he should have appropriate and reasonable opportunity of persuading the authorities concerned that the acquisition of the property belonging to that person should not be made This Court emphasized that failure to take timely action for acquisition by the authorities cannot be a ground to SCC invoke the urgency clause to the serious detriment to the right of the land owner to raise objections to the acquisition under Section A It was further observed that the Act is an expropriatory legislation and therefore its provisions should be strictly construed as it deprives a person of his land without consent posited that Section of the Act confers extraordinary powers on the authorities under which it can dispense with the normal procedure laid down under Section A of the Act in cases of exceptional urgency and that such powers cannot be lightly SCC SCC resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the government to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose After referring to few decisions of this Court particularly <NAME> and <NAME> it was observed that these decisions assign a great deal of importance to the right of a citizen to file objections under Section A of the Act and the fact that such right was elevated to the status of a fundamental right is in itself sufficient to indicate that great care had to be taken by the SCC authorities before resorting to Section of the Act and they have to satisfy themselves that there was an urgency of such nature which could brook no delay whatsoever While considering as to whether the <ORG> was justified in doing away with the inquiry under Section A it must be noted that there are no allegations of mala fides against the authority In the present case we have seen the judgment of <ORG> which has gone into the records and has recorded categorical finding that there was sufficient material before <ORG> and <ORG> has objectively considered the issue of urgency Even before this <ORG> there were no allegations of mala fides We therefore reject the SCC argument that there was no urgency to justify dispensation of Section A inquiry by applying the urgency clause Eminent domain is right or power of a sovereign State to appropriate the private property within the territorial sovereignty to public uses or purposes In India the Act provides directly for acquisition of particular property for public purpose Though right to property is no longer fundamental right but Article A of the Constitution mandates that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law The exceptional and extraordinary power of doing away with an enquiry under Section A in a case where possession of the land is required urgently or in unforeseen emergency is provided in Section of the Act Such power is not a routine power and save circumstances warranting immediate possession it should not be lightly invoked The guideline is inbuilt in Section itself for exercise of the exceptional power in dispensing with enquiry under Section A The government obviously therefore has to apply its mind before it dispenses with enquiry under Section A on the aspect whether the urgency is of such a nature that justifies elimination of summary enquiry under Section A A repetition of statutory phrase in the notification that the state government is satisfied that the land specified in the notification is urgently needed and provision contained in Section A shall not apply though may initially raise a presumption in favour of the government that pre requisite conditions for exercise of such power have been satisfied but such presumption may be displaced by the circumstances themselves having no reasonable nexus with the purpose for which power has been exercised Upon challenge being made to the use of power under Section the government must produce appropriate material before the court that the opinion for dispensing with the enquiry under Section A has been formed by the government after due application of mind on the material placed before it It is true that power conferred upon the government under Section is administrative and its opinion is entitled to due weight but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the urgency based on considerations not germane to the purpose the judicial review of such administrative decision may become necessary As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can be invoked are specified in Section but circumstances necessitating invocation of urgency under Section are not stated in the provision itself Generally speaking the development of an area for residential purposes or a planned development of city takes many years if not decades and therefore there is no reason why summary enquiry as contemplated under Section A may not be held and objections of land owners persons interested may not be considered In many cases on general assumption likely delay in completion of enquiry under Section A is set up as a reason for invocation of extraordinary power in dispensing with the enquiry little realizing that an important and valuable right of the person interested in the land is being taken away and with some effort enquiry could always be completed expeditiously The special provision has been made in Section to eliminate enquiry under Section A in deserving and cases of real urgency The government has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates dispensation of enquiry under Section A We have already noticed few decisions of this Court There is conflict of view in the two decisions of this Court viz In Om Prakash this Court held that decision in <NAME> must be confined to the fact situation in those days when it was rendered and the two Judge Bench could not have laid down a proposition contrary to the decision in <NAME> The view of this Court has differed on this aspect due to different fact situation prevailing in those cases In our opinion such delay will have material bearing on the question of invocation of urgency power particularly in a situation where no material has been placed by the appropriate government before the court justifying that urgency was of such nature that necessitated elimination of enquiry under Section A There is no doubt that planned development and housing are matters of priority in developing nation Abruptly the notifications for the proposed acquisition were issued on November February under Section of the Act It is true that insofar as Uttar Pradesh is concerned there is amendment in Section Sub section A enables the <ORG> to take possession under sub section of Section if the land is required for public purpose viz Although some correspondence between the authorities and the government was placed before <ORG> by the <ORG> but no material has been placed on record by the State <ORG> either before <ORG> or before this Court indicating the application of mind that the urgency was of such nature which warranted elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act In the written submissions of the <ORG> it is stated that subsequent to the declaration made under Section of the Act in the month of December award has been made and out of the land owners more than have already received compensation It was submitted by the appellants that houses structures and buildings including educational building are existing on the subject land and as per the policy framed by <ORG> the land deserves to be exempted from acquisition The submission of the appellants has been countered by the respondents and in the written submissions filed by the <ORG> it is stated that the houses structures and buildings which are claimed to exist have been raised by the appellants subsequent to the notification under Section of the Act and therefore they are not entitled to release of their land from acquisition
