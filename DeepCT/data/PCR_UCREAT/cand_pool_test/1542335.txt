The appellant moved <ORG> for a writ to quash the order directing the said enquiry He claimed that Government had no power to re open the enquiry concluded by the decision of <ORG> and that the State was bound to pay him salary with increments for the period of suspension as if he was on duty during that period of the Constitution and there was no justification for not granting him full salary The appellant came up in appeal to <ORG> by certificate Held further that of the Fundamental Rules of the Uttar Pradesh Government enables <ORG> of fix the pay of a public servant when dismissed is set aside in a departmental appeal but that rule has no application to cases in which the dismissal of a public servant is declared invalid by the decree of <ORG> and he is consequently re instated The appellant then commenced an action Suit No of in <ORG> Lucknow challenging the legality of the order of dismissal principally on the ground that he was not afforded the opportunity of defending himself and of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him <ORG> accordingly allowed the appeal set aside the decree of the Civil Judge and granted a declaration that the order passed by <ORG> dated September purporting to dismiss the appellant was void inoperative and illegal and the appellant must be deemed to continue in service of the constitution praying for a writ quashing the order directing enquiry into the allegations regarding his work and conduct as Tehsildar at Garautha District Jhansi and for a direction setting aside the order of suspension dated July and for a direction permitting the appellant to draw his full salary and allowances with all increments amounting to Rs The appellant claimed that the Government of Uttar Pradesh had no power to reopen the enquiry concluded by the decision of <ORG> of Allahabad and that the <ORG> was bound to pay him salary with increments and allowances for the period of suspension as if he was on duty during that period He also claimed that he must be deemed to have been confirmed in the post of a Tehsildar and therefore entitled to salary in the grade of Tehsildar In the view of <ORG> the appellant having been reinstated there was no justification for not granting him full salary till July the date till which he continued to function as Tehsildar after reinstatement But <ORG> observed A writ of mandamus can however only direct the opposite parties to proceed in accordance with law Against the order passed by <ORG> partially allowing the petition and directing <ORG> to reconsider the matter regarding the pay and allowances due to the appellant for the period November to April this appeal has been preferred with certificate of fitness granted under Articles and of the Constitution The suit filed by the appellant was decreed only on the ground that he had not been afforded a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the charge against him and also the punishment decided to be imposed upon him <ORG> in the appeal filed by the appellant in suit No of did not exonerate the appellant from the charges <ORG> decreed the suit on the ground that the procedure for imposing the penalty was irregular and such a decision cannot prevent the <ORG> from commencing another enquiry in respect of the same subject matter consistently with the provisions of Arts In <NAME> case it was held that an order in exercise of powers of revision by the Governor under the authority reserved to him setting aside on order of censure passed by a subordinate authority and dismissing the public servant concerned from service did not amount to a second departmental enquiry These cases do not lend support to the proposition that after an order passed in a enquiry against a public servant imposing a penalty is quashed by a civil court no further proceeding can be commenced against him even if in the proceeding can be commenced against him even if in the proceeding in which the order quashing the enquiry was passed the merits of the charge against the public servant concerned were never investigated If <ORG> was competent to order a fresh enquiry we see no reason why it would be incompetent to direct suspension of the appellant during the pendency of the enquiry <ORG> in dealing with the appellant claim to salary during the period of his suspension pending the earlier enquiry observed that there was no justification for not granting the appellant his full pay for the period after the date of the suit In a case falling under clause the period of absence from duty shall not be treated as period spent on duty unless such competent authority specifically directs that it shall be so treated for any specified purposes This rule has no application to cases like the present in which the dismissal of a public servant is declared invalid by a civil court and he is reinstated
