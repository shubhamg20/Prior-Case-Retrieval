We have put the vendees into possession and enjoyment of the aforesaid property together with all that cesses and revenues The learned Judge after a review of the authorities held that the document of the th of August was not a mortgage but an out and out sale and that any claim on foot of the subsequent document of the th of September was barred by limitation On the other hand it is contended that the two documents are evidence of two different transactions one being an out and out sale the other an agreement to re sell within a limited time and that the case is governed by the ruling of their Lordships of <ORG> in Bhagwan Sahai Bhagwan Din A I A <NAME> and others who professed to be the proprietors of certain property declared that they had pf their own accord absolutely sold the entire property to <NAME> in consideration of a sum of Rs Sir <NAME> who delivered the judgment of their Lordships of <ORG> held reversing the decisions of the <ORG> below that it was clear that this case was not one of mortgagor and mortgagee but one of an absolute sale with a right to re purchase within a period of ten years The documents taken together do not on the face of them constitute a mortgage and assuming that they are to be read together there is nothing in them to indicate that they represented a mortgage transaction Prima facie an absolute conveyance containing nothing to show that the relationship of debtor and creditor is to exist between the parties does not cease to be no absolute conveyance merely because the vendor stipulates that he shall have a right to re purchase But there was in this case no stipulation on the part of the vendor that he should have a right to purchase Reliance was placed on the language in question in view of the decision of their Lordships of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> A I A A second document was executed by the banking firm to the plaintiff on the same day whereby the firm agreed to re sell the property to <NAME> if he paid on the st of March the sum of Rs Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of their Lordships in the course of his judgment pointed out that mortgages by conditional sale under various names were a common form of mortgage in India and that this form was introduced to enable Muhammadans contrary to the precepts of their religion to lend money at interest and obtain security for principal and interest and that therefore one would expect to find that the transaction would be made to assume the appearance of a sale Referring to the case of <NAME> Bhagwan Din A I A he observed Their Lordships decided that case on the language of the deeds in question which they evidently considered showed that the transaction was not such a transaction as is described in the Regulation of and there was therefore no right of redemption after the expiry of the date fixed It was not suggested that there was any other statutory provision or practice by which such deposit could be made by virtue of the agreement alone without the intervention of the <ORG> in a suit for the purpose while on the other hand the words exactly describe the procedure under the Regulation Again he observed the estate was made redeemable only on payment as well of the amount which should be found due at the time of redemption on account of the Basharatpur concern as of the stipulated sum of Rs If there is no such power there is no mortgage He observed The fair criterion by which the <ORG>is to decide whether this deed be a mortgage or not I apprehend to be this are the remedies mutual and reciprocal has the defendant all the remedies a mortgagee is entitled to Tried by this test there can be no doubt that the transactions before us did not constitute a mortgage A sale with a provision for re purchase is not common either in this country or in England but there is nothing illegal or objectionable in such a transaction There is nothing in them to indicate that the parties did not intend that these documents should operate according to their tenor There is nothing illegal in a transaction of sale with an agreement for re sale within a limited time and I fail to see why these documents should be interpreted differently from any other document I am at a loss to understand on what principle of equity or good conscience the plaintiffs appellants can justly claim a right now to redeem or repurchase the property I would therefore dismiss the appeal Bearing these circumstances in mind if we look at the transaction in question it seems to me to be clear that it was a bxi bil wafa mortgage that is a conditional sale and not an absolute sale with a right of re purchase I would therefore allow the appeal set aside the decree of the <ORG> below and remand the case to that <ORG> for trial on the merits
