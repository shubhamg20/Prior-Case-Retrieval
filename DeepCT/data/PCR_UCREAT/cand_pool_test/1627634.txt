This appeal is directed against the order of the Commissioner Appeals dated passed in Appeal No Subsequently on the firm filed a revised return showing an income of Rs The difference between the income disclosed in the original return and the one returned in the revised return is on account of the claim made under the head bad debts It only gives a right to an assessee to revise a return already tiled under Sub section or Sub section In Metal India Products case supra the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court was of the view that where the assessee filed his return within the time prescribed by Section and where no notice was issued by the ITO to the assessee under Section even if the assessee filed its return under Section within four years from the end of the assessment year and before the assessment order was passed the assessee is liable to pay penalty under Section a of the Act for not having filed the return within the time prescribed in Section or the time given under Section The law gives him a right to substitute and bring on record a correct and complete return if he discovers any omission or wrong statement in the return originally filed by him The law cannot content plate the making of an assessment on the basis of a return which even the assessee claims contains wrong statements When an assessee files a revised return he in fact admits that the original return filed by him was not correct or complete and substitutes the same by a revised return which according to him is correct and complete While coming to the aforesaid conclusion <ORG> dissented from the view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra Therefore <ORG> held that the subsequent return filed by the assessee was a valid return under Section and the assessment made thereunder was within the time prescribed under Section of the Act There was no provision in Section of the Act under which losses had to be determined for the purpose of Section Section A simply laid down that in order to obtain the benefit of Section the assessee must submit his return showing loss within the time specified by Section It was held that a return showing a loss submitted at any time before the assessment was made was valid as it could be contended that Section was merely a proviso to Section Therefore it was submitted that inasmuch as the assessee itself filed two returns the <ORG> was made to proceed on the second return wherein bad debt deduction was claimed ITR contended that when there are two views possible on the same point that which is in favour of the assessee should be followed We have heard the rival submissions We have to decide the case in the light of the judgments of the various <ORG> relied on by the parties We have already set out the reasoning of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra which we repeat as under Sub section is a part of Section In the present case the assessee had filed a return showing an income of as much as Rs We have carefully considered the views expressed by the Delhi and the Allahabad <ORG> but we would respectfully follow the reasoning of <ORG> and hold that merely because the first return filed on showing an income of Rs for the assessment year was a return under Section the assessee was not prevented from filing the revised return showing an income of Rs were being written off without any action being taken for recovery of the debts Before the <ORG> it was submitted that the firm incurred heavy losses and the business had come to an end In the original return filed by the assessee there was no claim for deduction of bad debts The original return declared an income of Rs The learned Commissioner Appeals pointed out that apart from the verbal observations of the assessee firm there is no other evidence to indicate that the debts had become bad and odd were written off without any effort being made for recovery However under these circumstances he considered that amounts of less than Rs should be treated as bad and benefit should be given to the assessee on these amounts Accordingly to that extent we allow the appeal in part
