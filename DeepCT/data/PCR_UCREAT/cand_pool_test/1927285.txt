The following Judgment of the Court was delivered WITH Civil Appeal Nos of of and of <NAME> Leave granted in SLP Nos of The common question which arises in these appeals is whether the turn over in respect of hides and skins which has once been subjected to tax under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act on its purchase at the raw stage could be taxed again on inter state sales as tanned or dressed hides and skins According to the appellants they purchase raw hides and skins and after dressing they are sold in the course of inter state trade The further finding of <ORG> was that there was no merit in the challenge to the legality of the entries which had been substituted in the IInd Schedule by the Amending Act of In order to appreciate the rival contentions it is necessary to refer to the statutory provisions Restrictions and conditions in regard to tax on sale or purchase of declared goods within a State Every sales tax law of a State shall in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods be subject to the following restrictions and conditions namely a the tax payable under the law in respect of any sale or purchase of such goods inside the State shall not exceed four per cent of the sale or purchase price thereof and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage Where a tax has been levied under that law in respect of the sale or purchase inside the State or any declared goods and such goods are sold in the course of inter state trade or commerce and tax has been paid under this Act in respect of the sale of such goods in the course of inter state trade or commerce the tax levied under such law shall be reimbursed to the person making such sale in the course of inter state trade or commerce in such manner and subject to such conditions as may be provided in any law in force in that State This was done in view of the provisions of Sections and of the Central Act In the cured state the raw materials can be preserved for a temporary period These tanned hides and skins are processed further to yield dressed hides and skins which are then ready for use After raw hides and skins are purchased they are then dressed which has the effect of preserving them This being so it was contended hide and skins can be taxed at only one stage in the State with the result that if they have been subjected to tax at the raw state under the local Act then section of the Central Sales Tax Act would have the effect of preventing tax being levied on dressed hides and skins In the alternative it was contended that even assuming that raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins could be considered to be commercially distinct commodities under Section III even then Section III of the Central Sales Tax Act regards hides and skins as a single commodity and they cannot be taxed twice over in any one State Elaborating this contention it was submitted that Section of the Central Sales Tax Act provides that every sales tax law of a State shall insofar as it imposes or authorises the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods imposes two restrictions namely the tax payable of declared goods imposes two restrictions namely the tax payable in respect of such goods cannot exceed and secondly it cannot be levied at more than one stage On behalf of the appellants strong reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in the cases of State of Tamil Nadu Vs <ORG> etc Reliance was placed on this observation and it was contended that because the entry in Section III reads as hides and skins raw or dressed it would mean that raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins are treated as a single commodity In the case of <ORG> supra the question which arose was whether leather splits and coloured leather were hides and skins which fall in the category of declared goods as set out in Section of the Central Sales Tax Act and therefore entitled to the concession available under Section of the Act namely the benefits of single point taxation and of a smaller rate of tax Dealing with the question relating to coloured leather the <ORG> dealt with the process in which the raw hides and skins undergo till they are tanned and observed as follows Structurally hides and skins have a thick middle layer called corium which is converted to leather by tanning The operations involved in leather manufacture however fall into three groups Pre tanning operations include soaking liming deliming bating and picking and post tanning operations are splitting and shaving neutralising bleaching dyeing fat liquoring and stuffing setting out samming drying staking and finishing These operations bring about chemical changes in the leather substance and influence the physical characteristics of the leather and different varieties of commercial leather are obtained by suitably adjusting the manufacturing operations These processes need not be gone into in detail but the passages relied upon clearly show that hides and skins are termed leather even as soon as the process of tanning is over and the danger of their putrefaction is put an end to The entry in the CST Act however includes within its scope hides and skins until they are dressed This as we have seen represents the stage when they undergo the process of finishing and assume a form in which they can be readily utilised for manufacture of various commercial articles The statutory entry is comprehensive enough to include the products emerging from hides and skins until the process of dressing or finishing is done Even though the aforesaid decisions seem to support the contentions urged on behalf of the appellants we find that the two questions involved in these cases namely whether dressed hides and skins and raw hides and tanned skins are different commodities and secondly whether Section iii of the Central Sales Tax Act regards them as the single commodity appear to have been decided differently by a Constitution Bench of this <ORG> in <NAME> and Company Vs <ORG> of Madras SCR The appellant therein had contended that tanned and untanned hides and skins did not form different commodities and therefore tax could not be levied on the sales of hides and skins in the raw condition when no tax is levied on the sale of hides and skins in the tanned condition If then dealt with the contention that tanning was only a preservative process which makes no change in the nature of the article itself a submission which has also been raised in the present case on behalf of the appellant The appellant therein had also referred to the decision in <NAME> and Company Vs State of Madras STC where the following observations had been made at page Section of the Central Sales Tax Act Act of also treats hides and skin whether dressed or raw as a single commodity Since skins tanned or untanned constitute only one class of goods and the sale of that class of goods can be taxed only at a single point obviously there can be no tax on a sale of tanned goods if tax has already been paid on an earlier transaction when those skins were untanned The aforesaid conclusion in <NAME> case was not accepted by this <ORG> and it was observed at page that no reason is given why the two kinds of hides and skins are treated as a single commodity Again at page the finding of the <ORG> was that we therefore hold that raw hides and skins dressed hides and skins constitute different commodities of merchandise and they could therefore be treated as different goods for the purposes of the Act From the aforesaid observations it clearly follows that <ORG> had in no uncertain terms come to the conclusion that raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins were not one and the same commodity Therefore the first contention raised in the present case by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be accepted notwithstanding the reliance by them on the aforesaid decision in the case of <ORG> case As already noted herein above this <ORG> specifically referred to those observations in <NAME> case supra which had interpreted Section iii of the Central Sales Tax Act to mean that hides and skins whether dressed or raw were single commodity and this observation was disapproved when at page this <ORG> observed in <NAME> case that no reason is given why the two kinds of hides and skins are treated as a single commodity vi The sale of hides and skins whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under section sub section only at such single point in series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed It is while interpreting this that it was held that raw and dressed hides and skins were different articles and that is why the legislature could provide differently about their taxation After referring to <NAME> Vs Excise and Taxation Officer STC wherein it was held that ginned and unginned cotton constituted one commodity inter alia for the reason that ginned and un ginned cotton were under the same head and thereby indicating that the legislature looked upon ginned and un ginned cotton as one and the same thing it was held in <NAME> case at page that The fact that certain articles are mentioned under the same heading in a statute or the Constitution does not mean that they all constitute one commodity When dressed hides and skins are different goods from raw hides and skins we do not find anything in the language of Section of the Central Sales Tax Act which can lead us to the conclusion that these two different commodities were to be regarded as constituting a single commodity for the purpose of taxation While Section enumerates the items which are regarded as being goods of special importance in inter state trade or commerce it is Section which imposes the restriction and conditions in regard to tax on sale or purchase of declared goods within a State Notwithstanding the fact that the raw hides and skins had been held by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra as being distinct from dressed hides and skins the legislature did not think it appropriate to insert a clause similar to Section which may have had the effect of regarding raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins as being treated as a single commodity for the purposes of levy of tax The appeals are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs
