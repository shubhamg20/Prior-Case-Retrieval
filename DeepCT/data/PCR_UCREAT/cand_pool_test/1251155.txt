It appears that this decree was put in execution for the first time in and during the pendency of the execution proceedings an application was made by the judgment debtor under Section Agriculturists Relief Act by which he prayed for instalments Counsel for the judgment debtor made a statement in <ORG> agreeing to the continuance of the attachment of the two houses along with other properties and stating that in default of payment of the decretal amount the two houses and the other property mentioned therein might be sold The executing <ORG> allowed the objection of the judgment debtor and ordered that the property be released from attachment I asked Mr <NAME> counsel for the appellant to satisfy me upon the point whether on evidence on the record the judgment debtor could be said to be an agriculturist within the meaning of Section Civil Mr <NAME> has frankly conceded that there is not sufficient evidence in support of his case upon this point In the first place I am not satisfied that there was any misapprehension as regards the true meaning of the word agriculturist in the <ORG>s below Secondly it is not necessary to go into this matter as the judgment of the lower appellate <ORG> proceeds upon the ground that the judgment debtor was estopped from raising the question that he was an agriculturist within the meaning of Section Civil by reason of the consent order dated th April and as in my opinion the view taken by the lower appellate <ORG> is correct In that ease the parties entered into a compromise by which the judgment debtor agreed that the amount claimed would be paid in certain instalments by him and that on default the creditor would be entitled to realise the same from movable and immovable properties of the judgment debtor and from his person and that the property attached would remain charged for the decretal amount In that case in the course of execution proceedings the judgment debtor had entered into an agreement with the decree holder that he should pay the amount of the decree by instalments and in security for the amount of the decree and costs he had declared that he had mortgaged his residential house With respect I follow the view taken by the Calcutta and the Patna High <ORG>s in these two cases and in my opinion the judgment of the lower appellate <ORG> upon this point is correct In the former case it was held that Section Civil will not operate to bar the sale of a house belonging to an agriculturist in execution of a decree on a mortgage of the same if such house is not an appurtenance of the mortgagor holding which he is prohibited by law from mortgaging or transfer In the latter case their Lordships held the view that Proviso to Section Civil deals with sales held in execution of decrees in which a previous attachment is necessary i sales held in execution of simple money decrees and it does not apply to sales in pursuance of mortgaged decrees decrees directing sale of the mortgaged property and that where an agriculturist mortgages his house and a decree for sale of the same is given the house may be sold in execution of that decree The same result would follow in a case where a statement is made solemnly before the <ORG> that the property might be sold in certain eventualities and acting upon that statement the <ORG> passes an order or a decree In my opinion there is no force in this appeal and I dismiss it with costs
