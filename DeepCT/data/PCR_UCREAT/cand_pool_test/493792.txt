The representatives of the workmen claimed that even if the plea of the employers that the profit and loss account of establishment for the years in question disclosed a loss was correct the ordinance governed the dispute and that the employees were entitled to receive bonus at the minimum rate of of the salary or wages or Rs ii The power to exempt certain establishments from the operation of the Act given to the appropriate <ORG> under was not an unguided power because the <ORG> was enjoined to take public interest the financial position of the establishment and other relevant circumstances into consideration before exercising the said power There was therefore no excessive delegation of leg authority by and the section was valid iii Per <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> The object of the Act being to maintain peace and harmony between labour and capital by allowing the employees to share the prosperity of the establishment reflected by the profits earned by the contributions made by capital management and labour <ORG> has provided that bonus in a given year shall not exceed th and shall not be less than th of the total earning of each individual employee and has directed that the excess shall be carried forward to the next year and that the amount paid by way of minimum bonus not absorbed by the available profits shall be carried to the next year and be set off against the profits of the succeeding years The article guarantees the right against deprivation of property otherwise than by authority of law There was however deprivation by authority of law in the present case Per <NAME> <NAME> concurring Taking the provision for minimum bonus with the provision for set off it can hardly be said that the section is so exorbitant that it amounts to deprivation of the property of the employers with a view to giving it to the workmen If there be no such dispute pending immediately before the date on which the Act becomes operative an establishment win be governed by the Full Bench Formula and will be liable to pay bonus only if there be adequate profits which would justify payment of bonus Assuming that the classification was founded on some intelligible differential which distinguish an establishment from other establishments the differentia has no rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statutory provision viz Therefore two establishments similarly cir cumstanced having no dispute pending relating to bonus between the employers and the workmen in a particular year would be liable to be dealt with differently if in respect of a previous year covered by there is a dispute pending between the employer and the workmen in one establishment and there is no such dispute pending in the other There is no logical basis for the distinction In several statutes a date is generally selected to demarcate pending cases and the selection of the date has never been challenged successfully if there is some rational ground for its selection If the dispute regarding or a later year was decided by the application of the Act it was imperative to reconsider the subsequent years even though there was no dispute in those years By the different treatment of those establishments where a dispute is pending there is no violation of equality The fact that in one there is a dispute and in the other there is not clearly distinguishes the two establishments If the concept of bonus as allocation of an equitable share of the surplus profits of an establishment to the workmen who have contributed to the earning has reality any condition that the ratio on which the share of one party computed on the basis of the working of an earlier year without taking into consideration the special circumstances which had a bearing on the earning of the profits and payment of bonus in that year shall not be touched is arbitrary and unreasonable Sub section of which purports to make the order of the Central <ORG> in such cases final accentuates the vice in sub since by enacting that provision the <ORG> is made the sole judge whether difficulty or doubt had arisen in giving effect to the provisions of the Act whether it is necessary or expedient to remove the doubt or difficulty and whether the provision enacted is not inconsistent with the purpose of the Act The order of course would be passed within the four corners of the parliamentary legislation and would only apply the Act to concrete cases as the courts do when they consider the application of the Act The order of the Central <ORG> is made final for the reason that it is hardly practical to give power to the Central <ORG> and yet to leave the matter to be litigated further The fact that in the <ORG> of India Act and in the Constitution such a power was and is contemplated and it has been conferred in various Acts without a challenge before shows amply that the argument that the section amounts to delegation of legislative powers on the Central <ORG> is erroneous of the Constitution the <ORG> found that there was not enough material on record to decide the issue With special leave the employers have appealed to this Court and they challenge the validity of the Payment of Bonus Act which replaced Ordinance of and especially of the provisons under which bonus at minimum rate is made payable under the Act Claims to receive bonus it appears were made by industrial employees for the first time in India in the towns of Bombay and Ahmedabad after the commencement of the First World War when as a result of inflationary trends there arose considerable disparity between the living wage and the contractual remuneration earned by workmen in the textile industry The employers paid to the workmen increase in wages initially called war bonus and later called special allowance The Court did not commit itself to acceptance of the formula in its entirety but ruled that bonus is not a gratuitous payment made by the employer to his workmen nor a deferred wage and that where wages fall short of the living standard and the industry makes profit part of which is due to the contribution of labour a claim for bonus may legitimately be made by the workmen In giving effect to the formula as a general rule from the gross profits determined after debiting the wages and dearness allowances paid to the employees and other items of expenditure against total receipts as disclosed by the profit and loss account are accepted unless it appears that the debit entries are not supported by recognized accountancy practice or are posted mala fide with the object of reducing gross profits Rebate of income tax available to the employer on the amount of bonus paid to the workmen cannot be added to the available surplus of profits determined in accordance with the Full Bench Formula which should be taken into account only in distributing the available surplus between workmen industry and employers Attempts made from time to time to secure revision of the Formula failed before this Court The <ORG> held an elaborate enquiry and reported that bonus was paid to the workers as a share in the prosperity of the establishment and recommended adherence to the basic scheme of the Bonus Formula viz should remain with the establishment into which would merge the saving in tax on bonus payable and the aggregate balance thus left to the establishment may be intended to provide for gratuity other necessary reserves rehabilitation in addition to the provision made by way of depreciation in the prior charges annual provision required for redemption of debentures return of borrowings payment of super profits tax and additional return on capital The Government of India accepted a majority of the recom mendations and the President issued on May the Payment of Bonus Ordinance providing for payment of bonus to all employees drawing salary not exceeding Rs It may be broadly stated that bonus which was originally a voluntary payment out of profits to workmen to keep them contented acquired the character under the Bonus Formula of a right to share in the surplus profits and enforceable through the machinery of the Industrial Disputes Act That argument has no force It is not denied that the <ORG> has power to legislate in respect of bonus to be paid to industrial employees <ORG> has normally power within the frame work of the Constitution to enact legislation which modifies principles enunciated by this Court as applicable to the determination of any dispute and by exercising that power the <ORG> does not perpetrate fraud on the Constitution By save as otherwise provided in the Act the provisions of the Act shall in relation to a factory or other establishment to which the Act applies have effect in respect of the accounting year commencing on any day in the year and in respect of every subsequent accounting year Employee is defined in as meaning any person other than an apprentice employed on a salary or wage not exceeding one thousand and six hundred rupees per mensem in any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual supervisory managerial administrative technical or clerical work for hire or reward whether the terms of employment be express or implied Sections to deal with payment of minimum and maximum bonus and the scheme for set on and set off of the salary or wage earned by the employee during the accounting year or Rs whichever is higher whether there are profits in the accounting year or not By I I where in respect of any accounting year the allocable surplus exceeds the amount of minimum bonus payable the employer shall be bound to pay to every employee in the accounting year bonus which shall be an amount proportionate to the salary or wage earned by the employee during the accounting year subject to a maximum of twenty per cent of such salary or wage By sub it is provided that where for any accounting year there is no available surplus or the allocable surplus in respect of that year falls short of the amount of minimum bonus payable to the employees in the establishment under and there is no amount or sufficient amount carried forward and set on under sub capable of being utilised for the purpose of payment of the minimum bonus then such minimum amount or the deficiency shall be carried forward for being set off in the succeeding accoun ting year up to and inclusive of the fourth accounting year By sub it is provided that principle of set on and set off as illustrated in the Fourth Schedule shall apply to all other cases not covered by sub or sub for the purpose of payment of bonus under the Act Section makes special provisions relating to payment of bonus to employees of establishments which have been newely set up Sections deal with certain procedural and administrative matters Sub of makes special overriding provisions regarding payment of bonus to employees computed as a percentage of gross profits reduced by direct taxes payable for the year subject to the maximum prescribed by when bonus has been paid by the employer to workmen in the base year as defined in Explanation By the appropriate <ORG> is authorised having regard to the financial position and other relevant circumstances of any establishment or class of establishments to exempt for such period as may be specified therein such establishment or class of establishments from all or any of the provisions of the Act and by power is conferred upon the Central <ORG> by order to make provision not inconsistent with the purposes of the Act for removal of difficulties or doubts in giving effect to the provisions of the Act The scheme of the Act broadly stated is four dimensional to impose statutory liability upon an employer of every establishment covered by the Act to pay bonus to employees in the establishment to define the principle of payment of bonus according to the prescribed Formula to provide for payment of minimum and maximum bonus and linking the payment of bonus with the scheme of set off and set on and to provide machinery for enforcement of the liability for payment of bonus But the <ORG> has given by retrospective operation to the Act to certain pending disputes and has sought to provide by while extinguishing all pre existing agreements settlements or contracts of service for freezing the ratio which existed in the base year on which the bonus would be calculated in subsequent years It was urged by counsel for the employers that which provides for payment of minimum bonus which seeks to exclude certain classes of employees from the operation of the Act which seeks to apply the Act to certain pending disputes regarding payment of bonus and sub of which freezes the ratio at which the available surplus in any accounting year has subject to to be distributed if in the base year bonus has been paid are ultra vires because they infringe Arts It was also urged that conferment of power of exemption under is ultra vires the <ORG> in that it invests the appropriate <ORG> with authority to exclude from the application of the Act establishments or a class of establishments if the <ORG>s are of the opinion having regard to the financial position and other relevant circumstances that it would not be in the public interest to apply all or any of the provisions of the Act There is a presumption of constitutionality of a statute when the challenge is founded on Art We therefore decline to express any opinion on the plea of unconsti tutionality raised before us in respect of the inapplicability of the Act to employees described in But which authorises <ORG> to provide by order for removal of doubts or difficulties in giving effect to the provisions of the Act in our judgment delegates legislative power which is not permissible Condition of the applicability of is the arising of the doubt or difficulty in giving effect to the provisions of the Act is made the sole judge whether difficulty or doubt has arisen in giving effect to the provisions of the Act whether it is necessary or expedient to remove the doubt or difficulty and whether the provision enacted is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Act Under the Full Bench Formula bonus being related to available surplus it can only be made payable by an employer of an establishment who makes profit in the accounting year to which the claim for bonus If no profit was made there was no liability to pay bonus As pointed out by this <ORG> in <ORG> case It is therefore clear that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the industrial concern has earned profits If in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss there is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus But by it is provided that even if there has resulted trading loss in the accounting year the employer is bound to pay bonus at of the salary or wages earned by the employee or Rs <ORG> held that the pact did not run counter to the law laid down by this Court in <ORG> case and the extension of the agreement for one more year would help in promoting peace ID the industry in Ahmedabad This Court held that the agreement departed from the Full Bench Formula in that matter of bonus and when the <ORG> extended the agreement after the expiry of the stipulated period it ignored the law as laid down by this Court as to what profit bonus was and how it should be worked out and that the <ORG> had no power to do by extending the agreement to direct payment of minimum bonus for the year when there was no available surplus to pay minimum bonus Indisputably <ORG> has the power to enact legislation with in the constitutional limits to modify the Full Bench Formula even after it has received the approval of this Court The object of the Act being to maintain peace and harmony between labour and capital by allowing the employees to share the prosperity of the establishment reflected by the profits earned by the contributions made by capital management and labour <ORG> has provided that bonus in a given year shall not exceed th and shall not be less than th of the total earning of each individual employee and has directed that the excess share shall be carried forward to the next year and that the amount paid by way of minimum bonus not absorbed by the available profits shall be carried to the next year and be set off against the profits of the succeeding years This <ORG> held that the Act which obliged every person who held land to pay the tax at a uniform rate whether he made any income out of the land or whether the land was capable of yielding any income attempted no classification and that lack of classification by the Act itself created inequality and was on that account hit by the prohibition against denial of equality before the law contained in Art The <ORG> also held that the Act was confiscatory in character since it had the effect of eliminating private ownership of land through the machinery of the Act without proposing to acquire privately owned forests for the <ORG> It was not said by the <ORG> in that case that imposition of uniform liability upon persons Invalidity of legislation is not established by merely finding faults with the scheme adopted by the <ORG> to achieve the purpose it has in view Equal treatment of unequal objects transactions or persons in not liable to be struck down as discriminatory Unless there is simultaneously absence of a rational relation to the object intended to be achieved by the law We need say nothing at this date about the plea that by imposing unreasonable restrictions infringes the fundamental freedom under Art Validity of the law authorising deprivation of property may be challenged on three grounds i incompetence of the authority which has enacted the law ii infringement by the law of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Ch III of the Constitution and iii A dispute shall be deemed to be pending before the appropriate Government where no decision of that Government on any application made to it under the said Act or such corresponding law for reference of that dispute to adjudication has been made or where having received the report of the Conciliation Officer by whatever designation known under the said Act or law the appropriate Government has not passed any order refusing to make such reference The provisions of the Act also apply even if there be no dispute pending for the year subsequent to the year ending on any day in the year provided there is a dispute pending in respect of an earlier year In considering the effect of regard must first be had to which provides that save as otherwise provided in the section the provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the terms of any award agreement settlement or contract of service made before May Even if in respect of an year there is no such dispute pending on May because of a dispute pending in respect of an earlier year not being earlier than the year ending on any day in the same consequences follow The expression industrial dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act inter alia means a dispute or difference between employer and workmen which is connected with the employment or non employment or the terms of employment or with the conditions of labour of any person and the expression workmen is defined in of the Industrial Disputes Act means any person including an apprentice employed in any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual supervisory technical or clerical work for hire or reward Even if before May there had been a settlement with some workmen or those workmen had not made any claim previously and there would on that account be no industrial dispute pending qua those workmen pendency of a dispute relating to bonus in which some other workmen are interested imposes statutory liability upon the employer to pay bonus to all employees in the establishment Application of the Act for the year for which the bonus dispute is pending therefore creates an onerous liability on the employer concerned because employees who could not claim bonus under the Industrial Disputes Act become entitled thereto merely because there was a dispute pending between the workmen in that establishment or some of them and the employer qua bonus workmen who had under agreement settlements contracts or awards become entitled to bonus at certain rates cease to be bound by such agreements settlements contracts or even awards and become entitled to claim bonus at the rate computed under the scheme of the Act basis of the computation of gross profits available surplus and bonus is completely changed the scheme of set on and set off prescribed by of the Act becomes operative and applies to esta blishments as from the year in respect of which the bonus dispute is pending and the scheme of the Act operates not only in respect of the year for which the bonus dispute was pending but also in respect of subsequent years for which there is no bonus dispute pending If there be no such dispute pending immediately before the date on which the Act becomes operative an establishment will be governed by the provisions of the Full Bench Formula and will be liable to pay bonus only if there be adequate profits which would justify payment of bonus Assuming that the classification is founded on some intelligible differentia which distinguishes an establishment from other establishments the differentia has no rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statutory provision viz Therefore two establishments similarly circumstanced having no dispute pending relating to bonus between the employers and the workmen in a particular year would be liable to be dealt with differently if in respect of a previous year covered by there is a dispute pending between the employer and the workmen in one establishment and there is no such dispute pending in the other There is one other ground which emphasizes the arbitrary character of the classification The High <ORG> has also jurisdiction in a petition under Art to issue an order or direction declaring an order of <ORG> invalid and issue of such writ order or direction will ordinarily involve retrial of the proceeding Again pendency of a dispute in respect of the previous year before the appropriate <ORG> or <ORG> will entail imposition of a statutory liability to pay bonus in respect of the year for which the dispute is pending and also in respect of years subsequent thereto but if immediately before May a proceeding arising out of a dispute relating to bonus is pending before a superior court even if it be for the years which are covered by statutory liability to pay bonus to employees will not be attracted There appears neither logic nor reason in the different treatment meted out to the two establishments Tribunal or other authority under the Industrial Disputes Act XIV of or under any corresponding law relating to investigation and settlement of industrial disputes in a State the accounting year immediately preceding the accounting year to which the dispute relates ii in any other case the period of twelve months immediately preceding the accounting year in respect of which this Act becomes applicable to the establishment gross profits in relation to the base year or as the case may be to the accounting year means gross profits as reduced by the direct taxes payable by the employer in respect of that year Under if the total bonus payable in any accounting year after the Act had come into force is less than the total bonus paid or payable in the base year under any award agreement settlement or contract of service bonus for the accounting year has to be determined according to the following scheme First determine the ratio of the bonus paid or payable to all employees not workmen merely as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act for the base year as defined in Explanation II a to the gross profits as defined in Explanation II of that year and apply that ratio to the gross profits as defined in Explanation to the accounting year and determine the allocable surplus That allocable surplus will be distributed among the employees subject to the restriction that no employee shall be paid bonus which exceeds of the salary or wage earned by an employee and that if the allocable surplus so computed exceeds the amount of maximum bonus payable to the employees in the establishment then the provisions of shall so far as may be apply to the excess If there be no dispute pending the period of twelve months immediately preceding the accounting year in which the Act becomes applicable to the establishment is the base year There is also a special method for determining whether the total bonus payable to all the employees is less than the total bonus paid or payable in respect of the base year In order to buy peace and in the expectation that in future the working of the establishments would be more profitable employers had in certain cases paid bonus out of reserves even though there was no gross profit or insufficient gross profit and those establishments are under saddled with liability to allocate large sums of money wholly dispropor tionate to or without any surplus profits and even to the amount which would be payable if the scheme of the Act applied For in Cases where there were no gross profit the ratio between the amount paid or payable as bonus and gross profit would reach infinity in cases where the gross profits were small and substantial amounts were paid or became payable by way of bonus the ratio may become unduly large These are not cases hypothetical but practical which had arisen in fact and application of the ratio irrevocably fixes the liability of the establishment to set apart year after year large amounts whether the establishment made profits or not tow ards allocable surplus If the concept of bonus as allocation of an equitable share of the surplus profits of an establishment to the workmen who have contributed to the earning has reality any condition that the ratio on which the share of one party computed on the basis of the working of an earlier year without taking into consideration the special circumstances which had a bearing on the earning of the profits and payment of bonus in that year shall not be touched is in our judgment arbitrary and unreasonable All proceedings which are pending before the Act came into force including those which are convered by will therefore be governed by the Full Bench Formula and that ill the application of the Act the special ratio for determining the allocable surplus under will be ignored for application of the Full Bench Formula to pending proceedings on May and refusal to apply the special ratio in the determination of allocable surplus under does not affect the scheme of the rest of the Act It delegates to the executive authority legislative powers This demand was refused by the employers on the ground among others that there was no surplus as the <ORG> was carrying forward a big loss In this appeal by special leave against the said order the validity of of the Payment of Bonus Act which received the assent of the President on September and replaced the Ordinance with a few changes is challenged The <ORG> found no legal foundation for the claim especially when there were no profits At first it was merely treated as rooted in fair play but later it was held to be claimable as of right and ranking in importance next only to the claim of minimum wages and dearness allowance which were considered the first liability of the employer There was no settled principle as to how the available surplus should be divided between the employers and workmen and this <ORG> in the absence of any discernable principles suggested a half and half division Lastly there were quarrels about the division of the available surplus Only the fundamental proposals can be mentioned here for we are concerned with them as part of the history lying at the back of the legislation impugned here and because a great deal of thought went into the formulation of these proposals The development rebate which took the place of initial depreciation under the previous Income tax law was not allowed to be deducted but the <ORG> was of opinion that the tax concession on account of development rebate should be retained by the employers and must therefore be deducted from the gross profits If there were no profits or if profits could allow payment of bonus more than the maximum a principle of set oil and set off was devised Employer means a person employed on a salary or wage which does not exceed Rs whichever be greater whether there are profits in the accounting year or not Although bonus is payable to employees drawing salary or wage up to Rs Section makes special provision with respect to new establishments and new departments or undertakings in old establishments and generally gives them exemptions from payment of bonus for the first five years or till profit is made whichever be earlier which lays down certain special rules regarding the effect of laws and agreements inconsistent with the Bonus Act which gives power of exemption and which enables <ORG> by order to remove any difficulty or doubt arising in giving effect to the provisions of the Act Section enables <ORG> to make rules and under the provisions of the Act are to be in addition to and not in derogation of the Industrial Disputes Act or any corresponding law relating to investigation and settlement of industrial disputes in force in a State They object to some of its provisions on various grounds and we shall now proceed to examine them inasmuch as it makes no difference between companies making profits and companies having losses whether marginal or heavy Section is said to enable deprivation of the property of the employers with a view to paying it to the workmen Taking the provision for minimum bonus with the provision for set off it can hardly be said that the section is so exorbitant that it amounts to deprivation of the property of the employers with a view to giving it to the workmen It is next contended that creates inequality because it excludes II kinds of establishments from the operation of the Act At first sight a provision calculated to exclude a few selected establishments from an otherwise uniform law must savour of discrimination but it must be borne in mind that there are establishments and establishments and certain classes of establishments cannot with any practical advantage or without fear of harm be classified with others We accordingly do not express any opinion on this section Similarly which gives further power to <ORG> to exempt in the public interest an establishment or class of establishments for some period subject to such condition as <ORG> might deem necessary to impose does not per se augur discrimination The existence of such a provision is not bad because it merely gives a power Section gives power to <ORG> to make orders not inconsistent with the purposes of the Act as may be necessary or expedient for the removal of any difficulty or doubt and the order is made final As a legislative practice this is not new and the fact that one provision is in the Constitution and in some other the order has to be laid on the table of <ORG> makes no difference On this argument all the orders issued under these provisions must be treated as void The power to pass an order of this character cannot be used to add to or deduct from that which the Act provides This power is given to <ORG> so that litigation may not ensue as the policy of Act is to avoid litigation The order of course would be passed within the four corners of the parliamentary legislation and would only apply the Act to concrete cases as the courts do when they consider the application of an Act The order of <ORG> is made final for the reason that it is hardly practical to give power to <ORG> and yet to leave the matter to be litigated further But by ss and the provisions are made applicable with some modifications in respect of accounting years earlier than the first accounting year mentioned in To achieve this result sub section of provides that the provisions of the Act as modified by shall apply notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the terms of any award agreement settlement or contract of service made before the th May These two dates determine the class of establishments to which the special provisions of ss and are made applicable If there was a dispute pending in respect of an accounting year not earlier than an accounting year ending in the year the dispute is to be resolved as laid down in the Act with the special modifications made by notwithstanding that there was no dispute in subsequent years and the bonus for the subsequent years is also to be calculated in accordance with the Act so modified The question is whether this classification is so arbitrary and creates such differences that it cannot be reasonably related to the object which the Bonus Act intends to achieve namely the settlement of all bonus disputes in future and to lay down a uniform formula which is considered reasonable both for the workmen as well as the employers so long as the Act remains in force Firstly it is said that the Act creates inequality inasmuch as the formula under the Act is made applicable to cases pending for the application of the Full Bench Formula in respect of accounting years from onwards but leaves the establishments in which there was no dispute to be governed by the Full Bench Formula The onerous nature it is submitted arises from the fact that payment of minimum bonus even if there is a loss is compulsory new categories of workmen have become entitled to bonus salary or wage is made equal to wages plus dearness allowance and the employers lose the advantage of deductions on account of rehabilitation There were two alternatives open For other cases there was a clear need for classification and classification was thus resorted to That sub section applied only to establishments in which there was a prior history of bonus payment and attempted to harmonize the application of the law to establishments in which disputes were pending and those in which there was no dispute Section deals with two matters It deals with establishments in which a dispute as laid down in was pending and also with old establishments in which there was payment of bonus in the past but no dispute was pending when the Ordinance was pro mulgated It applies the Act to both sets of cases It lays down a simple condition that the total bonus for any accounting year should correspond to the level of total bonus paid in a base year and for this purpose the allocable surplus in an accounting year dealt with under the Act must bear the same proportion to gross profits as the total bonus paid in the base year did to the gross profits of the base year subject however to the maximum limit and the principle of set on All such establishments were dealt with uniformly and there was no discrimination or inequality among them except what was said to arise from In several statutes a date is generally selected to demarcate pending cases and the selection of the date has never been challenged successfully if there is some rational ground for its selection If the dispute regarding or a later year was decided by the application of the Act it was imperative to reconsider the subsequent years even though there was no dispute in those years It is said that two establishments equally situated are likely to be differently treated depending on the fortuitous circumstance of the existence of a dispute but is not this assumption an imaginary one the fact that in one there is a dispute and in the other there is not clearly distinguishes the two establishments Section by providing uniformly for all pending cases without any discrimination between them has established a rational classification The ratio so established is only applicable if there is allocable surplus and the total payment of bonus cannot in any event exceed which it might well have done if there was no limit It is however submitted that the Act has ignored the definition of workmen in the Industrial Disputes Act and by allowing bonus to employees drawing salary or wage up to Rs The question thus is one of the power of <ORG> to enact a law relating to bonus Once the power to make the law is found then the law so made cannot be struck down unless it offends a fundamental right For example it was even suggested that the ratio between profits and allocable surplus in a base year might be infinity if there was no profit overlooking the simple fact that existence of profit is a condition precedent to the finding of the ratio there is no reason why it cannot order decision of pending cases treated as a class according to the new formula and open up the intervening years of account for reconsideration Of course in doing this it should treat alike all establishments in which there is a pending dispute If that action is legal so is this provided there is no discrimination There is none in this class either Uniformity in each class has been achieved and there is no discrimination The Act further confers power to exempt and remove doubts and difficulties which provisions are unfortunately criticized and they can be invoked where in spite of so much care there is hardship in a special case We would dismiss the appeal and the writ petitions with costs ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeal is allowed and the order of <ORG> set aside The writ petitions are allowed in part and ss and are declared ultra vires
