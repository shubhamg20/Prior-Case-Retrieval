JUDGMENT <NAME> This first appeal from order has been filed by the plaintiffs against the order of Mr <NAME> Additional District Judge dated th December by which the learned Judge has refused the application of the plaintiffs for grant of ad interim injunction restraining the defendants from printing publishing or selling etc Feeling aggrieved the plaintiffs have instituted the suit on nd October in the court below which has given rise to this appeal They have contended that the defendants by publishing the <ORG> in dispute are passing off their goods as the goods of the plaintiffs and that the title printed by them is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs and that the defendants be restrained from publishing or selling the same The suit has been contested by defendant No as well as by defendant No During the trial of the suit an application under Order Rules I and read with Section of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed by the plaintiffs for the grant of an ad interim injunction which was supported by an affidavit The application has also been contested by defendant No and he has taken up the plea that the author of the <ORG> was <NAME> who was his grand father and that his copyright in the <ORG> had not been assigned to the plaintiffs but the same has been inherited by the defendant No The learned Additional Bistrict Judge by the impugned order has held that the plaintiffs did not have a prima jacie case as they had claimed exclusive copy right which they have failed to establish and that the balance of convenience lay in favor of the defendants who had already published and sold some copies and therefore the learned Judge refused the injunction but directed the defendants to keep accounts of the sales of the <ORG> Feeling I have heard the counsel for the parties at considerable length Section confers Jurisdiction on <ORG> to try suits for passing off <NAME> in Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names th edition in paragraph on page has stated that it is an actionable wrong for the defendant to represent for trading purposes that his goods arc those or that his business is that of the plaintiff and it makes no difference whether the representation is effected by direct statements or by using some of the badges by which the goods of the plaintiffs arc known to be his or any badges colourably resembling these in connection with goods of the same kind not being the goods of the plaintiff in such a manner as to be calculated to cause the goods to be taken by ordinary purchasers for the goods of the plaintiff <NAME> has relied upon an observation in <NAME> <NAME> A where Lord <NAME> observed at page that the principles of law may be very plainly slated that no body has any right to represent his goods as the goods of somebody else and how far the use of particular words signs or pictures docs or does not come up to the proposition enunciated in each particular case must always be a question of evidence by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> I I thus the fundamental rule is that one man has no right to put off his goods for sale as the goods of a rival trader and he cannot therefore be allowed to use names marks Ictlcrs or other indicia by which he is selling the manufacture of another person stated that the titles to books newspapers and periodicals lhough often coming before the courts on the question of copyright therein are not generally in themselves the proper subjects of this right that it is difficult to say that there is any original literary work in the formation of one or two words into a title and that the words into a little and that the words or phrase chosen may be original in their application to the subject matter of the work to which they arc applied In all these cases the plaintiff has to prove that his publication has been in the market long enough to acquire public reputation and secondly title used by the defendant is calculated to deceive the public <NAME> has on page given a large number of instances where injunctions in respect of title were granted or refused they were granted in The Wonderful Magazine The wonderful Magazine New Scries Improved Minne Minie Dale London Journal Daily London Journal etc A reference may also be made to a decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> Chancery Division In this case the plaintiffs were the publishers of a work instituted <ORG> Royal Modern Tutor for the Pianoforte a revised edition of which had been brought out in and which was well known and hsd an extensive sale but was not so registered as to secure copyright The court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction restraining the defendant from offering his work for sale with its present form title page and cover or any other form title page or cover calculated to deceive persons into the belief that it was the plaintiff work In these circumstances the court granted an injunction restraining the respondent from selling the whisky not blended by the petitioners in Dimple bottles for consumption in the United Kingdom It observed that action for infringement is a statutory right and it is dependent upon the validity of registration and other statutory conditions On the other hand the gist of passing off action is that A is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of It is enough that the get up of goods has beconic distinctive of them and there is a probability of confusion between them and she goods of A It is not necessary to prove actual deception or actual damage nor to prove the knowledge or intention to deceive The court laid down that issue in an action for passing off is whether the defendant is selling the goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead the purchaser to believe that they are the plaintiffs goods On tlic other hand the issue in infringement action is whether the defendant is using a mark which is the same or which is a colourable imitation of the plaintiffs registered mark pursuing it the plaintiff must prove his title and exclusive right to use the trade mark or work in question and further establish that the defendant has infringed the same by identical or deceptively similar or colourable imitation of it In such a case the defendant can escape the liability by showing that his goods or work though similar distinctly indicate that they do not originate from the plaintiff but have been produced by the defendant in the middle of the same page there is a reference to <NAME> of <NAME> and the name of the press Under the circumstances the counsel for the plaintiff appellants rightly submits that there is not the slightest doubt that he defendants have published their <ORG>s to deceive the public into belief that they are purchasing the <ORG> which had been published by the plaintiffs These would prima fade salish the ingredients of action for passing off and would show that the plaintiffs have a prima fade case and the learned Additional District Judge <NAME> erred in holding to the contrary There is a fallacy in the submission It can be legitimately said that this section has been inserted in the Act oi but the rule of law has been the same even prior to this statutory provision <NAME> has never claimed any copyright in the get up style design and title which would obviously be vesting in the publisher and nothing has been brought on record to show that <NAME> claimed any copyright in the design or get up or retained the same with him which could pass by inheritance Except as otherwise hereinafter provided copyright shall subsist in any literary dramatic musical or artistic work other than a photograph published within the lifetime of the author until fifty years from the beginning of the calendar year next following the year in which the author dies There is no doubt that if any calculations had been made by <NAME> second defendant he had a right to assign them to the plaintiff or to the defendants after the expiry of the said contract The considerations which must weigh with the court in granting or refusing the injunction arc well established It establishes that the balance of convenience lies in favor of the granting of injunction against the defendants Defendant No has stated that he has paid a substantial sum of money to defendant No in order to acquire the rights in the <NAME> The loss that the defendants may suffer is only the amount alleged to have been paid by defendant No to defendant No for acquisition of the rights the title and compilation which comes to Rs It may be mentioned that the observations made in this order are tentative and will not prejudice the trial of the suit on its merits according to law
