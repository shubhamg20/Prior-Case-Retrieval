<ORG> held that the suit was barred by limitation and dismissed it The appellants then came up in appeal by special leave It lay to recover money paid under a mistake or extorted from the plaintiff by duress of his goods or paid to the defendant on a consider ation which totally failed There is no doubt that the suit in the instant case is for refund of money paid by mistake and refusal to refund may result in unjust enrichment depending on the facts and circumstances of the case Though there is no constitutionally provided period of limitation for petitions under Article the limitation prescribed for such suits has been accepted as the guide line though little more latitude is available in the for mer For filing a writ petition to recover the money paid under a mis take of law the starting point of limitation is three years is prescribed by Article of the Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act and the provisions of of the Act will be applicable so that the period will begin to run from the date of knowledge of the particular law where under the money was paid being declared void and this could be the date of the judgment of a competent court declaring that law void The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This plaintiffs appeal by special leave is from the appellate Judgment of <ORG> dismissing the appeal upholding the Judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs suit on the ground of limitation The trial court taking the view that Articles and of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act were applicable and the period of limitation began to run from the dates the payments were made to the <ORG> held the suit to be barred by limi tation and dismissed it Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants submits inter alia that <ORG> erred in holding that the limitation started running from being the date of the letter Exhibit which was not communi cated to the appellants or any other contractor and there fore the appellants had no opportunity to know about it on that very date with reasonable diligence under and <ORG> ought to allow atleast a week for knowledge of it by the appellants in which case the suit would be within time Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respond ent submits inter alia that having been the date on which the <ORG> finally decided not to recover extra per cent above the auction money <ORG> rightly held that the limitation started from that date and the suit was clearly barred under Article or of the Schedule to the Limitation Act and that though the records did not show that the <ORG> decision was communicated to the appellants there was no reason why they with reasonable diligence could not have known about it on the same date The only question to be decided therefore is whether the decision of <ORG> is correct There is no dispute that per cent above the auction money was charged by <ORG> as mahua and fuel cess and <ORG> subsequently held that it had no power to do so There is no denial that the liquor contracts were performed by the appellants There is no escape from the conclusion that the extra per cent was charged by the <ORG> believing that it had power but <ORG> in two cases held that the power was not there There is therefore no doubt that the suit was for refund of money paid under mistake of law It lay to recover money paid under a mistake or extorted from the plaintiff by duress of his goods or paid to the defendant on a con sideration which totally tailed But it lies for money paid by mistake or upon a consideration which happens to fail or for money got through imposition express or implied or extortion or oppression or an undue advan tage taken of the plaintiff situation contrary to laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances Our law having been codified we have to apply the law There is no doubt that the instant suit is for refund of money paid by mistake and refusal to refund may result in unjust enrichment depending on the facts and circumstances of the case It may be said that this court has referred to unjust enrichment in cases under of the Contract Act The next question is whether and if so which provision of the Limitation Act will apply to such a suit Though there is no constitutionally provided period of limitation for petitions under Article the limitation prescribed for such suits has been accepted as the guideline though little more latitude is available in the former In <ORG> <NAME> AC where the appellant company in consideration of granting to the respondent a sub lease asked for and received from him a premium of Sh Had the appellants not paid this amount they would not have been given the contracts SCR the appellants paid certain amount to the <ORG> as excise duty and education cess for the years to in one case and from to in the other In Writ Petitions before <ORG> claiming refund the appellants contended that the payments in question were made by them under mis take of law that the mistake was discovered when <ORG> struck down the provisions as unconstitutional and the petitions were therefore in time but <ORG> dis missed them on the ground of inordinate delay It was held in <NAME> supra that although of the Contract Act has been held to cover cases of payment of money under a mistake of law as the <ORG> stands in a peculiar position in respect of taxes paid to it there are perhaps practical reasons for the law according different treatment both in the matter of the heads under which they could be recovered and the period of limitation for recovery In a case where payment has been made under a mistake of law as contrasted with a mistake of fact generally the mistake become known to the party only when a court makes a declaration as to the invalidity of the law In appeal to this Court <NAME> while dismissing the appeal held that money paid under a mistake of law comes within mistake in of the Contract Act there is no question of any estoppel when the mistake of law is common to both the assessee and taxing authority His Lordship observed that of the Limitation Act and Article of its First Schedule which prescribed a period of years were applicable to suits for refund of illegally collected tax A subsequent Act was also declared ultra vires by <ORG> on August against which the State of Assam and other respondents preferred appeals to <ORG> In November the appellant filed writ petition in the <ORG> contending that in view of the decision in <ORG> case he came to know about the mistake in paying tax as per assessment order and also that he became entitled to refund of the amount paid Allowing the assessee appeal <NAME> speaking for this Court held In this case indisputably it appears that tax was collected without the authority of law It appears that the assessment was made under section of the Act In the premises it is manifest that the respondents had no authority to retain the money collected with out the authority of law and as such the money was liable to refund of the Constitution the Court should have refused refund on ground of laches and delay the case of the appel lant having been that it was after the Judgment in the case of <ORG> the cause of action arose The Court observed Normally speaking in a society governed by rule of law taxes should be paid by citizens as soon as they are due in accordance with law Equally as a corollary of the said statement of law it follows that taxes col lected without the authority of law as in this case from a citizen should be refunded because no <ORG> has the right to receive or to retain taxes or monies realised from citizens without the authority of law There had been statement that the appellant came to know of that matter in October and there was no denial of the averment made It was accordingly held that the writ petition filed by the appellants were within the period of limitation prescribed under Art It is thus a settled law that in suit for refund of money paid by mistake of law of the Contract Act is applicable and the period of limitation is three years as prescribed by Article of the Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act and the provisions of of that Act will be applicable so that the period will begin to run from the date of knowledge of the particular law where under the money was paid being declared void and this court be the date of judgment of a competent court declaring that law void Mr <NAME> has fairly stated that there was nothing on record to show that the appellants knew about this letter on itself or within a reasonable time thereafter Again Mr <NAME> has not been in a position to show that the statement of the appellants that they knew about the mistake only after the judgment in <NAME> case reported in MPLJ in or about September whereafter they issued the notice under was untrue The appellants shall be entitled to the costs of this appeal
