Subsequently when certain vacancies arose in <ORG> due to selected candidates not joining the Service and only the reserved category vacancies were filled up by the candidates who had been earlier appointed in <ORG> Service the appellant who came to occupy top position represented to the authorities for filling the general vacancies also but his request was turned down In the appeal before this Court on behalf of the appellant it was contended that since ultimately several vacancies in the general category of the <ORG> remained unfilled he was entitled to be appointed in one of them that since vacancies were notified for general category and he was found qualified for the appointment the respondent could not refuse to fill up the vacancies and there was no justification to refuse to follow the procedure adopted in similar situation with respect to the reserved category in regard to the general category vacancies also and that in view of the relevant statutory rules the authorities were under a duty to continue with the process of filling up the vacancies until nonremained vacant and by keeping the posts unfilled they had acted arbitrarily On behalf of the respondent Union of India it was contended that the tentative service allocation for <ORG> was completed before the commencement of the foundational course for the <ORG> and the process of final service allocation was closed after filling up certain vacancies which had arisen since the process for recruitment for the next year had already started and hence the additional vacancies arising later remained unfilled that the process followed in connection with the reserved category was not followed in regard to the general category vacancies on account of vital differences obtaining in the relevant conditions in the two categories and hence there was no discrimination or arbitrariness in keeping the general category vacancies unfilled Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies The appellant had not acquired a right to be appointed against the vacancy arising later on the basis of any of the rules namely Rule of the <ORG>Cadre Rules Rules and of the <ORG>Recruitment Rules and Regulations a and and of the <ORG>Appointment by Competitive Examination Regulations The request was turned down and the appellant moved <ORG> by a writ application under Article of the Constitution which was dismissed in limine by the impugned order It has been contended that after calculating the number of vacancies in the <ORG> it was announced that appointments would be made in vacancies of general category and steps for recruitment were accordingly taken It has been argued that the correct procedure in similar situation was followed with respect to the reserved category and the three vacancies arising in identical situation were filled up from the candidates selected for DANIP Service and there was no justification to refuse similar benefit to the appellant in the general category Dealing with the appointments to reserved category it has been stated in the counter affidavit that the process which was followed in connection with the general category and which was being earlier followed for the reserved category also was relaxed in pursuance of a policy decision taken after examining all relevant circumstances and materials in regard to this category including the strength of the reserve category in the <ORG> the result of the examinations for the year and Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies They filed a writ petition before <ORG> claiming a right of being appointed on the ground that vacancies existed and they were qualified and were found suitable While reversing the decision of <ORG> it was observed by this Court that it was open to the Government to decide how MANY appointments should be made and although <ORG> had appreciated the position correctly it had somehow persuaded itself to spell out a right in the candidates because in fact there were vacancies The fact was that the matter had been referred to <ORG> which sent to the <ORG> only the names of candidates belonging to the general category on the assumption that only posts were to be filled up Mr <NAME> referred to several documents annexed to the special leave petition and affidavits filed on behalf of the parties and contended that although appointments of many candidates in the other services were made in the later vacancies the vacancy in <ORG> which subsequently became available to the appellant was refused without any just cause resulting in illegal discrimination We do not find any merit in this contention In the result we do not find any merit in the appeal which is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances without costs
