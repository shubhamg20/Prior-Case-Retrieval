The award was made a rule of court by a judgment dated Section of the Act of was rather restrictive in its operation and the use of the expression shall in the main body of the Section made it mandatory to the Court that the award of an Arbitrator shall not be set aside excepting for the reasons as mentioned therein namely a Arbitrator or Umpire has misconducted himself The award has been made or passed after the supersession of the Arbitration or the proceedings becoming invalid Award has been improperly procured or otherwise invalid These three specific provisions thus can only be taken recourse to in the matter of setting aside of award and the law is so well settled on this score that we also do not feel it expedient to dilate on the issue excepting recording that since the parties chose their own arbitrators to adjudicate the disputes between them the parties cannot object to such an adjudication or decision either upon the law or on the facts except however as envisaged in terms of Section of the Act of since repealed and as noticed above In the event however there are reasons interference would still be not available unless of vourse there exist a total perversity in the award or the judgment is based on a wrong proposition of law This <ORG> went on to record that in the event however two views are possible on question of law the court would not be justified in interfering with the award of the Arbitrator if the view taken recourse to is a possible view The observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> supra stands accepted and adopted by this <ORG> in <ORG> supra to the effect that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to investigate into the merits of the case or to examine the documentary and oral evidence in the record for the purposes of finding out whether or nor the Arbitrator has committed an error of law Railiaram SCR stated that right or wrong the decision of the Arbitrator is binding excepting in the case of error of law on the face of it or in the event the award itself or in a document actually incorporated in it there is found some legal proposition which stands out to be the basis of the award and which is erroneous <NAME> decision expressly records that the civil courts cannot exercise apparent power over the decision of an arbitrator wrong or right irrespective excepting however the situation noticed above In <NAME> and others <ORG> SCR it has also been laid down that it is not open to court to speculates where no reasons are given by the Arbitrator as to what impelled the Arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion and it is not open to the court to attempt to assess the mental process by which the Arbitrator has reached his conclusion where it is not disclosed by the terms of the award The record further depicts that the <ORG> on did pass the award which inter alia records the following I therefore do hereby award and determine that the respondents shall pay to the claimants a sum of Rs that the objection petition dated is hereby rejected and the Award is hereby made a rule of the court on contest with cost In paragraph of the judgment impugned before this Court <ORG> stated as below On a thoughtful consideration of the matter I reach the conclusion that it was not possible for the umpire in the given situation to award any amount at all to the plaintiff By reason of the above this Special Leave Petition has been filed wherein notices have been issued and the appeal is disposed of upon leave being granted as above Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing in support of the Appeal rather strongly contended that <ORG> in an appeal from the order of the st Subordinate Judge <NAME> in making the award the rule of court ought not to have interfered with the same neither High Court had any authority of jurisdiction to deal with the matter as it has been so done It is on this score that appellant herein placed strong reliance on the decision of this Court <NAME> case supra The respondent on the other hand with however equal vehemence and zest contended upon reliance on the judgment of this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh and <NAME> Rayamin <NAME> SCC that in the matter of challenging the award there are often two very distinct and separate grounds one being an error apparent on the face of the award and the other is that the Arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction whereas in the former the court can look into the agreement and upon consideration of the agreement the award can be set aside and in the latter the award can be set aside on the ground that the Arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction and the evidence starting on the face of the award will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceeded or not since the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined whatever might be said about it in the award by the Arbitrator The entire submission of the respondent is based upon the judgment in <NAME> supra <NAME> stated that only in a speaking award the court can look into the reasoning of the award and it is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the Arbitrator and speculate where no reasons are given by the Arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion vide paragraph of the judgment at page of the Report Relevance of the decision on the merits of the matter in the instant appeal would be dealt with immediately hereinafter but before so doingj it would be convenient to note the observations of this <ORG> in paragraph at page of the Report wherein it has been categorically stated that the <ORG> was concerned with clause a of Section of the Arbitration Act which empowers the courts to set aside an award on the ground that an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself or the proceedings this observation of the <ORG> itself takes put the relevancy of the decision in the matter since presently we are concerned with clause of Section of the Arbitration Act to wit otherwise invalid This is however apart from what is noticed hereinbelow as detailed submissions have been made relying upon the judgment of this court We may also state here that in the counter affidavit dated Filed by the present appellant before the teamed Sub Judge it had been clearly stated that the contract is evidenced by three integrated documents namely i tender dated ii work order dated and iii agreement dated Out of the claims under heads the arbitrator awarded amount under Claims and of the appellant Claimant right under the contract was purely personal it did not amount to an interest in the acres of land covered by the contract and he could not sue strangers in his own name in respect of that land it was his responsibility to settle all problems and objections which arose in the course of the mining work between him and his mining workers but not with strangers like kudikidappukars and the local public who claimed either rights in the land or rights and privileges against the respondent and it was the respondent duty to see that the entire extent of mining area detailed in the tender form was available or mining and mining operations could be carried on there quietly and without hindrance and whenever complaint regarding obstruction was received the respondent tried to discharge that duty by appealing to public authorities for help but without success and we need not dilate thereon in any farther detail suffice it to record that the decision in <NAME> does not have any manner of application both by reason of the observations of this <ORG> in paragraph of the Report as noticed above as also by reason of distinguishable factual feature as such the decision does not lend any support to the respondent herein Incidentally this Court in paragraph recorded the state of law as below But if he has remained inside the parameters of the contract arid has construed the provisions of the contract bis award cannot be interfered with unless he has given reasons for the award disclosing an error apparent on the face of it The exposition of law thus in <ORG> supra is in no way different and as a matter of fact travels alongwith the decision noticed hereinbefore in this judgment and not de hors the same metre of napa slab lining towards escalation in the cost of napa slabs and there was in fact no provision in the contract allowing escalation for napa slabs and it is on this score this Court came down heavily upon the authority of the arbitrator to direct payment of escalation charges when the agreement does not provide for the same Presently in the contextual facts there is no evidence on record that the umpire has overstepped his jurisdiction or has travelled beyond the agreement and it is in this perspective that the court ought not to have entertained the objection and set aside the award as passed by the chosen forum of the parties
