Alleging that the aforesaid <NAME> was junior to him the respondent <NAME> filed writ petition No of claiming promotion with effect from the date when <NAME> was promoted as Dy There being delay of days in filing the SLP the appellants have also filed Application being IA No seeking condonation of delay in filing the SLP It is submitted in the application that the order of <ORG> of <ORG> could not be challenged earlier allegedly due to the fear of contempt and various coercive orders passed by <ORG> against the <ORG> and its officials It is contended that the judgment impugned has been passed in violation of the provisions of law and the rules applicable and it has become a havoc in the <ORG> and <ORG> is facing great trouble in compliance of such type of directions for conferment of uncalled for benefits <NAME> respondent in the SLP of filed a writ petition in <ORG> praying for issuance of directions to the appellants to assign him seniority in the rank of Inspector of Police over <NAME> and thereafter provide him with all consequential benefits On the basis of the recommendations made by the Board a Gazette Notification is stated to have been issued on th October by which both the aforesaid respondents were promoted on officiating basis to the higher post of Inspector of Police It was however made clear that the judgment of the Court would not affect the interest of <NAME> in the matter of promotion to the post of Dy <NAME> and others who were intervenors in <ORG> filed an application with the submission that as they were likely to be adversely affected by the impugned judgment passed by the learned Single Judge and confirmed by the appellate Bench their interests be protected and the court should ensure by giving the benefit to the writ petitioners that the interest of the intervenors would not be adversely affected They have also sought the condonation of delay mainly on the ground of not being aware of the judgment passed by <ORG> which ultimately and eventually adversely affected their interests We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the parties and have perused the records JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ Appearing for the petitioners <NAME> Senior Advocate has submitted that under the circumstances of the case and for the reasons detailed in the applications sufficient grounds have been made out for condoning the delay in filing the petitions According to the learned counsel similar writ petitions and three contempt petitions are pending before <ORG> wherein all the petitioners have claimed similar relief as was given to <NAME> on the ground of admittedly being senior to him <NAME> is stated to have superseded Inspectors by getting an order to give him seniority with effect from SP <NAME> is stated to have superseded officers by virtue of the judgment of <ORG> in the second round claiming promotion as Dy No court can grant relief to a citizen by applying the concept of negative equality It is contended that in the absence of parties likely to be affected consequent upon the prayers made were necessary parties and in view of the fact that they have not been impleaded as party respondents the impugned judgments cannot adversely affect the interests of any senior officer There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately or on account of culpable negligence or on account of mala fides SCC held It is notorious and common knowledge that delay in more than per cent of the cases filed in this <ORG> be it by private party or the <ORG> are barred by limitation and this <ORG> generally adopts liberal approach in condonation of delay finding somewhat sufficient cause to decide the appeal on merits Considerable delay of procedural red tape in the process of their making decision is a common feature The court should decide the matters on merits unless the case is hopelessly without merit The <ORG> at appropriate level should constitute legal cells to examine the cases whether any legal principles are involved for decision by the courts or whether cases require adjustment and should authorise the officers to take a decision to give appropriate permission for settlement Looking into the facts and circumstances of the case as noticed earlier and with the object of doing substantial JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ justice to all the parties concerned we are of the opinion JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ that sufficient cause has been made out by the petitioners which has persuaded us to condone the delay in filing the petitions It is paramount consideration of this Court to safeguard the interests of all the litigants and persons serving the Police Department of the <ORG> of Bihar by ensuring the security of the tenure and non disturbance of accrual of rights upon them under the prevalent law and the rules made in that behalf Accordingly delay in filing the petitions is condoned The respondent <NAME> had filed Writ Petition No praying therein that he be given the same benefit as was given to the writ petitioners in Writ Petition No of The writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn on st July with the observation that however this shall not prejudice the petitioners in pursuing a remedy if any available to him or pursuing his representation which we are informed is pending with the State As his representation dated had not been considered <NAME> filed writ petition No of in which he prayed Under the above facts and circumstances it is therefore prayed that your lordships be graciously pleased to admit this application issue rule NISI and after both parties and there show causes if any allow this application by issuing a writ of directing the respondents to give promotion and other consequential benefits to the petitioner from the post of Inspector of Police to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police from the date the petitioner is found in legal entitle considering the case for promotion to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police by treating as confirmed Inspector of Police with effect from i the date of continuous officiation in the rank of Inspector of Police in the event of judgments and order passed by <ORG> relying on judgment of <ORG> contained in Annexure and of this writ application or pass such other order or orders as to your lordships may be pleased fit and proper Therefore his seniority in the rank of Inspector has to be reckoned with effect from The impugned order was quashed and a direction issued to the appellant to reckon the seniority of the writ petitioners in the rank of Inspectors with effect from with all consequential benefits as a result of revision of his seniority in the rank of Inspector as well as that of Dy He again filed writ petition No of submitting therein that having been confirmed to the lower post of Inspector of Police from st March his seniority should be counted from the date of confirmation i th October Apart from the aforesaid fact numerous decisions including the decision given by <ORG> as reported in AIR SC it has been held that the seniority of a person cannot be dependent on confirmation if confirmation itself is fortuitous in nature At least days before nominations are sent to the Deputy Inspector General the names of the nominees shall be published by the nominating authority in district orders so that those who are not nominated may have an opportunity of representing their cases before the nominations are actually submitted This list shall be of as many Sub Inspectors as there are vacancies plus few anticipatory vacancies depending on averages of last few years Rule deals with the out of turn JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ promotions and reads Selection Boards may recommend out of turn promotion of officers with outstanding records of service and competent authorities may order such promotion in deserving cases as they deem fit and proper with the approval of next higher authority Officers so promoted should be placed below the officers of the approved existing list of respective rank prepared by <ORG> and be confirmed against substantive vacancies as and when vacancies arise in the order of the list SCR held that to enable seniority to be counted from the date of initial appointment and not according to the date of promotion the incumbent of the post has to be initially appointed according to the rules Where the initial appointment is only adhoc and not according to the rules and made as a stop gap arrangements the officiation on such post cannot be taken into account for considering the seniority The corollary of the above rule is that where the initial appointment is only adhoc and not according to rules and made as a stop gap arrangement the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for considering the seniority When appointments are made from more than one source it is permissible to fix the ratio for recruitment from the different sources and if rules are framed in this regard they must ordinarily be followed strictly In case however the quota rule is not followed continuously for a number of years because it was impossible to do so the inference is irresistible that the quota rule had broken down Where the quota rule has broken down and the appointments are made from one source in excess of the quota but are made after following the procedure prescribed by the rules for the appointment the appointees should not be pushed down below the appointees from the other source inducted in the service at a later date Where the rule permits the authorities to relax the provisions relating to the quota ordinarily a presumption should be raised that there was such relaxation when there is a deviation from the quota rule There was therefore no justification of issuing the directions to direct the promotion of <NAME> while deciding the writ petition No of and dismissing the LPA No vide the judgment impugned in this appeal filed against <NAME> It appears that <ORG> totally lost sight of the fact that in his petitions filed from time to time <NAME> had not impleaded any of his seniors as party respondents In the absence of persons likely to be affected by the relief prayed for the writ petitions should have normally been dismissed unless there existed specific reasons for non impleadment of the affected persons In this background while I do not doubt the decisions given by this Court in different cases of respondent No <NAME> and while I do not doubt the consequential orders which have been issued by the respondents on the basis I hold that the petitioner cannot suffer for the same and he is entitled for seniority over the respondent No as Inspector of Police though not promoted while the Respondent No was granted officiating promotion by way of stop gap arrangement on th July Accordingly the respondents are directed to treat the petitioner as senior to the respondent No as Inspector of Police and provide him with the consequential benefit of the same including promotion to the next higher post if the petitioner is found fit for the same The appeal filed against this judgment was dismissed on the ground of delay and without consideration of the pleas raised on facts The Court observed Neither Article of the Constitution conceives within the equality clause this concept nor Article empowers <ORG> to enforce such claim of equality before law The respondent has no right whatsoever and cannot be given the relief wrongly given to them i benefit of withdrawal of resignation <ORG> was wholly wrong in reaching the conclusion that there was invidious discrimination As stated earlier his right must be founded upon enforceable right to entitle him to the equality treatment for enforcement thereof The aforesaid respondent is therefore not entitled to any relief as prayed for by him on the analogy of the judgments passed and directions given in <NAME> case We do not agree with the submissions of the respondents that the question of law raised by the appellants in regard to determination of seniority could not be permitted to be raised as allegedly the said point had not been pleaded before <ORG> and is altogether a new point taken for the first time in this Court As noticed earlier <ORG> had dismissed the LPAs only on the ground of limitation without deciding the other pleas raised by the appellants It was pleaded The petitioner was promoted to the rank of Inspector on adhoc basis with effect from and later on he was given officiating promotion from that very date i and was confirmed with effect from on the availability of permanent vacancy alongwith those Inspectors who were officiating on or before and promoted to the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police with effect from according to seniority When specific plea regarding facts and law had been raised in the LPA the arguments of the respondents cannot be accepted that such a plea had been raised by the appellant for the first time in this Court Such a plea by itself cannot be accepted as a ground to dismiss the appeal filed against an order which we have held to be illegal being contrary to law and the Service Rules applicable in the case Once the judgment is set aside the consequences have to follow and a person taking advantage or benefit of the wrong orders is to suffer for his own faults which cannot be attributed to anybody else It is however made clear that despite setting aside of the impugned judgments the service benefits conferred upon <NAME> consequent upon the judgments of <ORG> shall not be withdrawn and his appointment promotion in the <ORG> cadre not disturbed Parties to bear their own costs
