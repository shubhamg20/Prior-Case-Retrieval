In a suit filed by him against the <ORG> <ORG> passed a decree directing <ORG> to deliver the shares to him on payment of a certain sum and issued an injunction restraining <ORG> until delivery of the shares from exercising its rights as holder of those shares <ORG>hereafter the appellant another liquidator of the <ORG><ORG> <ORG> filed a complaint before the Chief Presidency Magistrate against respondents to the directors and Secretary of the <ORG><ORG><ORG> alleging that <NAME> and went to the office of <ORG><ORG><ORG> for obtaining the shares for delivering them to respondent that the second respondent delivered the shares to <NAME> that since <NAME> had a luncheon engagement he did not want to take them with him that the second respondent made the first endorsement on the receipt and <NAME> himself made the second endorsement to clarify why the shares were left with the second respondent that <NAME> took away the indemnity bond with him as the second respondent wanted the signature of the appellant also that later on that day the solicitors of <ORG> sent their assistant to the second respondent for the shares that the second respondent gave an assurance that he would send them through the solicitors of the <ORG><ORG><ORG> but did not do so that the second respondent was withholding the shares at the instance of the fifth respondent who was as a result of the injunction in a position to control the <ORG><ORG><ORG> without having to pay for the shares and was therefore interested in preventing <ORG> deliverng the shares to him and that respondents to were guilty of offences under ss and I <ORG>he second respondent filed a counter complaint against the appellant <NAME> and under ss and I <ORG>e alleged that the shares were always lying with the <ORG><ORG><ORG> as the <ORG><ORG><ORG> claimed a lien over them in respect of certain payments for income<ORG>tax purposes that the second respondent produced them before <NAME> for his inspection that he objected to the word received in the receipt and wanted instead the word inspected that <NAME> declined to alter the receipt and thereupon the second respondent wrote out the first endorsement with a view to clarify that the share certificates were still in his custody and not with the fifth respondent <ORG>he appellant thereupon filed objections and the Chief Presidency Magistrate directed a judicial enquiry into the complaint <ORG>he Magistrate who inquired into the matter reported to the Chief Presidency Magistrate that no prima facie case was made out in the complaint by the appellant but that a prima facie case was made out against the appellant <NAME> and In the course of the enquiry the appellant and and were examined as witnesses but <NAME> who was in was not examined In appeals to this Court allowing the appeal regarding the com<ORG>plaint by the appellant by the Majority and dismissing the appeal regarding the complaint against the appellant <ORG>he inquiry by the Magistrate envisaged at this stage is for ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint that is for ascertaining whether there is evidence in support of the complaint <ORG>he mere fact that the appellant did not examine him could not be a ground for throwing out the appellant complaint when there was other evidence making out a prima facie case It may be that much could be said on both sides but certainly this was not a case of there being no prima facie case or the evidence being so self<ORG>contradictory or intrinsically untrustworthy that process could properly be refused If the Magistrate after considering the statement on oath of the complainant and hiswitnesses and the result of the enquiry or investigation under the section is of the opinion that there is no sufficient cause for proceeding be may dismiss the complaint It is only if the two requirements are satisfied that no court can take cognizance of such an offence except on a complaint filed by such Court or a Court subordinate to it E<ORG>G i Section expressly states that an investigation ordered by a Magistrate would be an investigation made by a police officer in his statutory right under sub<ORG>sections and i It is only the copies of the receipt and the indemnity bond that were annexed to the affidavit in the execution proceeding that could be said to have been produced in proceedings before <ORG> and not the originals which were only shown to the Counsel of <ORG><ORG> <ORG> The curious result of the said induction was that <ORG> could get control and management of the company with the shares held by him without having to pay the price of the said shares until <ORG> gave delivery of all those shares out of which as aforesaid shares were in the custody of the company There was no dispute that the said endorsement and the signature underneath it were in the handwriting of <ORG> Later that day on the instructions of <ORG> <ORG> the Solictors of <ORG> sent their assistant one <NAME> with their own letter as also a letter addressed by <ORG> to <ORG> with a request to hand over to <NAME> those share certificates Since the said share certificates were not sent to them <ORG> by their letter dated August to the appellant recorded the fact of their having sent the said <NAME> to <ORG> the refusal of <ORG> to deliver the said share certificates to <NAME> and his assurance to hand them over through the Company solicitors and lastly of their having not received so far the said share certificates either from <ORG> or the Company solicitors This position appears to emerge from <ORG> letter dated November to the appellant In his deposition before the Magistrate the appellant pro duced the said receipt marked document and the said indemnity bond marked document and stated on oath that the receipt was in the handwriting of <NAME> that the words shares with me marked and the signature thereunder were in the handwriting of <NAME> and that the indemnity bond was in <NAME> handwriting and which he had given to the witness for his signature He also deposed that he had gone to <NAME> on that very day that is May with the receipt the said bondand a letter from <NAME> to <NAME> and had demanded from himthe said share certificates and had said at the time that he was agreeable to sign the said bond as the other liquidator of <ORG> that <NAME> thereupon showed the said sharecertificates to him and assured him that he would hand them overto <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> and that on that assurance he affixed his signature on the indemnity bond and told <NAME> that he would send his solicitors to take delivery of the said share certificates His evidence further was that thereafter he returned back to his hotel where <NAME> was waiting But his version as to what took place on May is avail able from his deposition in the counter complaint he lodged against <NAME> There is however no doubt that these share certificates were with the company on May for even according to affray when <ORG> saw him on that day complaining that the company had parted with those share certificates to <NAME> he produced them <ORG>fore <ORG> for his inspection The reasons he gave for his order were that though entrustment of share certificates was stated in para of the complaint it was no where stated that it was done on the strength of the receipt that the receipt was introduced in the case in a curious way in that it was brought on record by <NAME> who was not present either at the time when <NAME> wrote out the portion marked in the receipt or when he entrusted the said share certificates to <NAME> and that he <NAME> had very carefully avoided that issue in his statement and that though <NAME> had the opportunity to examine <NAME> he failed to do so There was accordingly no question of his avoiding the issue The issue between them was whether on May <NAME> and <NAME> had delivered them to <NAME> and whether <NAME> in his turn had handed them over to <NAME> personal custody to be returned to him later on that day Besides there was no question of the appellant having to explain how the said share certificates were in possession of Therefore these two circumstances the failure to explain which <ORG> characterised as the most unusual circumstances were on record and since the parties were not at issue on the first and the bond itself recited the reasons for its execution there was no question of the appellant and his witnesses having failed to explain them The object of such examination is to ascertain whether there is prima facie case against the person accused of the offence in the comptaint and to prevent the issue of process on a complaint which is either false or vexatious or intended only to harass such a person there is in his judgment no sufficient ground for proceeding to and held that he inquiry envisaged there is for ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint that is for ascertaining whether there is evidence in support of the complaint so as to justify the issue of process The first part lays down the materials which the magistrate must consider and the second part says that if after considering those materials there is in his judgment no sufficient ground for proceeding he may dismiss the complaint inquiry was set aside this Court laid down that the test was whether there was sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there was sufficient ground for conviction and observed that where there was prima facie evidence even though the person charged of an offence in the complaint might have a defence the matter had to be left to be decided by the appropriate form at the appropriate stage and issue of a process could not be refused As earlier stated there were before the Magistrate besides the evidence of the appellant and wit Over and above this there was the evidence of <NAME> who had gone to <ORG> to obtain the share certificates armed with <ORG> letter and the letter of <ORG> <NAME> Morgan which prima facie supported the case of entrustment In support of <ORG> order counsel for the respon dents argued that there was no reference of the receipt in the protest application dated May that likewise there was no reference therein of the indemnity bond that there were contradictions in the versions of <NAME> and <NAME> as to when the appellant signed that bond that the said share certificates were tinder attachment and therefore <ORG> was not likely to deliver them to <NAME> that <NAME> did not mention entrustment in his evidence that the letter of <NAME> to <ORG> said to have been carried by <NAME> when he went to take delivery of the said share certificates was not produced and lastly that though <NAME> had complained that the police had not given him an opportunity to examine <NAME> he failed to produce him before the Magistrate though he had both time and opportunity to do so In addition Mr <NAME> appearing for <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> argued that so far as <NAME> was concerned there was no evidence against him except the bare allegation of conspiracy that the indemnity bond intrinsically contradicted the case of delivery of the shares to <NAME> and their entrustment to <ORG> inasmuch as according to that document delivery was to be made to <ORG> and not to <NAME> and finally that the evidence at best showed that it was a case of promise to deliver and its breach and not one of entrustment and breach of trust Over and above these two documents there was the evidence of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> according to which the two documents were executed on May when <NAME> went to the Company office to obtain delivery of the said shares Despite that omission there was evidence both oral and documentary supported by contemporaneous letters of <ORG> demanding the said share certificates from <ORG> personally It may be that much could be said on both the sides Indeed both the Chief Presidency Magistrate and <ORG> founded their orders of dismissal mainly on the ground of omission to examine <NAME> without considering whether despite that omission there was other evidence on record which made out a sufficient ground for proceeding with the case He had therefore sufficient interest to say the least to bring about such a position that <ORG> would not be in a position to deliver the said shares and he could continue to have control if the company without owning the majority shares and without paying for them The evidence on record and the circumstances of the case would suggest that he probably changed his mind later on possibly at the instance of <NAME> who as aforesaid was interested in withholding the deliver of the said share certificates and handed them over to <NAME> instead of to <ORG> We mention these circumstances as possibilities only which might have to be considered at a later stage and not as our conclusions in these proceedings As regards respondent <NAME> Mr <NAME> drew our attention to an order dated April by which the <ORG> discharged the rule against him Mr <NAME> argued that no separate special leave petition having been filed against that order the appeal so far as <ORG> is concerned has to be dismissed There was therefore no necessity of a separate application for special leave against that order there was sufficient evidence before the Chief Presidency Magistrate which made out a prima facie case and even if much could be said on both the sides it was not a case of refusal of process On January the Magistrate reported that a prima facie case was made out and process should issue The only argument urged in <ORG> on behalf of <NAME> was that the complaint by <NAME> was barred under of the Code as the alleged forged document i the receipt had been produced in a judicial inquiry <ORG> turned down the contention holding that the receipt was produced by <NAME> in the course of inquiry by the police ordered in his complaint under of the Code and was then seized by them There was thus according to <ORG> no production of a fabricated document in a judicial proceeding the document having been long ago produced before and seized by the police before a judicial inquiry was held in that case The contention urged on behalf of <NAME> having thus been rejected Mr <NAME> thereupon urged two contentions that though it was true that <NAME> had produced the said receipt document before the police in the course of investigation by them ordered by the Chief Presidency Magistrate under of the Code in the matter of <NAME> complaint those proceedings before the police were part and parcel of the proceedings before the Chief Presi dency Magistrate and therefore production of the receipt there was production before the Magistrate that even before that the receipt had been produced before <ORG> and that having been done it was <ORG> alone who could cause a complaint to be filed under of the Code and not <NAME> provides no court shall shall take cognizance of any offence described in section or punishableunder section section or section of thesame Code when such offence is alleged to have beencommitted by a party to any proceeding in any <ORG> in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding except on the complaint in writing of such <ORG> or of some other <ORG> to which such <ORG> is subordinate If both those requirements are there then no court is to take cognizance of such an offence except on a complaint filed by such court or a court subordinate to it On the first limb of Mr <NAME> argument the question arises whether <NAME> can be said to have produced or tendered in evidence the said receipt before the Chief Presidency Magistrate there is no question that the receipt was ever tendered in evidence by <NAME> But the contention of Mr <NAME> was that though the receipt was not tendered in evidence it was nevertheless produced an expression which has a wide connotation expressly states that an investigation ordered by a Magistrate would be an investigation as above mentioned i an investigation made by a police officer in his statutory right under sub sections and Secondly it is well settled that before a Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance of an offences under a of the Code he must have not only applied his mind to the contents of the complaint presented before him but must have done so for the purpose of proceeding under and the provisions following that section But where he has applied his mind only for ordering an investigation under or issuing a warrant for purposes of investigation That clause in clear terms says that in respect of any of the offences enumerated there no cognizance can be taken of a private complaint when such offence is said to have been committed by a party to a proceeding in a court in respect of a document produced or tendered in evidence in that proceeding extent on a complaint by such court Cl in other words means that it is that court before which there is a proceeding and a party to such a proceeding is said to have committed an offence in respect of a document produced or tendered in evidence by him on whose complaint the offence can be taken cognizance of The police registered a case and after investigation submitted a report that it was a false case In the course of that enquiry the appellant examined four witnesses Reliance by <NAME> was also placed upon the following indemnity bond Indemnity Warranty Bond dated INDEMNITY WARRANTY In consideration of handing over the shares of <ORG> with blank transfers to <ORG> as per original letter of <ORG> dated the th December the Liquidators hereby indemnify <ORG> Calcutta that they will have no objection to be enjoined with the old Liquidators and the Executors of the deceased <NAME> for the claim of approximately Rs Mr <NAME> has contended in this Court on behalf of the appellant that there is prima faice case to show that hare scripts were handed over to <ORG> on May and thereafter were entrusted by <ORG> to <ORG> Reliance has then been placed by Mr <NAME> on the statement of <NAME> PW who is alleged to have accompanied <NAME> when the latter not <NAME> and <NAME> in the office of <ORG> on the morning of May On I went to the office of Mr <NAME> with Mr <NAME> He left them with accused No I to be sent through <ORG> The above statement of <NAME> in my opinion belies the stand taken by the appellant that the share scrips were delivered to <ORG> and he thereafter entrusted them to <ORG> The same remarks also apply to letter dated May sent by <ORG> to <ORG> What is significant however is that there was no reference in that letter to any entrustment of the share scrips Assuming for the sake of argument that the statement of <NAME> in the other case can be referred to in the present case the statement can be of no avail to the appellant because there is no indication in the statement of any entrustment of the share scrips The other person who was present at that time was <NAME> and the statement of <NAME> goes against the stand taken by the appellant about the delivery of share scrips to <ORG> and the entrustment of those share scrips thereafter to <ORG> There is nothing in the indemnity bond to show that the share scrips were handed over to <ORG> It seems that it was because of the non mention of the handing over of the share scrips to <ORG> in the indemnity bond that there was no reference to the said bond in the complaint filed by the appellant the complainant and his witnesses and the result of enquiry or investigation under section is of the opinion that there is no sufficient cause for proceeding he may for reasons to be recorded briefly dismiss the complaint If on the contrary the magistrate taking cognizance of the offence is of the opinion that there is sufficient cause for proceeding he should issue process against the accused in accordance with section of the Code In the present case the Presidency Magistrate the Chief Presidency Magistrate and the <ORG> took the view that there was no sufficient cause for proceeding on the complaint filed by the appellant No credible material has in my opinion been brought on record by the appellant as may show prima facie that there was entrustment of the share scrips in question to the accused ORDER In view of the majority judgment the appeal is allowed and <ORG> judgment and order is set aside
