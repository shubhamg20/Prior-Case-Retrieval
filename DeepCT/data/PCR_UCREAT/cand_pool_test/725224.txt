Their contention was that prize competition as defined in of the Act included not merely competitions that were of a gambling nature but also those in which success depended to a substantial degree on skill and the sections and the rules violated their fundamental right to carry on business and were unsupportable under Art The principle of severability is applicable to laws enacted by legislatures with limited powers of legislation such as those in <ORG> which fall partly within and partly outside their legislative competence where the question arises as to whether the valid can be separated from the invalid parts and that is a question which has to be decided by the <ORG> on a consideration of the entire provisions of the Act There is however no basis for the contention that the principle applies only when the legislature exceeds its powers as regards the subject matter of legislation and not when it contravenes any constitutional prohibitions JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos and of The petitioners before us are engaged in promoting and conducting prize competitions in different States of India and they have filed the present petitions under Art No person shall promote or conduct any prize competition or competitions in which the total value of the prize or prizes whether in cash or otherwise to be offered in any month exceeds one thousand rupees and in every prize competition the number of entries shall not exceed two thousand Section confers power on the State Governments to frame rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act In exercise of the powers conferred by this section <ORG> has framed rules for Part States and they have been in general adopted by all the States entries as they appear in the register in Form and ignore the remaining entries if any in cases where no entry fee is charged and refund the entry fee received in respect of the entries in excess of the first two thousand to the respective senders thereof in cases where an entry fee has been charged after deducting the cost if any of refund II and are wholly unworkable and would render it impossible to run the competition and that they seriously encroached on the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on business that they could not be supported under Art Mr <NAME> who appeared for the respondent disputes the correctness of these contentions and the question would have to be determined with reference to those competitions whether ss and and rr There is nothing in the wording of it which limits it to competitions in which success does not depend to any substantial extent on skill but on chance Now when a question arises as to the interpretation to be put on an enactment what the court has to do is to ascertain the intent of them that make it and that must of course be gathered from the words actually used in the statute To decide the true scope of the present Act therefore we must have regard to all such factors as can legitimately be taken into account in ascertaining the intention of the legislature such as the history of the legislation and the purposes thereof the mischief which it intended to Rep That Act was passed with the object of controlling and taxing lotteries and prize competitions within the Province of Bombay and as originally enacted it applied only to competitions conducted within the Province of Bombay In order to prevent evasion of the Act and for effectually carrying out its object the legislature of Bombay passed Act XXX of extending the provisions of the Act of to competitions conducted outside the State of Bombay but operating inside it the tax however being limited to the amounts remitted or due on the entries sent from the State of Bombay The validity of this enactment was impugned by a number of promoters of prize competitions in proceedings by way of writ in <ORG> and dealing with the contentions raised by them <NAME> and <NAME> who heard the appeals arising from those proceedings held that the competitions in question were gambling in character and that the licensing provisions were according valid but that the taxes imposed by ss and A of the Act were really taxes on the carrying on of the business of running prize competitions and were hit by Art Typical of such resolutions is the one passed by the legislature of Bombay which is in these terms This <ORG> do resolve that it is desirable that control and regulation of prize puzzle competitions and all other matters consequential and incidental thereto in so far as these matters are concerned with respect to which <ORG> has no power to make laws for the States should be regulated by <ORG> by law And if the State legislatures felt that there was any need to regulate even those competitions they could have themselves effectively done so without resort to the special jurisdiction under Art But Mr <NAME> contends and rightly that the <ORG>ary history of the enactment is not admissible to construe its meaning and Mr <NAME> also disclaims any intention on his part to use the statement of objects and reasons to explain and are void not merely in their application to the former as to which there is no dispute but also the latter Mr <NAME> contends that they are because he argues the rule as to severability of statutes can apply only when the impugned legislation is in excess of legislative competence as regards subjectmatter and not when it is in violation of constitutional prohibitions and further because the impugned provisions are one and indivisible The question whether a statute which is void in part is to be treated as void in toto or whether it is capable of enforcement as to that part which is valid is one which can arise only with reference to laws enacted by bodies which do not possess unlimited powers of legislation as for example the legislatures in <ORG> When a legislature whose authority is subject to limitations aforesaid enacts a law which is wholly in excess of its powers it is entirely void and must be completely ignored But where the legislation falls in part within the area allotted to it and in part outside it it is undoubtedly void as to the latter but does it on that account become necessarily void in its entirety The answer to this question must depend on whether what is valid could be separated from what is invalid and that is a question which has to be decided by the court on a consideration of the provisions of the Act It has also been applied by <ORG> in deciding on the validity of laws enacted by the legislatures of Australia and Canada <NAME> Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Australia <ORG> and Attorney General for Alberta Attorney General for Canada We must now examine the precise scope of these decisions In In re Hindu Women Rights to property Act the question arose with reference to the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act XVIII of It was held by <ORG> that <ORG> must on the principle laid down in <NAME> Attorney General for New South Wales be presumed to have known its own limitations and must be held to have intended to enact only laws within its competence that accordingly the word I property in Act No XVIII of must be construed as property other than agricultural land and that in that view the legislation was wholly intra vires That is true but that the principle of severability had the approval of that Court clearly appears from the following observations of Sir <NAME> It should not however be thought that the Court has overlooked cases cited to it in which the same words have been applied in an Act to a number of purposes some within and some without the power of the <ORG> and the whole Act hag been held to be bad If the restriction of thegeneral words to purposes within the power of the <ORG> would be to leave an Act with nothing or next to nothing in it or an Act different in kind and not merely in degree from an Act in which the general words were given the wider meaning then it is plain that the Act as a whole must be held invalid because in such circumstances it is impossible to assert with any confidence that the <ORG> intended the general words which it has used to be construed only in the narrower sense If the Act is to be upheld it must remain even when a narrower meaning is given to the general words an Act which is complete intelligible and valid and which can be executed by itself <NAME> Legislative and Executive Powers in Australia citing <NAME> Illinois There is nothing in these observations to Sections and of the Act imposed restrictions on the possession consumption and sale of liquor which had been defined in of the Act as including a spirits of wine methylated spirits wine beer toddy and all liquids consisting of or containing alcohol and any other intoxicating substance which the Provincial Government may by notification in the Official Gazette declare to be liquor for the purposes of this Act These items being thus treated separately by the legislature itself and being severable and it not being contended in view of the directive principles of State policy regarding prohibition that the restrictions imposed upon the right to possess or sell or buy or consume or use those categories of properties are unreasonable the impugned sections must be held valid so far as these categories are concerned It is argued for the petitioners that in that case the legislature had through the rules framed under the statute classified medicinal and toilet preparations as a separate category and had thus evinced an intention to treat them as severable that no similar classification had been made in the present Act and that therefore the decision in question does not help the respondent Dealing with the contention that a law authorising the imposition of a tax on sales must be declared to be wholly void because it was bad in part as transgressing constitutional limits the learned Chief Justice observed at It is a sound rule to extend severability to include separability in enforcement in such cases and we are of opinion that the principle should be applied in dealing with taxing statutes in this country The petitioners contend that the rule of severability in enforcement laid down in the above passage following the decision in <NAME> <ORG> is confined in American law to taxing statutes that it is really in the nature of an exception to the rule against severability of laws which are partially unconstitutional and that it has no application to the present statute Section of the Act had empowered the local Government to determine by notification the body or group of persons who are to be declared to be agricultural tribes for the purpose of the Act A notification dated April issued under that section provided that In each district of the Punjab mentioned in column I of the Schedule attached to this notification all persons either holding land or ordinarily residing in such district and belonging to any one of the tribes mentioned opposite the name of such district in column shall be deemed to be an agricultural tribe within the district The question was whether A was void as contravening of the Government of India Act which provided inter alia that no subject of His Majesty domiciled in India shall on grounds only of descent be prohibited from acquiring holding or disposing of property It was held by <ORG> that A was void as infringing to the extent that it prohibited alienation on ground of descent but that it was valid in so far as it related to a prohibition of the transaction in favour of a person who belonged to the tribe but did not hold land or ordinarily reside in the district as a prohibition on that ground was not within and that accordingly an enquiry should be made as to the validity of the impugned alienation with reference to the qualifications of the alienee There are no words in the Act capable of being so construed and such a course would in effect involve an amendment of the Act by the court course which is beyond the competency of the court as has long been well established It will be noticed that in the above case there was no question of the application of the Act to different categories which were distinct and severable either in fact or under the provisions of the Act on a question which was also raised in that case whether A which avoided the alienations made both before and after the Act having been held to be void in so far as it was retrospective was void in toto If the retrospective element were not severable from the rest of the provisions it is established beyond controversy that the whole Act would have to be declared ultra vires and void Subsequent to the enactment of this statute the Constitution came into force and the validity of the impugned provision depended on whether it was protected by Art which saved existing law in so far as it relates to any matter which undermines the security It was held by this Court that as the purposes mentioned in A of the Madras Act were wider in amplitude than those specified in Art This Court held that the restrictions imposed by were in excess of what was requisite for achieving the purpose of the Act which was to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas that that purpose could have been achieved by limiting the restrictions to agricultural labour and to defined hours and that as it stood the impugned provision could not be upheld as a reasonable restriction within Art The observation aforesaid must be read in the context of the particular provision which was under consideration Even when the provisions which are valid are distinct and separate from those which are invalid if they all form part of a single scheme which is intended to be operative as a whole then also the invalidity of a part will result in the failure of the whole In the result both the contentions must be found against the petitioners and these petitions must be dismissed with costs
