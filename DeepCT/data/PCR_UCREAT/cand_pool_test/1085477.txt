The question referred by <ORG> Bangalore Bench for the opinion of this court at the instance of the assessee is this Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that in computing the actual cost for the purpose of calculating development rebate under Section no upward adjustment of Rs which alone according to him represented the development rebate on the actual cost of the imported ships on the ground that while Section A of the I Act provides for extra depreciation allowance on account of the effect of devaluation there is no provision in the Act for allowing development rebate on the increased liability arising out of devaluation and Section A expressly forbids such a provision in the year in which a reserve is created in view of the fact that in the year in question there was a loss The <ORG> was of the view that Section A applies where as a result of the change in the exchange rate there is an increase or reduction in the liability of the assessee in terms of the rupee to pay the price of any asset in foreign currency or to repay monies borrowed in foreign currency specially for the purpose of acquiring the asset and that the section does not apply unless i the asset is acquired and ii the liability existed before the change in the exchange rate took effect that Section A restricts the allowance to depreciation etc The submission made on behalf of the assessee before the <ORG> was that even apart from Section A on general principles extra liability incurred in respect of the capital assets has to be added to the cost of the assets The agreement dated August between the foreign ship building yard which built the two ships and the assessee provided for payment of per cent The <ORG> held that the increased liability to the consortium of the West German banks due to devaluation of the rupee which took place after the two vessels had been acquired by the assessee cannot be considered to be indirect expenditure laid out for the purpose of acquiring the assets and that though the actual cost of the ships would include the excess payable due to the devaluation of the rupee there is a specific prohibition in Section A of the Act against adopting the adjusted actual cost due to the devaluation for the purpose of development rebate allowable under Section of the Act and accordingly dismissed the appeal of the total cost of the two ships had been paid by the assessee to the foreign ship building yard by the date of signing the agreement entered into between the foreign ship building yard and the assessee on th August and credit for the balance of per cent The additional liability as a result of the devaluation had accrued to the assessee which had to discharge its debt to the consortium of West German banks incurred before the date of the devaluation for the purpose of acquiring the ships It was conceded by the learned counsel for the revenue that on general principles the additional liability arising out of the devaluation of the rupee would become part of the cost of the ships as it had been done by the assessee in revising the cost of the fleet in the balance sheet as at December as Rs Our attention was drawn to the decision of a Bench of this court in Addl ITR Mad where the assessee claim for development rebate was based on the fact that the actual cost of the machinery had increased by Rs The learned counsel for the assessee invited our attention to the decision of a Bench of <ORG> in I Ref The learned judges answered that question in favour of the assessee This decision also will not apply to the facts of the present case for in that case the increased liability on account of devaluation was within the contemplation of the parties as an integral part of the original transaction and it was held by the learned judges that the assessee must be held to have incurred such liability in respect of each instalment no sooner it started drawing upon the loan account since the assessee maintained its accounts according to the mercantile system Section a provides that in respect of a new ship which is owned by the assessee and is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by him there shall in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section and of Section be allowed a deduction in respect of the previous year in which the ship was acquired a sum by way of development rebate as specified in Clause Section A lays down that Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act where an assessee has acquired any asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession and in consequence of a change in the rate of exchange at any time after the acquisition of such asset there is an increase or reduction in the liability of the assessee as expressed in Indian currency for making payment towards the whole or a part of the cost of the asset or for repayment of the whole or a part of the moneys borrowed by him from any person directly or indirectly in any foreign currency specifically for the purpose of acquiring the asset being in either case the liability existing immediately before the date on which the change in the rate of exchange takes effect the amount by which the liability aforesaid is so increased or reduced during the previous year shall be added to or as the case may be deducted from the actual cost of the asset as defined in Clause of section or the amount of expenditure of a capital nature referred to in Clause iv of Sub section of section or in Section A or in Clause ix of Sub section of Section or in the case of a capital asset not being a capital asset referred to in Section the cost of acquisition thereof for the purposes of Section and the amount arrived at after such addition or deduction shall be taken to be the actual cost of the asset or the amount of expenditure of a capital nature or as the case may be the cost of acquisition of the capital asset as aforesaid The Sub section restricts the effect of devaluation to the expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business carried on by the assessee covered by Section iv expenditure on acquisition of patent rights or copyrights covered by Section A expenditure bona fide incurred by a company for the purpose of promoting family planning amongst its employees covered by Section ix and capital asset not being a capital asset referred to in Section the cost of acquisition thereof for the purpose of Section The assessee will pay the costs of the revenue
