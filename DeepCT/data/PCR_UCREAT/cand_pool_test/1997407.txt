The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal which has come before us on special leave is directed against a judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> dated the th May by which the learned Judges dismissed an appeal taken against an order made by a single Judge on the Original Side of that Court under clause of the Letters Patent on the preliminary ground that the appeal was not competent in law There is no dispute about the material facts of the case which lie with in a short compass On th August a suit was filed by the respondent <NAME> in <ORG> at Jalpaiguri in West Bengal being Title Suit No of for recovery of possession of a large estate known as Baikunthapur Raj situated in that district on the allegation that he being the eldest son of late <NAME> the last holder of the estate became entitled to the properties on the I death of his father under a custom of the family which excludes all females from inheritance and follows the rule of Iineal primogeniture in matters of succession There was no son born to her and her only child is a daughter named <NAME> <NAME> it is alleged took possession of the bulk of the properties comprised in the estate on the death of her husband although she had no legal right to the same and it was to evict her from these properties that this suit was brought <NAME> filed her written statement on January and the main defence put forward by her was that there was no legal marriage between her husband and the plaintiff mother the latter being only one of the several mistresses of her husband She denied that there was any custom in the family under which females were excluded from inheritance The defendants to also filed written statements challenging the legitimacy of the plaintiff and his claim to succession and put forward their own rights as heirs under the customary law obtaining in the family This application was heard by <NAME> sitting singly and by his order dated the th of April the learned Judge allowed the application substantially on the ground that having regard to the atmosphere of prejudice that was created in the locality by supporters of the defendant who wielded considerable influence in the district the plaintiff might have a legitimate apprehension that he would not get fair trial in the district court <ORG> in holding the appeal before it to be incompetent based its decision entirely upon an earlier pronouncement of a Division Bench of the same court where it was held by <NAME> sitting with <NAME> that an order for transfer of a suit made under clause of the Letters Patent was not a judgment within the meaning of clause Reliance was placed by the learned Judges for this view upon the pronouncement of Sir <NAME> in the well known and often cited case of <NAME> for Calcutta <ORG> where the learned Chief Justice said as follows We think that judgment in clause means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability In other words judgment is not what is defined in section of the Civil Procedure Code as being the statement given by the judge of the grounds of a decree <NAME> <NAME> Rang A final judgment is an adjudication which conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all matters in issue in the suit whereas a preliminary or interlocutory judgment is a decree by which the right to the relief claimed in the suit is decided but under which further proceedings are necessary before a suit in its entirety can be disposed of In this view an order for transferring a suit from a subordinate court to <ORG> could not possibly be regarded as a judgment and consequently no appeal would lie against such an order <NAME> as said already defined judgment be a decision which determines some right or liability affecting the merits of the controversy between the parties This will be apparent from the following observations made by <NAME> in the course of his judgment in the case referred to above It is however said that this court has already put a wider construction upon the word I judgment in clause by entertaining appeals in cases where the plaint has been rejected as insufficient or as showing that the claim is barred by limitation and also in cases where orders have been made in execution For example there is an obvious difference between an order for the admission of a plaint and an order for its rejection It certainly involves the determination of some right or liability though it may not be necessary that there must be a decision on the merits According to <NAME> to find out whether an order is a I judgment or not we have to look to its effect upon the particular suit or proceeding in which it is made As this definition covers not only decisions in suits or actions but orders in other proceedings as well which start with applications it may be said that any final order passed on an application in the course of a suit granting or refusing a party prayer for adjournment of a suit or for examination of a witness would also come within the definition It is true that unless the parties to the suit are agreed on this point there must arise a controversy between them which has to be determined by the court An order for transfer cannot be placed in the same category as an order rejecting a plaint or one dismissing a suit on a preliminary ground as has been referred to by <NAME> in his observations quoted above An order directing a plaint to be rejected or taken off the file amounts to a final disposal of the suit so far as the court making the order is concerned On the other hand an order of transfer under clause of the Letters Patent is in the first place not at all an order made by the court in which the suit is pending <ORG> that an order refusing to rescind leave to sue granted under clause of the Letters Patent was a judgment under clause and could be challenged by way of appeal This decision was followed by <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> and it is argued by Mr <NAME> that there is no difference in principle between an order of that description and an order transferring a suit under clause of the Letters Patent In our opinion this reasoning is not sound and there is an essential difference between an order rescinding or refusing to rescind leave to sue granted under clause of the Letters Patent and one removing a suit from a subordinate court to <ORG> under clause of the Letters Patent and this distinction would be apparent from the observations of Sir <NAME> in the Madras <ORG> case mentioned above to which sufficient attention does not appear to have been paid by the learned Judges of the same court who decided the later case Referring to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> observed as follows As regards the Bombay authorities I may refer to <NAME> Camaji where it was held that an appeal lay from an order dismissing a Judge summons to show cause why leave granted under clause of the Letters Patent should not be rescinded and the plaint taken off the file So also would an order made under an application to revoke a submission to arbitration Leave granted under clause of the Letters Patent constitutes the very foundation of the suit which is instituted on its basis <NAME> suit automatically comes to an end and there is no doubt that such an order would be a judgment If on the other hand an order is made dismissing the Judge summons to show cause why the leave should not be rescinded the result is as Sir <NAME> pointed out that a decision on a vital point adverse to the defendant which goes to the very root of the suit becomes final and decisive against him so far as the court making the order is concerned It is enough for our purpose to state that there is a difference between ail order refusing to rescind leave granted under clause of the Letters Patent and one under clause directing the removal of a suit from one court to another and there is no good reason to hold that the principle applicable to one applies to the other also
