The system in force for the collection of tobacco revenue was to auction what were called A class and class shops On April after the Constitution of India had come into force and Travancore cochin had become a Part State thereunder by of the Finance Act the central Excises and Salt Act was ex tended to that State there is in force in any State other than Jammu and Kashmir a law correspo nding to but other than an Act referred to in sub or of such law is repealed with effect from the said date After this provision in the Finance Act the Rules which were in force on April were changed in the <NAME> area by a notification dated August and the system of auction sales of A Class and Class shops was done away with and instead graded licence fees were introduced for various classes of licensees Similar change was made for the Travancore area by notification dated January The appellants who were carrying on business in tobacco within the territories of Travancore and <NAME> challenged the legal its of the notifications of August and January on the ground that the <NAME> Tobacco Act and the Travancore Tobacco Regulation under which the notifications were purported to be issued were law corresponding to the Central Excises and Salt Act and so they stood repealed from April by virtue of the operation of ss and of the Finance Act It was contended for the State of Kerala that the main feature of the Central Excise and Salt Act was the imposition of a duty of excise on goods produced or manufactured in India and that there was no provision for charging duty in the <NAME> Act or the similar Travancore Act and therefore all these provisions in the Rules for the control of tobacco from the time of cultivation to the time of the final stage of sale to the consumer even though they were similar to the Rules under the Central Act would not make the <NAME> Act or the similar Travancore Act a law corresponding to the Central Act Held that the rules framed under the <NAME> Tobacco Act of and the Travancore Tobacco Regulation of requiring licences to be taken out for storage and sale of tobacco and for payment of licence fee in respect thereof were law corresponding to the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act and hence were superseded on April by virtue of of the Finance Act consequently the new Rules framed in August and January for the respective areas of <NAME> and the respective areas of <NAME> and Travancore for the issue of license and payment of fee therefore for storage of tobacco were invalid ab initio The fact that this system was used instead of the system of charging of duty as provided in of the Central Excise and Salt Act would not make any difference to the nature of the impost the income from auctions was in the nature of excise duty WANCHOO These five appeals on certificates granted by <ORG> raise a common question of law and will be dealt with together As the facts laws and rules in the two areas are similar we propose to deal in detail with the appeals from the Cochin area section of the Act gave power to the <ORG> to make rules from time to time consistent with the Act to permit Reference may however be made to which provided that no action shall lie against the sirkar or against any officer of <ORG> for damages in any civil court for any act bona fide done or ordered to be done in pursuance of this Act or of any law for the time being in force relating to tobacco revenue Rule provided that the licensed manufacturer and the storehouse keeper would sell or otherwise dispose of his stock only to licensed dealers and there was prohibition against the disposal or sale of tobacco to any person who had not the required license to possess the same In addition to these Rules there were further Rules also framed under the Cochin Act with respect to import of tobacco into the State and all import was prohibited except under the provisions of the Diwan notification describing the sale of tobacco shops and licences It further appears that the system in force for the collection of tobacco revenue up to August was to auction what were called A class and class shops and the last of such auction was held under the notification dated May In addition there were a class shops the licence for which was granted either on the recommendation or in consultation with class licensees at the discretion of the <ORG> Commissioner or any other officer authorised by him on payment of the prescribed fee On April after the Constitution had come into force and Travancore Cochin has become a Part State thereunder the Finance Act No XXV of extended the Central Excises and Salt Act No of hereinafter called the Central Act to the Part State of Travancore Cochin by thereof Section of the Finance Act further provided that if immediately before the st day of April there is in force in any State other than Jammu and Kashmir a law corresponding to but other than an Act referred to in sub or of such law is hereby repealed with effect from the said date It seems that in consequence of this provision in the Finance Act the rules which were in force on April were changed in the Cochin area by a notification dated August and the system of auction sales of A clause and shops was done away with and instead graded licence fees were introduced for various classes of licensees including class licensees Similar change was made for the Travancore area by notification dated January The appellants of Cochin area were tobacco dealers and holders at the time they filed their petitions in of A class licences The main contention raised on their behalf in their petitions was that the Cochin Act stood repealed by the Finance Act on the introduction of the Central Act in the part <ORG> of Travancore Cochin from April in consequence the notification which was issued on August or on January framing new Rules for the issue of licences and prescribing rules therefor under the powers conferred under the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act were ab initio void because the Acts under which the notifications were purported to be issued stood repealed from April In addition various other grounds were raised challenging the validity of the new Rules which however we do not think it necessary for the purposes of these appeals to set out here The petitions were opposed on behalf of the <ORG> and it was contended that the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act did not stand repealed from April In consequence it was urged that the <ORG> was competent to frame new Rules which it did under the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act <ORG> dismissed the petitions holding that the laws under which the new Rules were framed were in force and were justifiable under item of List II of the Seventh Schedule Unfortunately though the judgment of the High court mentions the contention of the appellants that on the extension of the Central Act with effect from April by the Finance Act the Cochin Act as well as the similar Travancore Act ceased to be operative from that date there is no discussion in the judgment with regard to this contention and <ORG> did not consider whether in view of of the Finance Act the Cochin Act as well as the similar Travancore Act stood repealed from April that where the Act repealed provides substantially for all matters contained in the Act effecting the repeal there is correspondence between the two Acts and the earlier Act would thus stand repealed it is not necessary that there should be complete identity between the repealing Act and the Act repealed in every respect Therefore when of the Finance Act provides that on the extension of the Central Act from April to the Part State of Travancore Cochin any law corresponding to the Central Act is repealed with effect from that date all that we have to see whether the law repealed substantially provided for the same matters as the Central Act even though it may not be identical in all respects the constitution and such duty of excise is a duty on goods manufactured or produced in India Thus according to the respondent the main feature of the Central Act is the imposition of a tax on goods produced or manufactured in India and unless the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act also imposes a tax on goods produced or manufactured in what was formerly Cochin or Travancore State these would be no question of correspondence between the Central Act and the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act In the first case it was held that the primary meaning of excise duty was of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the taxing country see It was also observed in that case that it could not be denied that laws were to be found which impose a duty of excise at stages subsequent to the manufactures or production It may therefore be accepted that a duty of excise is a tax on goods produced or manufactured in the taking country though it cannot be denied that laws are to be found which impose a duty of excise at stages subsequent to the manufacture or production We cannot however forget that the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act was passed by State in which there were no such Constitutional provisions as are to be found in the Government of India Act and it legislative Lists and this aspect will have to be borne in mind when judging the question of correspondence between the Central Act and the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act Now the Central Act provides by for the levy and collection of duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and also a duty on salt manufactured in or imported by land into any part of India Further of the central Act gives power to the central Government to issue licences and prohibits any person from engaging in the wholesale purchase or also whether on his own account or as a broker or commission agent or the storage of any excisable goods except under the authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence granted under the Central Act The method of realising duty must be left to the wisdom of the legislature taking each individual trade and its peculiarities and difficulties which arise in that matter Thus in order to levy excise duty under the Central Act there are provisions in the Rules which start in the case of tobacco from the stage of cultivation and continue right up to the time the finished product reaches the hand of the retailer and thus becomes a part of the commons stock for purposes of sale to the consumers Further if one looks at the Rules under the similar Travancore Act in vol II of the Travancore Excise Manual which were in force on A April in relation to tobacco it will be found that there are elaborate rules in Part III from pp Further there are rules at for cultivation curing and warehousing It will thus be clear that the Cochin as well as the Travancore Rules provided for similar central of tobacco as under the Central Act and show that the authorities in Travancore and Cochin were also on the track of the movement of tobacco from the time it was grown and manufactured to the time it was sold in the market But it is urged on behalf of the <ORG> that there is no provision for charging duty in the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act and therefore all these provisions in the Rules for control from the time of cultivation to the time of the final stage of sale to the consumer even though they are similar to the Rules under the Central Act would not make the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act a corresponding Act to the Central Act There is no doubt that there is no provision corresponding to of the Central Act in the Cochin Act or in the similar Travancore Act Under the Cochin Act the tax was levied by virtue of the power conferred on the <NAME> under to make rules for the purpose Under the similar Travancore Act the provision is contained in which provides that the <NAME> may with the sanction of the ruler make rules permitting absolutely or subject to the payment of any duty or fee or to any other conditions and regulating within the whole or any specified part of Travancore the cultivation manufacture possession transport import and sale of tobacco In essence therefore the provision for charging the tax was made in the Rules We have already indicated that the essence of the duty of excise as held by <ORG> and <ORG> is that it is a duty on the goods manufactured or produced in the taxing country Further as generally the duty is on the goods produced or manufactured it is paid by the producer or manufacturer though as in the case of all indirect taxes it is passed on eventually to the consumer in the shape of being included in the price and is thus really borne by the consumer Further the cases on which reliance bas been placed on behalf of the <ORG> also show that laws are to be found which impose duty of excise at stages subsequent to manufacture or production It is also obvious that this system of auction is not a system of levying sales tax because it has nothing to do with the levy on each sale which is the essence of a sales tax The fact therefore that this system was used instead of the system of charging of duty as provided in of the Central Act would not in our opinion make any difference to the nature of the impost which was in force on the relevant date namely April However there is no way of differentiating this part of the revenue from the rest and considering the elaborate provisions as to the control of tobacco trade from the grower right up to the time that the goods were sold to the public in retail sale it would in our opinion be not unreasonable to hold that the Cochin Act as well as the Travancore Act was in substance an Act corresponding to the Central Act The <NAME> Act did not refer to manufacture in the Act itself though there was provision for manufacture in the Rules framed under the Act What applies therefore to the <NAME> Act and the Rules framed thereunder applies in force to the Travancore Act and the Rules framed thereunder and there is no doubt that the Travancore Act and the Rules framed thereunder were also a law corresponding to the Central Act and the Rules framed thereunder There would thus be no law to support the Rules framed by the State Government in January and therefore the Rules must fall So it Was urged on behalf of the State that this Court should not grant a mere declaration as to the invalidity of the Rules when they are no longer in existence This argument in our opinion has no force because we must look to the situation as it was when the petitions were presented We therefore allow the appeals and set aside the order of <ORG> The petitions are allowed and it is hereby declared that the new Rules purporting to be framed either under the cochin Act or under the Travancore Act in August and thereafter in January were invalid ab initio and have no force and effect The appellants will get their costs from the <ORG> one set of hearing costs <NAME> In this group of five appeals the principal question which falls to be determined is whether within the meaning of a of the Finance Act which by thereof extended the Central Excise Salt Act I of to the Part <ORG>s there was immediately before the st of April in force in Part <ORG> of Travancore Cochin a law Corresponding to the Central Excise Salt Act It is common ground that if there was such a law in force by virtue of of the Finance Act of that law stood repealed of were carrying of the former state of Cochin In the Territory of the former <ORG> of Travancore there was in force the Travancore Tobacco Regulation I of Travancore in By Chapter III of the Act power was conferred upon the officers of <ORG> to search house suspected to contain tobacco and provision was made for incidental matters Chapter IV dealt with offences and punishments and by the Diwan of the <ORG> was authorised with the sanction of the Ruler from time to time by Notification in Gazette to make rules consistent with the Act amongst other subject permitting absolutely or subject to the payment of any duty or fee or to any other conditions and regulating within the whole or to any other conditions and regulating within the whole or any specified part of the <ORG> of Travancore cultivation manufacture possession transportation import and sale of tobacco authorising the establishment of warehouses or bankshalls for storing tobacco legally cultivated or imported into the territory fixing the mode time and place of levy of duty regulating the special custody of tobacco warehoused and the levy of fees for warehousing and transport and generally to carry out the provisions of the Act Rules were framed in in exercise of the powers under of the Tobacco Act whereby restrictions were imposed upon the import and export of tobacco and provision was made for bonding tobacco in warehouses and for the issue of licences for bonding tobacco By of Finance Act of certain Acts including the Central Excises Salt Act of and all Rules and orders made thereunder in force from time to time before the commencement of the Finance Act were extended with effect from April to the part States except the State of Jammu Kashmir It was provided by that if immediately before the st of April there was in force in any State other than Jammu Kashmir a law corresponding to but other than the Act referred to in sub such law shall stand repealed with effect from the said date These Rules were issued on January in purported exercise of the powers conferred by the Travancore Regulation I of and the Cochin Tobacco Act of Rule which is common to both the sets of Rules provides that the vend of tobacco of all kinds is prohibited throughout the state except under a licence They claimed that they were not liable to pay licence fee under the Rules framed in because there was absolute delegation of legislative power by the Rules that the levy infringed their fundamental rights under Arts <ORG> in the petitions for writs of mandamus and other writs negatived the contentions raised by the appellants that the Acts and the Rules amounted absolute delegation of legislative power or that the fundamental rights under Arts The expression corresponding does not postulate identity of the State Law and the statute extended by of the Finance Act if there was in force at the material time law in the Part State dealing with a particular subject matter and the law extended by of the Finance Act dealt with the same subject matter and the two laws though not identical still were such that if they stood together there would have been legislative duplication or overlapping the law in force in Part State would be regarded as corresponding to the law extended by the Indian Finance Act and hence repealed by the operation of Let us examine the scheme of the Central Excises and Salt Act of for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Travancore and the Cochin Tobacco Acts and Rules frame thereunder are law corresponding to the Central Excises and Salt Act wholly or partially The Central Excises and Salt Act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to Central duties of excise on goods manufactured or produced in certain parts of India and to salt The expression excisable goods is defined in as meaning goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt By it is provided that there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and at the rates set forth in the First Schedule By certain incidental operations are made subject to licence and it is provided The Central Government may by notification in Official Gazette provide that from such date as may be specified in the notification no person shall except under the authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence granted under this Act engage in a the production or manufacture of any specified goods included in the First schedule or of saltpetre or of any specified component parts or ingredients of such goods or of specified containers of any specified excisable goods or the wholesale purchase or sale whether on his own account or as a broker or commission agent or the storage of any excisable goods specified in this behalf in Part A of the Second Schedule By virtue of these provisions power is conferred upon <ORG> to impose restrictions upon the rights to produce manufacture and to engage in any process of production or manufacture of the excisable goods or in the wholesale purchase or sale of excisable goods this power is conferred indisputably as ancillary to enforcing the law enacted for the levy and collection of excise duty By Chapter III power to arrest and to summon persons to give evidence or produce documents in inquiries under the Act to search and the procedure to be followed by officers in charge of police stations inquiries to be made by <ORG> against arrested persons forwarded to them are made By the st clause it provides that every person desiring to engage in operations requiring the possession of a licence aforesaid shall apply in writing every year for a licence or renewal thereof to the licensing authority who shall be such officer as <ORG> may authorise in this behalf Rule prescribes Forms application for licences and cl provides that every such application for licence shall where a fee is prescribed in the subjoined Table be accompanied by a Central Excise Revenue Stamp showing payment of such fee under item No in the Table a wholesale dealer in unmanufactured tobacco who purchases for the purpose of trade or manufacture the to pay graded fee set out in the second and the third columns Rule provides for the Forms of licence But on that account it cannot be said that the provisions relating to the requirement of licences and the payment of licence fees for storage of tobacco for sale under the Travancore and the Cochin Acts were not provision corresponding to the provisions of under the Central Excises and Salt Act and the rules framed under the Act requiring that licences shall be taken out for storage of tobacco for sale and fee shall be paid in respect thereof In my judgment the relevant rules made under the Travancore and the Cochin Tobacco Acts requiring licences to be taken for storage of tobacco and in force on April were law corresponding to the provisions of the Central Excise and Salt Act and the rules framed thereunder which required licences to be taken out for storage of tobacco and for payment of licence fee in respect thereof and to that extent the provisions imposing an obligation to take out licences and to pay licence fees under the Tobacco Act of Travancor and the Cochin States were superseded and the State of Travancore Cochin had no authority to promulgate rules and under the Notification issued in <ORG> dated January and to levy licence fee for storage of tobacco For these reasons I agree that the appeals be allowed and the order passed by <ORG> be set aside
