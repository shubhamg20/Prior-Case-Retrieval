There is no force in the contention that cl of art In view of the admitted failure by the tenants to pay the rent as provided by the rent deed or at the first hearing of the court under the proviso to the lower courts had acted arbitrarily in refusing to make an order for ejectment against the tenants who had not done what was incumbent on them to do under the law and thereby refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law and it was a case which called for interference by <ORG> and it acted quite properly in doing so The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by special leave against the order made on the th November by the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh in proceedings instituted by the respondents under articles and of the Constitution of India There is no substantial dispute as to the facts leading up to the present appeal The appellants fell into arrears with the payments of rents due for the years and and the respondents made applications to the Rent Controller for eviction of the appellants under section i of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act as extended to Himachal Pradesh On the th December the respondents served on the appellants a notice alling upon the latter to pay whole of the said rent forthwith but the appellants failed to do so The respondents thereupon on the nd January filed an application under section i for the eviction of the appellants on the ground of nonpayment of rent Thereafter on the th January the appellants made an application to the Rent Controller for the fixation of a fair rent under section of the said Act On the th January the appellants filed their written statements in the proceedings under section i admitting the nonpayment of rent and the receipt of the notice but pleaded i that the respondents application was barred by reason of the rejection of the previous applications for eviction made by the respondents and ii that the present application could not be entertained in view of the pendency of their application for fixation of a fair rent under section of the said Act Have the opposite party already filed an application in the said court for the fixation of rent and are they therefore not liable for ejectment pending the decision on the application and what is its effect on the said application Onus on defendants By his judgment dated the th May the Rent Controller held that as the previous applications related to non payment of rents for the years and the present application which was founded on non payment of rent for was not barred under section of the said Act but although the fact of rent being in arrears was admitted the Rent Controller did not think fit to make an order directing the appellants to put the respondents in possession of the demised premises The reasons given by him were as follows Regarding the non payment of the rent when the plea of the tenant is only that he is waiting for the fixation of fair rent by the Rent Controller there is not enough ground for ejectment The parties should bear their own The respondents preferred an appeal to the District Judge of Mahasu under section of the said Act Undoubtedly that is the correct legal position but in the present case the non payment of rent was due to a misapprehension of the legal position created by the tenant filing an application for fixing fair rent He accordingly set aside the orders of the courts below and allowed the application for ejectment but gave the appelants three months time for vacating the premises The appellants have now come up before this court on appeal by special leave obtained from this court Learned advocate appearing in support of this appeal urges that the learned Judicial Commissioner acted wholly without jurisdiction inasmuch as the Rent Controller or the District Judge exercising powers under the Act was not amenable to the jurisdiction of <ORG> and therefore article confers no power on the court of the Judicial Commissioner over the Rent Controller or the District Judge and that article read with article confers no power of judicial superintendence on the court of the Judicial Commissioner The court of the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh exercises jurisdiction in relation to the whole of the territories of Himachal Pradesh Therefore article read with article confers on the court of the Judicial Commissioner power of superintendence over such tribunals The only question raised is as to the nature of the power of superintendence conferred by the article Reference is made to clause of the article in support of the contention that this article only confers on the <ORG> administrative superintendence over the subordinate courts and tribunals Further the preponderance of judicial opinion in India was that section which was similar in terms to section of the <ORG>s Act gave a power of judicial superintendence to the <ORG> apart from and independently of the provisions of other laws conferring revisional jurisdiction on the <ORG> Our attention has not been drawn to any case which has taken a different view and as at present advised we see no reason to take a different view The lower courts realised the legal position but in effect declined to do what was by section i incumbent on them to do and thereby refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law In our opinion there is no ground on which in an appeal by special leave under article we should interfere The appeal therefore must stand dismissed with costs
