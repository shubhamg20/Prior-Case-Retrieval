{"query": "to notify the date on which a particular provision may come into effect parties cannot take advantage of this handicap and audaciously challenge every date of coming into force of every provision as capriciously picked out < name > the judgment of the court was delivered by krishna iyer this judgment deals with a flood of cases from uttar pradesh relating to limitation on agricultural land holdings and specifically disposes of the writ petitions civil appeals and petitions for special leave listed below a as the very first amendment in the very first year after the constitution came into force the forensic landscape is cluttered up in this court with appeals and writ petitions and petitions for leave to appeal the common feature of each of which is a challenge to the validity of one or other of the < org > laws imposing ceiling on land holding in an inegalitarian milieu of the landed few and the landless many on the legislative projects for acquisition and distribution on their constitutional merits and we proceed to as say the task with special reference to the uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling on land holdings act abbreviated hereafter as the act thus we get the statutory perspective of agrarian reform and so the constitutionality of the act has to be tested on the touchstone of art a which is the relevant protective armour for land reform laws even here we must state that while we do refer to the range of constitutional immunity art a confers on agrarian reform measures we do not rest our decision on that provision a the impugned legislation can withstand constitutional invasion and so the further challenge to art the comprehensive vocabulary of that purposeful provision obviously catches within its protective net the present act and broadly speaking the antiseptic effect of that article is sufficient to immunise the act against invalidation to the extent stated therein a < name > case decided by a bench of judges while holding that the constitution first amendment act exceeded the constituent power still categorically declared that the said amendment and a few other like amendments would be held good based on the doctrine of prospective over ruling the result for our purpose is that even < name > case has held art the note struck by later cases reversing < name > does not militate against the vires of art that decision binds on the simple score of stare decisis and the constitutional ground of art in this view other submissions sparkling with creative ingenuity and presented with high pressure advocacy

in society resulting in a landless class on the one hand and a concentration of land in the hands of a few on the other but envisages also the raising of economic standards and bettering rural health and social conditions there must be a proper planning of rural economy and conditions and a body like the village panchayat is best designed to promote rural welfare than individual owners of small portions of lands further the village panchayat is an authority for purposes of part iii as was conceded before us and it has the protection of art it is a trite saying that india lives in villages and a scheme to make villages self sufficient cannot but be regarded as part of the larger reforms which consolidation of holdings fixing of ceiling on lands distribution of surplus lands and utilising of vacant and waste lands contemplate the professed goal of the legislation is to maximise surplus lands for working out distributive justice and rural development with special reference to giving full opportunity to the agrarian masses to become a major rural resource of the nation thus we have the definitional provision in chapter followed by imposition of ceilings with ancillary provisions for exemption a miscellaneous chapter deals with a variety of factors including offences and penalties mode of hearing and appellate powers and kindred matters since the legislature has plenary power to tile extent conferred by the constitution the attack has to be based and deed has been on constitutional infirmities which if sound must shoot down the act we will now proceed to

{"query": "the record straight injustice is conditioned by the governing social philosophy the prevailing economic approach and paramountly by the constitutional parameters which bind the court and the community we will examine the contentions form this perspective without reference to arts < name > who led the arguments mounted a three point attack < name > is no universal nostrum or cure all when all other arguments fail the last point which had a quaint moral flavour was that transfers of landed property although executed after the dates specified in the act were unreasonably invalidated by the act even when there was no mens rea vis a vis the ceiling law on the part of the transferor and this was violative of art it is perfectly open to the legislature as ancillary to its main policy to prevent activities which defeat the statutory purpose to provide for invalidation of such actions when the alienations are invalidated because they are made after a statutory date fixed with a purpose there is sense in this prohibition provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a a transfer in favour of any person including government referred to in sub section a transfer proved to the satisfaction of the prescribed authority to be in good faith and for adequate consideration and under an irrevocable instrument riot being a benami transaction or for immediate or deferred benefit of the tenure holder or other members of the family there is no blanket ban here but only qualified invalidation of certain sinister assignments etc we reject it without mere discussion counsel further argument is to quote his own words that the impugned provisions do not establish a reasonable procedure because the expression in good faith is over inclusive and takes within its sweep situations which are not only very different but which may not have any nexus or legitimate relationship with the objects and purposes of the ceiling law there is no question of morality or constitutionality even if the clause may be a little over drawn but every great cause claims human martyrs poor consolation for the victim but yet a necessary step if the large owners are not to play the vanishing trick or resort to manipulated alienations after all this ban comes into force only on a well recognised date not from an arbitrary retroactive past to reasonable

{"query": "[CLS] the plaintiff appealed and the lower < org > was invited by both the parties to try the propriety and legality of the service of notice before going into the question of the status of the defendants the plaintiff has appealed to this court and the only ground taken before us is that in the circumstances of this case it should have been held that the notices were legally served the second ground is that defendant no being the registered tenant service on him alone was sufficient and the third is that the defendants being all tenants in common service of notice on one of them should be taken as service on all the first two grounds have been finally disposed of by the learned subordinate judge by coming to certain findings of fact which cannot be challenged in second appeal the learned judge has found that defendant no was not the karta of the family and that he was not the sole registered tenant in the plaintiff sherista the learned subordinate judge observes that it was virtually admitted and was proved that no notice to quit was ever served on defendant no who was all along ignored though his brothers were treated as tenants and that he was subsequently added as a defendant in the suit the facts of that case are that the plaintiff gomosta had sent to each of the defendants by registered letters addressed to them at their addresses duplicates of the notices signed by all the plaintiffs for this he received receipts of registration the < name > however held upon the evidence that there was no proof of service of notice to quit on any of the defendants other than defendants nos and their lordships of < org > examined the evidence on the point on the record and in their lordships view the evidence of delivery of notice to quit on all the principal defendants was adequately proved and constituted good service on them within the meaning of section transfer of property act the personal tender or delivery may take place anywhere the vicarious tender or delivery must take place at the residence of the person intended to be bound by the notice the procedure in the case of joint tenants is that each is intended to be bound and it has long ago been decided that service of a notice to quit upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants section transfer of property act requires that every notice under that section must be in writing and tendered or delivered over personally to the party who is intended to be bound by it or to one of the family or servants at the residence or if such tender or

that the plaintiff did not come from the place where his mother was living and pay certain compliments to the defendant on the occasion of certain hindu festivals is singularly unimpressive and

according to the same dictionary coating iron with zinc by tumbling the article in powdered zinc at about but subsequent to the galvanisation they have acquired a quantity of zinc which has become part and parcel thereof at page it was stated after reference to the encyclopaedia britannica fourteenth edition volume at page that the process of corrugation of iron sheets enabled much lighter gauges of sheets to be used because it makes them very rigid and portable in the andhra pradesh decision it was held that galvanised plain or corrugated sheets and sheets fell within the ambit of iron and steel in entry of the third schedule and that the words that is to say were intended to adopt the most general concept of iron and steel and that the legislature wanted all forms of iron and steel to be brought within that entry the learned judges observed that galvanisation was nothing but coating the iron sheet with zinc by an electrical process or some other processes to prevent it from oxidation and galvanisation improved the utility of the raw material of iron they were under the impression that the expression that is to say was designed to adopt the most general concept of iron and steel so as to take all forms of iron and steel to be brought within the entry it is only in this process of construction of the relevant entry in a wide sense that they came to the conclusion that notwithstanding the corrugation and galvanisation the sheets retained their character as iron and steel goods as we have pointed out these sheets were previously known only as zinc sheets and merely because a different expression has come to be used it does not mean that they retain the character of iron and steel plates [SEP]", "qid": 0, "term_recall": {"andhra": 0.07453559924999298,

{"query": "[CLS] the following two question have been referred to us under section of the income tax act for the assessment year whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the < org >

that seems to have arisen was whether the experimental portion of manufacture was to be considered as a period during which manufacture had taken place for the purpose of applying section for this

full payment should have been made in the previous year towards purchase of the machinery the claim was made before completion of the assessment and therefore the assessee was entitled to benefit of deduction we have considered the rival contentions under ab an assessee is entitled to a deduction of an amount upto of the profits of business or profession if the said amount is either deposited

the purchase of a new ship new aircraft or new machinery or plant it provides for deduction of any amount which has been utilised during the previous year for the purchase of new plant or machinery etc the assessee utilised an amount of rs we therefore do not agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the assessee that the entire claim of rs in this view of the matter we do not find

who are not parties to a contract can be admitted to sue thereon except where there is an obligation in equity amounting to a trust arising out of the contract i say nothing as to whether special rules of law may be applicable to communities among whom marriages are contracted for minors by parents and guardians but putting aside such cases i see no reason to think that the law in india contains a series of exceptions to the principle that a contract can only be sued upon as such by a party thereto a trust may be founded on a contract and is capable of being enforced by a party to the trust in appropriate proceedings as was pointed out in < name > < name > hare it is another matter altogether to say that a person not a party to a contract may bring a suit upon the contract by reason of near relationship to the promisee nearness of relationship is a fact which like many other facts cannot be disregarded in determining the question whether or not a trust arises out of or is founded on a contract but it has no other importance in < name > case the < org > considered whether the policy amounted to a trust for the widow and having found that it did not determined the matter by the ordinary law of contract this in my judgment is the only method which can be justified in principle is in my judgment a clear mistake and the mistake is not cured by the circumstance that under the contract act the definition of consideration is wider than in", "qid": 3, "term_recall": {"appli": 0.3162277660168379, "english": 0.15811388300841897, "enabl": 0.10540925533894598, "behalf":

{"query": "firm and that the provisions of chapter so far as may be apply to such assessment the liability declared by is undoubtedly to assessment under chapter iv but the expression assessment used therein does not merely mean computation of income the expression assessment as has often been said is used in the income tax act with different connotations in commissioner of income tax < org > < name > < org > observed one of the peculiarities of most income tax act is that the word assessment is used as meaning sometimes the computation of income sometimes the determination of the amount of tax payable and sometimes the whole procedure laid down in the act for imposing liability upon the tax payer the indian income tax act is no exception in this respect a review of the provisions of chapter iv of the act sufficiently discloses that the word assessment has been used in its widest connotation in that chapter the section which deals with assessment merely as computation of income is but several sections deal not with computation of income but determination of liability machinery for imposing liability and the procedure in that behalf section a deals with advance payment of tax and imposition of penalties for failure to carry out the provisions there in section a deals with power to assess individual members of certain companies on the income deemed to have been distributed as dividend deals with assessment in case of departure from taxable territories deals with collection of tax out of the estate of deceased persons deals with assessment in case of discontinued business a with assessment after partition of hindu undivided families and ss and deal with the issue of demand notices and the filing of appeals and for reviewing assessment and deals with assessment of incomes which have escaped assessment the expression assessment used in these sections is not used merely in the sense of computation of income and there is in our judgment no ground for holding i that when by it is declared that the partners or members of the association shall be jointly and severally liable to assessment it is only intended to declare the liability to computation of income under and not to the application of the procedure for declaration and imposition of tax liability and the machinery for enforcement thereof nor has the expression all the provisions of chapter iv shall so far as may be apply to such assessment a restricted content in terms it says that all the provisions of chapter iv shall apply so far as may be to assessment of firms which have discontinued their business by the liability to pay additional tax which is designated penalty is imposed in view of the dishonest contumacious conduct of the assessee it is true that this liability arises only if
