0	[CLS] the relevant facts appearing from the statement of the case in it ref no of are that the assessee had entered into an agreement with < name > basle st jan the assessee entered in another supplementary agreement on th july for manufacturing cyanuric chloride under this agreement the assessee had to pay certain amounts in five equal instalments to < name > for acquiring technical know how the first payment in respect of which was made in financial year the assessee claimed deduction thereof as business expenditure of manufacturing cyanuric chloride commencing from financial year as a revenue expenditure the < org > rejected the contention of the assessee by taking the view that because the payments were made for getting sub licence to manufacture cyanuric chloride for a period not less than years it could not be claimed as a revenue expenditure the cit a held that the payment in question represented normal revenue expenditure which should have been allowed as a deduction by the < org > however the amount claimed in each case is different we have heard the learned counsel for the parties likewise < org > has also obtained licence from a german company < org > to manufacture in india cyanuric chloride under or according to < org > patents processes know how and improvements the plant for manufacturing cyanuric chloride would not be discontinued even after the expiry of the period but continue to manufacture the same under the process already made known to the assessee inasmuch as there was no stipulation under the agreement either principal or supplementary that on termination of the agreement the assessee would discontinue the manufacture of cyanuric chloride on the other hand it was contended by the learned counsel for the assessee < name > that the technical know how acquired under the said agreement was operational cost for the running the business and the amount paid to the collaborator of technical know how was only paid for the use of the process developed by < org > or < org > for manufacturing cyanuric chloride in india and acquisition of right to use is distinct from acquisition to the right itself mere right to use technical know how without having proprietary right therein cannot be considered capital in the hands of the assessee we have given careful consideration to the rival contentions under of the it act all expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business or profession are to be allowed as deduction while computing the income provided the same are not in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee apart from the condition that the same may not be governed by any other express provision of
1	the act in the present case the only question that arises for consideration is other condition being satisfied that the expenses are wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business and are not governed by any other express provision whether the expenses claimed are of capital nature in some cases it has been held that expenditure which brings into existence asset or advantage of enduring benefit is to be considered as capital expenditure a disbursement when it is referable to fixed capital or capital asset is treated as capital expenditure but when it relates to circulating capital or stock in trade it is treated as revenue it has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction and some in the other one consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vague indications in the contrary directions it is a common sense appreciation of all the guiding factors which must provide the ultimate answer test which was laid by viscount < name > in the case of < org > tax cases when an expenditure is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of trade i think that there is good reason in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such expenditure attributable not to revenue but to capital lord < name > in < org > vs < name > tax cases opined that the capital expenditure is a thing which is going to be spent once and for all income expenditure is a thing which is going to be recur every year what is meant by expression once and for all the expression once and for all is used to denote an expenditure which is made once and for all for procuring an enduring benefit to the business as distinct from recurring expenditure in the nature of operational expenses if on the other hand it is made not for the purpose of bringing into existence any such asset or advantage for but for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profit it is a revenue expenditure the aim and object of expenditure would determine the character of expenditure whether it is a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure another test evolved was to find out as to whether the expenses incurred are part of the working expenses or the expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning in other words it is capital outlay if such expenditure is necessary for the acquisition of property or of rights of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on its trade at all is it part of the company working expenses is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit making or on the other hand is
2	it a capital outlay is it expenditure necessary for the acquisition of property or of rights of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on its trade at all of taxation clr is that what is an outgoing of capital and what is an outgoing on account of revenue depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights if any secured employed or exhausted in the process < org > said that when dealing with cases of this kind where the question is whether expenditure incurred by an assessee is capital or revenue expenditure the question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency if the outgoing expenditure is so related to the carrying on or the conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an integral part of profit earning process and not the acquisition of asset or right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure if the advantage consists merely in facilitating the assessee trading operations or enabling the management and conduct of the assessee business to be carried on more efficiently or more profitably by leaving the fixed capital untouched the expenditure would be on revenue account even though the advantage may endure for an indefinite future another test which has been applied while considering the nature of expenses is that if it is made for initiation of business or extension of business or substantial replacement of equipment the pharmaceutical section of < org > in india was taken over by the assessee in under an agreement the < org > undertook to deliver to the assessee all processes formulae scientific data working rules and prescriptions pertaining to the manufacture or processing products discovered and developed in the < org > laboratories and to forward to the assessee as far as possible all scientific and bibliographic information pamphlets or drafts which might be useful to introduce the licensed preparation and to promote their sale in india it granted to the assessee full and sole rights and licence under patent listed in the agreement to make use of the same and also a licence to use certain specified trade marks in the territory subject to any existing licence to third parties held at the date of the agreement or the < org > may grant to third party thereafter in consideration of that right to receive scientific and technical assistance payments were to be made to the < org > repelling the < org > contention that the contribution made to the < org > was not entitled to deduction under xv because expenses were capital in nature
3	the court said the assessee did not under the agreement become entitled exclusively even for the period of the agreement to the patents and trade marks of < org > it had merely access to the technical knowledge and experience in the pharmaceutical field which < org > commanded the assessee was on that account mere licensee for a limited period of the technical knowledge of < org > with the right to use the patents and trade marks of that company the assessee acquired under the agreement merely the right to draw for the purpose of carrying on its business as a manufacturer and dealer of pharmaceutical products upon the technical knowledge of < org > for a limited period by making that technical knowledge available < org > did not part with any asset of its business nor did the assessee acquire any asset or advantage of an enduring nature for the benefit of its business the court said applying tests that aim and object for incurring expenses is one of the guiding factors and as the expenses in the case was for the acquisition of the know how as it was a condition on which the collaboration agreed to part with the technical knowledge to the assessee it was treated to be the revenue expenditure on commercial principle it was granted licence for manufacture of penicillin with a view to increasing the yield the appellant negotiated with < org > a reputed japanese enterprise whereunder in consideration for once for all payment of us it agreed to supply the assessee pilot plant technical information know how and written description of < org > process for fermentation of penicillin with a flow sheet of the process on pilot plant and to arrange for the training of appellant representatives in various plants in japan at assessee expenditure and advise the assessee in large scale manufacture for a period of years assessee claim for deduction of the sum paid to the japanese company as revenue expenditure was disallowed by the < org > holding that the expenses were capital in nature for the purpose of setting up of new plant and new process and that the for complete replacement of the business inasmuch as the new process and new establishment of plant was to be put up in place of old process and old plant reversing the decision of < org > hon ble supreme court observed that there was no material before the < org > to come to the finding that the appellant had obtained under the agreement a completely new plant with a completely new process and completely new technical know how there was no material before the < org > that the area of improvisation was not part of the existing business
4	there was no material to hold that it amounted to a new or fresh venture what was stipulated was improvement of operation of existing business and its efficiency and profitability not removed from the area of day to day business of the appellants established enterprise the financial outlay under the agreement for the better conduct and improvement of the existing business and as revenue in nature and was allowable deduction in computing the business profit of the appellant the most important aspects relevant for the present purpose which can be culled out from above discussion is that where expenses are incurred in areas which supplement the existing business and is not a fresh or new venture and agreement of acquiring technical know how pertain to product already in the line of the established business which was intended to improve the operations of the existing business its efficiency and profitability from the area of day to day business of the appellant established enterprise expenses be treated as revenue and not capital on the other hand if the technical know how is acquired for the purpose of establishing altogether a new or fresh venture launching of a new enterprise the same expenditure may be treated as capital and not revenue under the principal agreement clause the assessee was though free to purchase raw materials and intermediaries from any source but the purchase of products manufactured by < org > or from those who produce and manufacture raw material and intermediaries under the < org > patent there was a prohibition to purchase such raw material from any source manufacturing the intermediary products in violation of < org > patent cyanuric chloride was one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of tinopal which was consumed in large quantities if therefore applying the test laid down in < org > case supra which in our opinion does apply to the facts of the present case the assessee existing business was the business of manufacturing tinopal the product which the assessee intended to manufacture namely cyanuric chloride was one of the raw materials which until it started manufacturing was being purchased in large quantities from the market the purpose of production of cyanuric chloride was found by the < org > to be the manufacture of raw material or production of tinopal that is to say the purpose was in the area of existing business of the assessee for carrying on the existing business with more profitability and was not for the purposes of entering into a new adventure for operating in a new area of business if that be so the expenses incurred for acquiring the technical know how to manufacture raw material necessary for the principal product of the assessee to cut down the cost of producing raw materials from the market was the
5	operational cost of the existing business incurred for the purpose of cutting down the day to day cost of the business and not for the purpose of installing a new business the expenses had to be held to be revenue in nature and not capital though we observe that the < org > was not correct in observing that there would be no useful knowledge left which would help the assessee in manufacturing cyanuric chloride after the agreement is concluded as a result of operation of clause which required the assessee to return < org > all documents put at the assessee disposal and relating to manufacturing of engineering plants designs etc however as we observe in the present case particularly in the matter of acquisition of the technical know how it is of great importance that for what purpose technical know how was acquired now it is obvious that by purchase of such quota right the assessee would be able to acquire more raw material and that would increase the profitability of his profit making apparatus but the amount paid for purchase of such quota right would indubitably be revenue expenditure since it is incurred for acquiring raw material and is part of the operating cost the principle fully applies to the facts found by the < org > in the present case according to which the assessee had entered into an agreement on th july for manufacturing raw material for the purpose of production of tinopal even applying the test of acquisition of assets it can be said that under the agreement the assessee did not acquire the capital asset itself namely the technical know how as a proprietor thereof what it acquired under the agreement on th july was only the right to use technical knowledge available with < org > or < org > it had right only to use that knowledge for the purpose of manufacturing cyanuric chloride within india but it cannot be said that by such acquisition of knowledge the assessee has acquired any capital asset so far as question as to whether it amounts to acquisition of advantage benefit of enduring nature is concerned as we have already discussed it depends upon the object with which such advantage or benefit has been acquired if the advantage or benefit had been acquired to facilitate running of the existing business it should be treated as the expenditure on revenue account if the advantage or benefit acquired for establishing a fresh venture it may be treated as part of expenditure on capital account as in the present case the finding of the < org > reveals that the advantage was acquired for the purpose of manufacturing raw material for production of tinopal which was the existing business of the assessee we have no hesitation
6	in coming to conclusion that the expenditure incurred was rightfully held to be on revenue account accordingly we answer the question referred to us in affirmative in all the four cases in favour of the assessee and against the < org > [SEP]

8	capacity and as the suit was admittedly brought more than a year after the date of that act it must be held to be barred in that case it was held that if a collector disposed of land the property of a private individual purporting to act under section of the bombay land revenue code the disposition is a nullity because section does not give power to deal with the lands of private individuals it would appear to follow that the act of dispossession is equally a nullity not in the sense that it is a negligible quantity but in the sense that it is not an act done by an officer in his official capacity it therefore stands on no other footing than an act of dispossession by a private individual the district deputy collector held erroneously that the plaintiff was not entitled to the possession of certain land and the suit was filed more than a year after the order it was held that the order gave the plaintiff a cause of action but that as it was based on an erroneous view of the facts it was ultra vires the district deputy collector did not therefore act in his official capacity and article had no application it seems to me impossible to escape the conclusion that here too by parity of reasoning the act was not done by the district deputy collector in his official capacity where an officer of government purports to act under a statutory authority but in fact acts in excess of that authority his act should be treated as a nullity this appears to be the view hitherto taken by this court and no valid ground is shown for questioning it it would appear to follow that article has no application here i would therefore reverse the decree of the lower court and make a decree for possession and mesne profits under order xx rule of the civil procedure code i desire to add a word with reference to the point of limitation raised on behalf of defendant no for the first time in the appeal before us having regard to the nature of the point as also to the circumstance that it involves no investigation into any fresh facts we have considered the point of limitation it seems to me that the real question in the case is whether any breach of the conditions of the grant is established for if that is not established under the circumstances of this case the defendant no must fail on the merits as well as on the point of limitation both on the question of fact as to the alleged breach of the conditions of the grant and on the question of law as to the effect of that finding on the point of limitation i entirely agree with my learned brother [SEP]

13	collected unless the commodity leaves the factory counsel submits that rules and as they stood before they were amended and even the main part of these two rules after amendment indicate in clear terms that so long as the goods which are manufactured in the factory are not removed there is no question of payment of excise duty on the goods several decisions have been cited on behalf of the appellants to show that < org > also have taken the view that removal is the main criterion for the collection of excise duty on the commodity produced or manufactured inside the factory or the place of manufacture we shall presently refer to these decisions it may however be noticed that the decisions are not also uniform on the interpretation of rules and as they stood before amendment we are however really concerned with the interpretation of these two rules after amendment but as much submissions have been made by the parties in the light of the decisions of < org > on the interpretation of these two rules we would like to refer to the same according to this decision if the product which is obtained at an intermediate stage of an integrated and uninterrupted process of manufacture there is no removal of such product the question that came up for consideration of < org > was whether there was removal of calcium carbide for the purpose of levy and collection of excise duty it was accordingly held that it could not therefore be said that calcium carbide made by the petitioner company was removed from the factory in which it was produced this decision lays down that so long as a commodity is not removed from the factory premises there is no removal within the meaning of rules and in that case the petitioner manufactured bentol a mixture of benzene and toluene in the factory which was again used for the manufacture or rubber < org > took the view that it was not a case of removal under rules and and as such no excise duty was payable on bentol thus it appears that there is a conflict of opinion in the decisions of < org > as to what is meant by the word removal for the purpose of payment of excise duty one view is that so long as any product manufactured in the factory is not actually removed from the factory premises there is no removal and accordingly no excise duty is payable on the product even if the product is used for the manufacture of another commodity inside the factory the other view is that if at one stage a commodity known to the market is produced and is transferred within the factory for the manufacture of another commodity there is removal within the meaning of rules and < name > apart from the above two views
14	there is a third view which has a also been expressed by < org > namely that if an intermediate product is obtained in an integrated process of manufacture of a commodity there is no removal and therefore such intermediate product although known to the market and comes under a particular tariff item yet as there is no removal there will be no question of payment of excise duty on such intermediate product it has been held that if the purpose of removal of excisable goods is consumption in the same place where the excisable goods are manufactured or cured or if such excisable goods are used in the manufacture of any other goods in the same place this cannot be done without payment of excise duty at the place and in the manner prescribed it has been observed that an intermediate product which by itself is goods known to the market and is used in captive consumption for bringing out altogether a new goods not by an integrated process but by a distinct and separate process is liable to excise duty before its removal it is manifestly clear from rule that it contemplates not only removal from the place where the excisable goods are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto but also removal within such place or premises for captive consumption or home consumption as it is called the decisions which have taken the view that if a commodity manufactured within the factory in one plant is transferred to another plant for the purpose of production of another commodity will be removal for the purpose of payment of excise duty are in our opinion correct there can be no doubt that if a commodity is taken outside the factory it will be removal but rule does not in any manner indicate that it is only when the goods are removed from the factory premises it will be removal and when the excisable goods manufactured within the factory is removed from one plant to another it will not be a case of removal on the contrary as noticed already rule clearly embraces within it captive consumtion of excisable goods that is to say when excisable goods manufactured in the factory are used for production of another commodity now the question is whether rule before it was amended also envisaged a case of an intermediate product obtained in an integrated and continuous process of manufacture of another commodity that is the end product it must be admitted that prima facie rule does not show that it also covers a case of integrated continuous and uninterrupted process of manufacture producing a commodity at an intermediate stage which again is utilised in such continuous process for the manufacture of the end product the learned attorney general appearing on behalf of < or
15	##g > submits that rule and rule also envisaged such a case of integrated process of manufacture of the end product using a product produced at an intermediate stage in support of his contention he has placed reliance on an unreported decision of < org > in misc the learned single judge of < org > took the view that a continuous or integrated process of manufacture was not initially contemplated by rule or rule but after the addition of a new set of rules being rules a to to the rules by the notification dated may a continuous and integrated process of manufacture came to be contemplated by the scheme of the act and the rules reliance has been placed by the learned judge on the explanation to rule a as added by the said notification dated may reliance has also been placed on rule which provides for the procedure to be followed by an assessee who is a manufacturer of matches or cigarettes or cheroots the relevant portion of rule is a proviso thereto which is as follows provided that the duty due on the goods consumed within the factory in a continuous process may be so paid at the end of the factory day from the above provisions of the explanation to rule a and the proviso to rule the learned judge has taken the view that a continuous or integrated process of manufacture has come to be contemplated by the scheme of the act and the rules framed thereunder for the first time only in may the scheme having been brought into force with effect from june and prior thereto such a continuous or integrated manufacturing process was never contemplated by the act or the rules learned attorney general gets inspiration from the said unreported case of < org > and submits that atleast since after may rule and rule envisage the case of an integrated and continuous process of manufacture involving the use or utilisation of a commodity produced at an intermediate stage of such process for the manufacture of an end product or commodity it is submitted by him that if the interpretation as given by the learned single judge of < org > in the above unreported decision is accepted in that case it will not be necessary to consider the effect of amended rule or rule that is to say the explanations that have been added to these two rules it may be that the concept of continuous or integrated process of manufacture has been recognised in the explanation to sub rule of rule a and in the proviso to rule but we do not think that rule or rule should be interpreted in the light of provisions of the explanation to sub rule of rule a or the proviso to rule moreover we are not concerned with the interpretation of rule and
16	rule as they stood before the amendment in the instant case the appellants have challenged rule and rule as amended by the notification dated february we are therefore concerned with the interpretation of these rules as amended particularly the question of validity of these rules before we proceed to consider the contentions made on behalf of the parties it may be stated that in view of the divergence of judicial opinions as to the interpretation of rules and before they were amended the explanations to rules and have been added so as to obviate any doubt the explanations to rule and rule inter alia provide that commodity obtained at an intermediate stage of manufacture in a continuous process shall be deemed to have been removed from such place or premises as mentioned in sub rule of rule this deeming provision has been given retrospective effect by virtue of section of the finance act it is urged by mr < name > learned counsel for the appellants that the amended rule and rule are arbitrary and unreasonable inasmuch as the goods which in fact are not removed from the factory and which are incapable of removal because of the nature and construction of the plant or the nature and character of the manufacturing process are fictionally treated as having been removed it is submitted that as a result of the amendment of these rules the appellants are exposed to excessive hardship for not complying with the statutory provisions in view of the length of the retrospective operation of the amendments namely years from the date of the commencement of the act that is february the appellants would be called upon to pay enormous amount of duty in respect of the entire quantity of goods which have come into existence and have been captively consumed within the factory premises the appellants will not however be able to pass on this burden to consumers and will have to bear the same themselves it is submitted that in view of the arbitrariness and unreasonableness of the amendments and the hardships that will be caused to the appellants and other manufacturers of excisable goods the amendments should be struck down as violative of the provisions of article and article of the constitution of india the apprehension of the appellants is that the amendments to rules and having been made retrospective from the date the rules were framed that is from february the appellants and others similarly situated may be called upon to pay enormous amounts of duty in respect of intermediate goods which have come into existence and again consumed in the integrated process of manufacture of another commodity there can be no doubt that if one has to pay duty with retrospective effect from it would really cause great hardship but in our opinion in view of section i ia of the act there is no cause for such apprehension when any duty of excise has not been levied or
17	paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded a central excise officer may within six months from the relevant date serve notice on the person chargeable with the duty which has not been levied or paid or which has been short levied or short paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice provided that where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded by reason of fraud collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts or contravention of any of the provisions of this act or of the rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duty by such person or his agent the provisions of this sub section shall have effect as if for the words six months the words five years were substituted where the service of the notice is stayed by an order of a court the period of such stay shall be excluded in computing the aforesaid period of six months or five years as the case may be under section a i the excise authorities cannot recover duties not levied or not paid or short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded beyond the period of six months the proviso to section ia not being applicable in the present case thus although section of the finance act has given retrospective effect to the amendments of rules and yet it must be subject to the provision of section a of the act we are unable to accept the contention of the learned attorney general that as section has made the amendments retrospective in operation since february it should be held that it overrides the provision of section a if the intention of the < org > was to nullify the effect of section a in that case the < org > would have specifically provided for the same section does not contain any non obstante clause nor does it refer to the provision of section ia in the circumstances it is difficult to hold that section overrides the provision of section ia it is however contended by the learned attorney general that as the law was amended for the first time on february the cause of action for the excise authorities to demand excise duty in terms of the amended provision arose on that day that is on february and accordingly the authorities are entitled to make such demand with retrospective effect beyond the period of six months but such demand though it may include within it demand for more than six months must be made within a period of six months from the date of the amendment there is no provision in the act or in the rules enabling the excise authorities to make any demand beyond the periods mentioned
18	in section a of the act on the ground of the accrual of cause of action in our view section i does not in any manner affect the provision of section a of the act in the absence of any specific provision overriding section ia it will be consistent with rules of harmonious construction to hold that section of the finance act in so far as it gives retrospective effect to the amendments made to rules and of the rules is subject to the provision of section a in the circumstances there is no question of the amended provision of rule and rule being arbitrary unreasonable or violative of the provision of article and article of the constitution of india we may now deal with the challenge made to the retrospective operation of amendments of rules and on another ground in order to appreciate the ground of such challenge we may once more refer to section of the finance act the explanation to section provides as follows explanation for the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that no act or omission on the part of any person shall be punishable as an offence which would not have been so punishable if this section had not come into force it is the contention of the appellants that as the appellants had not complied with the requirements of the amended rules and they would be subjected to penalties and their goods would be confiscated under the amended rules and read with rule of the rules with retrospective effect it is accordingly submitted on behalf of the appellants that the amendment of these two rules with retrospective effect is arbitrary and unreasonable and should be struck down as violative of article of the constitution the contention made on behalf of the apellants is founded on the assumption that under the explanation to section the penalties can be imposed and goods can be confiscated with retrospective effect our attention has been drawn on behalf of the appellants to clause of sub section of section of the act which defines place of removal as follows sub section for the purpose of this section a place of removal means i a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods or ii a warehouse or any other place or premises wherein the excisable goods have been permitted to be deposited without payment of duty from where such goods are removed it is submitted on behalf of the appellants that the explanations to rule and rule are ultra vires the provision of clause of sub section of section of the act inasmuch as place of removal as defined therein does not contemplate any deemed removal but a physical and actual removal of the goods from a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture or a warehouse etc under the definition place of removal may be a factory or any other place or
19	premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods etc the explanation to rules and do not contain any definition of place of removal but provide that excisable goods produced or manufactured in any place or premises at an intermediate stage and consumed or utilised for the manufacture of another commodity in a continuous process shall be deemed to have been removed from such place or premises immediately before such consumption or utilization therefore in view of the deeming provisions under explanations to rules and although the goods which are produced or manufactured at an intermediate stage and thereafter consumed or utilised in the integrated process for the manufacture of another commodity is not actually removed shall be construed and regarded as removed it has been already noticed that the taxing event under section of the act is the production or manufacture of goods and not removal the explanations to rules and contemplate the collection of duty levied on the production of a commodity at an intermediate stage of an integrated process of manufacture of another commodity by deeming such production or manufacture of the commodity at an intermediate stage to be removal from such place or premises of manufacture the deeming provisions are quite consistent with section of the act as observed by < org > in < name > case supra there is in theory nothing to prevent the central legislature from imposing a duty of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence no matter what happens to it after wards whether it be sold consumed or destroyed or given away there is therefore nothing unreasonable in the deeming provision and as discussed above it is quite in conformity with the provision of section of the act the contention that the amendments to rules and are ultra vires clause of sub section of section of the act is without substance and is overruled it is next contended on behalf of the appellants that even assuming that there can be fictional removal as provided in the explanation to rules and there cannot be such fictional or deemed removal without the specification of the place where the excisable goods are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto rule inter alia provides that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the collector in this behalf until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid the explanations to rules and refer to the specification that has been made by the collector under sub rule of rule it is submitted on behalf of the appellants that as no specification has been made by the collector of such place or premises appurtenant thereto the provision of deemed removal with regard to the commodity produced at the intermediate stage and
20	consumed or utilised in the continuous process of manufacture of the end product is inapplicable it is contended that so long as such specification is not made by the collector of the place of manufacture or of any premises appurenant thereto the provision of deemed removal as contained in the explanations to rule and cannot be given effect to on the other hand it is contended by the learned attorney general that specification of the place of manufacture and other places for the storage of the goods is made in the licence which is required to be obtained under rule of the rules rule provides for the form clause of rule provides that every licence granted or renewed under rule shall have reference only to the premises if any described in such licence again under rule of the rules the collector may require any manufacturer to make a prior declaration of factory premises and its equipments it is true that under rule there is a provision for specification by the collector but the question is what has to be specified by the collector rule in our opinion does not require the collector to specify the place where the excisable goods are produced cured or manufactured the words which may be specified by the collector in this behalf occurring in rule of the rules do not qualify the words any place where they are produced cured or manufactured but relate to or qualify the words any premises appurtenant thereto in other words if the place of removal is not the place where the goods are produced cured or manufactured but any premises appurtenant to such place in that case the collector has to specify such premises for the purpose of collection of excise duty in view of this direction given in the circular the learned counsel for the appellants submits that it is not only binding on the collector and the other officers of < org > but also the circular is in the nature of contemporanea exposito rendering useful aid in the construction of the provision of rule i of the rules this contention finds support from the decision of this court in var ghese the income tax officer ernakulam i relied on by the learned counsel of the appellants indeed it has been observed in that case that the rule of construction by reference to contemporanea exposito is a well established rule for interpreting a statute by reference to the exposition it has received from contemporary authority though it must give way where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous further it has been observed that in a modern progressive society it would be unreasonable to confine the intention of a < org > to the meaning attributable to the word used at the time the law was made and unless a contrary
21	intention appears an interpretation should be given to the words used to take in new facts and situations if the words are capable of comprehending them most respectfully we agree with the said observation of < name > in the circumstances we do not agree with the direction of < org > given in the impugned circular that both the place of manufacture and the premises appurtenant thereto must be specified by the collector under rule of the rules further section of this finance act giving retrospective effect to the said amendments is also legal and valid in the instant case the appellants are liable to pay excise duty on the yarn which is obtained at an intermediate stage and thereafter further processed in an integrated process for weaving the same into fabrics although it has been alleged that the yarn is obtained at an intermediate stage of an integrated process of manufacture of fabrics it appears to be not so after the yarn is produced it is sized and thereafter subjected to a process of weaving the same into fabrics be that as it may as we have held that the commodity which is obtained at an intermediate stage of an integrated process of manufacture of another commodity is liable to the payment of excise duty the yarn that is produced by the appellants is also liable to payment of excise duty in our view < org > by the impugned judgment has rightly held that the appellants are not liable to pay any excise duty on the yarn after it is sized for the purpose of weaving the same into fabrics no distinction can be made between unsized yarn and sized yarn for the unsized yarn when converted into sized yarn does not lose its character as yarn for the reason aforesaid the judgment of < org > is affirmed and this appeal is dismissed [SEP]
22	[CLS] on july he was appointed to officiate in class ii service as asst on certain adverse remarks made against him in his confidential report for the year ending march the general manager on june thereupon the appellant made a representation but on i the single judge who heard the matter held that the order was invalid as the provisions of art the question for decision was whether the order of the general manager amounted to a reduction in rank within the meaning of art of the constitution and the appellant was entitled to a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the order held per < name > < name > < name > < name > < name > < name > dissenting that the order of reversion made against the petitioner did not amount to a reduction in rank within the meaning of art of the constitution and he was not entitled to the protection of that article of the constitution which makes no distinction between persons holding permanent or temporary posts in the matter of their tenure being dependent on the pleasure of the president or the governor art also makes no distinction between permanent and temporary posts and extends its protection equally to all < org > servants holding permanent or temporary posts or officiating in any of them i can be available only where dismissal removal or reduction in rank is sought to be inflicted by way of punishment and not otherwise one test for determining whether the termination of service was by way of punishment or otherwise is to ascertain whether under the service rules but for such termination the servant has the right to hold the post in the three cases of substantive appointment to a permanent post temporary appointment for a fixed term and a temporary appointment which has ripened into a quasi permanent status under the temporary service rules where such a right exists the servant will be entitled to the protection of art conversely where no such right can exist as in the case of a probationary or officiating appointment to a permanent or temporary post or where the service has not ripened into a quasi permanent status and under the general law the service can be terminated on reasonable notice the termination of service cannot amount to a punishment and attract the article can apply to those cases where the < org > servant if in private employment could maintain an action for wrongful dismissal removal or reduction in rank so where the < org > has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to terminate the service at any time such termination in the manner provided in the contract or under the rules cannot attract the provisions of art that does not however mean that the termination of service of a servant who has no right to the post can never be a dismissal or removal by way of
23	punishment a reduction in rank must similarly be a punishment if it carries penal consequences with it and the two tests to be applied are whether the servant has a right to the post or the rank or whether evil consequences such as forfeiture of pay or allowances loss of seniority in his substantive rank stoppage or postponement of future chances of promotion follow as a result of the order in the instant case the appellant was holding an officiating post and had no right under the rules of the railway code to continue in it the order of the general manager visited him with no evil consequences consequently he was not reduced in rank by way of punishment applies to all classes of < org > servants whether permanent quasipermanent officiating temporary or on probation and that the words dismissal removal and reduction in rank used therein have a special meaning that article properly construed cannot be confined to the penalties prescribed by the service rules the real test is whether evil consequences over and above those that would ensue from a contractual termination are likely to ensue is attracted even though such evil consequences are not prescribed as penalties under the rules though the conditions of service prescribed by the rules can be varied unilaterally in some cases because of the pleasure of the president they cannot be ignored as long as they stand and if they are infringed while in force art nor can the protections afforded by art in the present case the general manager remarks in the confidential file which formed a part of the operative order and was its real foundation clearly indicated the mischief that the appellant was not to be promoted to a like post until in the opinion of some competent officer he had made good his previous short comings appeal from the judgment and order dated january of < org > circuit bench at delhi in letters patent appeal no of arising out of the judgment and order dated april of the single judge of the circuit bench of < org > in civil writ no of das this appeal has been filed with a certificate of fitness granted by the punjab high court on august it is directed against the judgment and order passed by a division bench of that court on january in letters patent appeal no of reversing the judgment and order of mr justice < name > pronounced on april whereby his lordship had allowed the appellant application being civil writ no of and set aside the order passed by the general manager < org > on august reverting the petitioner from the post of signal and tele communication engineer < org > in class ii service where the appellant was officiating to his substantive post in class iii service this appeal raises a very
24	important question about the construction of art i am disappointed to read these reports on july the appellant who had by this time earned two increments on july and july made a representation against the remarks made against him he should also be informed that he has in his representation used language unbecoming of a senior official and that he should desist from this in future < name > in the meantime the petitioner had on february filed his writ petition under art mr justice < name > took the view that the petitioner had been punished by being reduced in rank without being given an opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him and that consequently the order was invalid for non compliance with the provisions of art < org > having subsequently certified that it was a fit case for appeal to this court the petitioner has now come up on appeal before us and the question for our decision is whether the order passed by the general manager on august amounted to a reduction in rank within the meaning of art under the english common law all servants of the < org > held office during the pleasure of the < org > and were liable to be dismissed at any time and without any reason being assigned for such dismissal no action lay against the < org > in respect of such dismissal even though it were contrary to the express term of the contract of employment for the theory was that the < org > could not fetter its future executive action by entering into a contract in matters which concerned the welfare of the < org > the established notion was that the implied condition between the < org > and its servant was that the latter held his office during the pleasure of the < org > no matter whether it had been referred to when the engagement had been made or not and that public policy demanded this qualification in the < org > of bihar < name > however this court held for reasons stated in the judgment delivered by < name > that the indian law has not adopted the rule of english law on the subject in its entirety ch as originally enacted there was no reference to this doctrine of the english common law subject to the provisions of this act and the rules made thereunder every person in the civil service of the < org > in india holds office during his majesty pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed and the secretary of < org > in council may except so

27	services in chapter i of part xiv which deals with the services under the union and the states in the absence of a contract to the contrary the terms of employment of persons in different services are governed by rules made by the appropriate authorities to which reference will hereafter be made the conditions of service of a < org > servant appointed to a post permanent or temporary are regulated by the terms of the contract of employment express or implied and subject thereto by the rules applicable to the members of the particular service this lien is defined in fundamental rule ch as the title of a < org > servant to hold substantively a permanent post including a tenure post to which he has been appointed substantively the < org > cannot terminate his service unless it is entitled to do so by virtue of a special term of the contract of employment by giving the requisite notice provided by the contract or by the rules governing the conditions of his service on attainment of the age of superannuation prescribed by the rules or on the fulfilment of the conditions for compulsory retirement or subject to certain safeguards on the abolition of the post or on being found guilty after a proper enquiry on notice to him of misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other disqualification an appointment to a permanent post in < org > service on probation means as in the case of a person appointed by a private employer that the servant so appointed is taken on trial such an employment on probation under the ordinary law of master and servant comes to an end if during or at the end of the probation the servant so appointed on trial is found unsuitable and his service is terminated by a notice an appointment to officiate in a permanent post is usually made when the incumbent substantively holding that post is on leave or when the permanent post is vacant and no substantive appointment has yet been made to that post such an officiating appointment comes to an end on the return of the incumbent substantively holding the post from leave in the former case or on a substantive appointment being made to that permanent post in the latter case or on the service of a notice of termination as agreed upon or as may be reasonable under the ordinary law it is therefore quite clear that appointment to a permanent post in a < org > service either on probation or on an officiating basis is from the very nature of such employment itself of a transitory character and in the absence of any special contract or specific rule regulating the conditions of the service the implied term of such appointment under the ordinary law of master and servant is that it is terminable at any time in short in the case of
28	an appointment to a permanent post in a < org > service on probation or on an officiating basis the servant so appointed does not acquire any substantive right to the post and consequently cannot complain any more than a private servant employed on proba tion or on an officiating basis can do if his service is terminated at any time here also in the absence of any special stipulation or any specific service rule the servant so appointed acquires no fight to the post and his service can be terminated at any time except in one case namely when the appointment to a temporary post is for a definite period in such a case the servant so appointed acquires a right to his tenure for that period which cannot be put an end to unless there is a special contract entitling the employer to do so on giving the requisite notice or the person so appointed is on enquiry held on due notice to the servant and after giving him a reasonable opportunity to defend himself found guilty of misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other disqualification and is by way of punishment dismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank the substantive appointment to a temporary post under the rules used to give the servant so appointed certain benefits regarding pay and leave but was otherwise on the same footing as appointment to a temporary post on probation or on an officiating basis that is to say terminable by notice except where under the rules promulgated in to which reference will hereafter be made his service had ripened into what is called a quasi permanent service the position may therefore be summarised as follows in the absence of any special contract the substantive appointment to a permanent post gives the servant so appointed a right to hold the post until under the rules he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired after having put in the prescribed number of years service or the post is abolished and his service cannot be terminated except by way of punishment for misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other disqualification found against him on proper enquiry after due notice to him an appointment to a temporary post for a certain specified period also gives the servant so appointed a right to hold the post for the entire period of his tenure and his tenure cannot be put an end to during that period unless he is by way of punishment dismissed or removed from the service except in these two cases the appointment to a post permanent or temporary on probation or on an officiating basis or a substantive appointment to a temporary post gives to the servant so appointed no right to the post and his srvice may be terminated unless his
29	service had ripened into what is in the service rules called a quasi permanent service a number of decisions bearing on the question of construction of arts and have been cited before us which indicate that there is some difference of opinion between the judges of the different < org > and in some cases amongst the judges of the same < org > thus it has been held in some cases that arts and do not make any distinction between < org > servants who are employed in permanent posts and those who are employed in temporary posts on the other hand it has been held in some cases that a < org > servant cannot be deemed to be a member of a service unless he is permanently absorbed therein nor can he be deemed to be a holder of such post unless he holds it permanently and that such a < org > servant is not entitled to claim the benefit of art but that a termination of service brought about otherwise than by way of punishment by the exercise of the right under the terms of employment or under the relevant rules regulating the conditions of service which form part of the terms of employment does not or is brought about by the exercise of the right to terminate it arising out of the terms of employment agreed upon between the parties or contained in rules regulating the conditions of service subject to which the employment was made article does not in terms say that the protections of that article extend only to persons who are permanent members of the services or who hold permanent civil posts refers to such person as aforesaid and this reference takes us back to cl of that article which speaks of a person who is a member of a civil service of the < org > or an all india service or a civil service of a < org > or holds a civil post under the < org > or a < org > which besides them also includes persons who are members of a defence service or who hold any post connected with defence article also is not in terms confined to persons who are permanent members of the specified services or who hold permanent posts connected with the services therein mentioned to hold that that article covers only those persons who are permanent members of the specified services or who hold posts connected with the services therein mentioned will be to say that persons who are not permanent members of those services or who do not hold permanent posts therein do not hold their respective offices during the pleasure of the president or the governor as the case may be a proposition which obviously cannot stand scrutiny it is obvious that if that article is limited to persons who are permanent members of the services or who hold permanent civil posts the

33	a court martial serious misconduct neglect of duty resulting in or likely to result in loss to government or to a railway administration or danger to the lives of persons using the railway or insolvency or habitual indebtedness and obtaining employment by the concealment of his antecedents which would have prevented his employment in railway service had they been known before his appointment to the authority appointing him suspension is the subject matter of and the procedure for imposing the other penalties is contained in rule provides that no pension is to be granted to an officer dismissed or removed for misconduct insolvency or inefficiency although compassionate allowances may be granted in deserving cases in exercise of the powers conferred by sub of of the act the governor general made certain rules called the central civil service temporary service rules hereinafter referred to as the temporary service rules these rules applied to all persons who held a civil post under < org > and who were under the rulemaking control of the governor general but who did not hold a lien on any post under < org > or any provincial government but they did not apply to several categories of persons including the railway servants by those rules some protection had been given even to persons who did not substantively hold permanent posts further protection was given by the two provisos to that rule by however the employment of persons holding temporary service could be terminated at any time by a month notice in exercise of powers conferred by art in short the service rules out of the several categories of punishments selected the three graver punishments of dismissal removal and reduction in rank and laid down special procedure for giving protection to the < org > servants against the infliction of those three major punishments the position of the government servant was therefore rather insecure for his office being held during the pleasure of his majesty under the act as well as under the act the rules could not over ride or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself the only protection that the government servant had was that by virtue of they could not be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which they were appointed the position however improved to some extent under the act which by gave a further protection in addition to that provided in which reproduced the protection of of the act it follows from the above discussion that both at the date of the commencement of the act and of our constitution the words dismissed removed and reduced in rank as used in the service rules were well understood as signifying or denoting the three major punishments which could be inflicted on government servants the protection given by the rules to the government servant
34	##s against dismissal removal or reduction in rank which could not be en and of to give them a statutory protection by indicating a procedure which had to be followed before the punishments of dismissal removal or reduction in rank could be imposed on them and which could be enforced in law these protections have now been incorporated in art the punishments of dismissal removal and reduction in rank cannot be meted out to the government servant without giving him a reason able opportunity to defend himself the principle embodied in art which give protection to the government servants the net result is that it is only in those cases where the government intends to inflict those three forms of punishments that the government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him it follows therefore that if the termination of service if sought to be brought about otherwise than by way of punishment then the government servant whose service is so terminated cannot claim the protection of art and the decisions cited before us and referred to above in so far as they lay down that principle must be held to be rightly decided the foregoing conclusion however does not solve the entire problem for it has yet to be ascertained as to when an order for the termination of service is inflicted as and by way of punishment and when it is not it has already been said that where a person is appointed substantively to a permanent post in i government service he normally acquires a right to hold the post until under the rules he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired and in the absence of a contract express or implied or a service rule he cannot be turned out of his post unless the post itself is abolished or unless he is guilty of misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualifications and appropriate proceedings are taken under the service rules read with art termination of service of such a servant so appointed must per se be a punishment for it operates as a forfeiture of the servant rights and brings about a premature end of his employment again where a person is appointed to a temporary post for a fixed term of say five years his service cannot in the absence of a contract or a service rule permitting its premature termination be terminated before the expiry of that period unless he has been guilty of some misconduct negligence in further take the case of a person who having been appointed temporarily to a post has been in continuous service for more than three years or has been certified by the appoint ing authority as fit for employment in a quasipermanent capacity such person under of the temporary service rules is to be deemed
35	to be in quasi permanent service which under of those rules can be terminated i in the circumstances and in the manner in which the employment of a < org > servant in a permanent service can be terminated or ii when the appointing authority certifies that a reduction has occurred in the number of posts available for < org > servants not in permanent service thus when the service of a < org > servant holding a post temporarily ripens into a quasi permanent service as defined in the temporary service rules he acquires a right to the post although his appointment was initially temporary and therefore the termination of his employment otherwise than in accordance with of those rules will deprive him of his right to that post which he acquired under the rules and will prima facie be a punishment and regarded as a dismissal or removal from service so as to except in the three cases just mentioned a < org > servant has no right to his post and the termination of service of a < org > servant does not except in those cases amount to a dismissal or removal by way of punishment thus where a person is appointed to a permanent post in a < org > service on probation the termination of his service during or at the end of the period of probation will not ordinarily and by itself be a punishment for the < org > servant so appointed has no right to continue to hold such a post any more than the servant employed on probation by a private employer is entitled to do such a termination does not operate as a forfeiture of any right of the servant to hold the post for he has no such right and obviously cannot be a dismissal removal or reduction in rank by way of punishment this aspect of the matter is recognised in the explanation to of the classification rules which correspond to the note to of the indian railway code and of the rules and of the rules for all those rules expressly say that the termination of such an appointment does not amount to the punishment of dismissal or removal within the meaning of those rules likewise if the servant is appointed to officiate in a permanent post or to hold a temporary post other than one for a fixed term whether substantively or on probation or on an officiating basis under the general law the implied term of his employment is that his service may be terminated on reasonable notice and the termination of the service of such a servant will not per se amount to dismissal or removal from service shortly put the principle is that when a servant has right to a post or to a rank either under the terms of the contract of employment express or implied or under the rules governing the conditions of his service the
36	termination of the service of such a servant or his reduction to a lower post is by itself and prima facie a punishment for it operates as a forfeiture of his right to hold that post or that rank and to get the emoluments and other benefits attached thereto but if the servant has no right to the post as where be is appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an officiating basis and whose temporary service has not ripened into a quasi permanent service as defined in the temporary service rules the termination of his employment does not deprive him of any right and cannot therefore by itself be a punishment one test for determining whether the termination of the service of a < org > servant is by way of punishment is to ascertain whether the servant but for such termination had the right to hold the post if he had a right to the post as in the three cases hereinbefore mentioned the termination of his service will by itself be a punishment and he will be entitled to the protection of art will apply to those cases where the < org > servant had he been employed by a private employer will be entitled to maintain an action for wrongful dismissal removal or reduction in rank to put it in another way if the < org > has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to terminate the employment at any time then such termination in the manner provided by the contract or the rules is prima facie and per se not a punishment and does not attract the provisions of art it does not however follow that except in the three cases mentioned above in all other cases termination of service of a government servant who has no right to his post where he was appointed to a post temporary or permanent either on probation or on an officiating basis and had not acquired a quasi if such a servant was appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an officiating basis then the very transitory character of the employment implies that the employment was terminable at any time on reasonable notice given by the < org > in both cases the < org > may proceed to take action against the servant in exercise of its powers under the terms of the contract of employment express or implied or under the rules regulating the conditions of service if any be applicable and ordinarily in such a situation the < org > will take this course but the < org > may take the view that a simple termination of service is not enough and that the conduct of the servant has been such that he deserves a punishment entailing penal consequences in such a case the < org > may
37	choose to proceed against the servant on the basis of his misconduct negligence inefficiency or the like and inflict on him the punishment of dismissal removal or reduction carrying with it the penal consequences in such a case the servant will be entitled to the protection of art the position may therefore be summed up as follows any and every termination of service is not a dismissal removal or reduction in rank a termination of service brought about by the exercise of a con specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to the infliction of a punishment and does not attract art in either of the two abovementioned cases the termination of the service did not carry with it the penal consequences of loss of pay or allowances under of the fundamental rules in short if the termination of service is founded on the right flowing from contract or the service rules then prima facie the termination is not a punishment and carries with it no evil consequences and so art but even if the < org > has by contract or under the rules the right to terminate the employment without going through the procedure prescribed for inflicting the punishment of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank the < org > may nevertheless choose to punish the servant and if the termination of service is sought to be founded on misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification then it is a punishment and the requirements of art as already stated if the servant has got a right to continue in the post then unless the contract of employment or the rules provide to the contrary his services cannot be terminated otherwise than for misconduct negligence inefficiency or other good and sufficient cause for it operates as a forfeiture of his right and he is visited with the evil consequences of loss of pay and allowances it puts an indelible stigma on the officer i if the < org > servant has a right to a particular rank then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty for he will then lose the emoluments and privileges of that rank if however he has no right to the particular rank his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his sub stantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment but the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the < org > has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a lower post or rank cannot in any circumstances be a punishment the real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order
38	for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the < org > bad purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules in truth and reality the < org > has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty the use of the expression terminate or discharge is not con elusive in spite of the use of such innocuous expressions the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to if the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service or the reversion to his substantive rank must be regarded as a reduction in rank and if the requirements of the rules and art which give protection to < org > servant have not been complied with the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the constitutional right of the servant applying the principles discussed above it is quite clear that the petitioner before us was appointed to the higher post on an officiating basis that is to say he was appointed to officiate in that post which according to indian railway code corresponding to means that he was appointed only to perform the duties of that post he had no right to continue in that post and under the general law the implied term of such appointment was that it was terminable at any time on reasonable notice by the < org > and therefore his reduction did not operate as a forfeiture of any right and could not be described as reduction in rank by way of punishment in these circumstances there is no escape from the conclusion that the petitioner was not reduced in rank by way of punishment and therefore the provisions of art this appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs applies to all classes of < org > servants mentioned in it and that it makes no difference whether they are permanent quasi permanent officiating temporary or on probation i am also clear that except as expressly provided by this constitu tion every person etc holds office during the pleasure of the president these words are absolute and leave no room for inference or deduction there
39	are also others such as arts i also agree with my lord that the words dismissal removal and reduction in rank used in art i would not have said this had it not been for ambiguities that arise otherwise according to the dictionary they mean the same thing or at any rate have subtle shades of distinction that are meaningless in the context in which they are used it was therefore necessary to look to the surrounding circumstances and determine whether they had acquired special technical significance at the date of the constitution except for that i do not think it would have been proper to look at the rules for i cannot agree that the constitution can be construed by reference to acts of the legislature and rules framed by some lesser authority and in particular to rules made and acts passed after the constitution i have used the word right but must hasten to explain that i use it in a special sense the right need not necessarily be justiciable nor need it necessarily amount to a contract but broadly speaking it must be the sort of right which even when not enforceable in the courts would form a good foundation for a petition of right in england but they are convenient expressions to convey a particular thought provided the limitations imposed by the context are not forgotten the word contract is used in art i said in < name > case that the president and < org > are as free to enter into special contracts as any other person provided they are consistent with the constitution that also applies to conditions of service where there are no special contracts these conditions confer a right on one side and correspondingly reduce the ambit of the rights conferred by the contract on the other therefore when < org > exercises one of their rights there is no infringement of the other party rights because to that extent he has none it follows that when in a given case < org > has an option to adopt one of two courses as for example to dismiss or reduce for misconduct and at the same time to terminate or alter the service under a term of the contract or because of a condition of the service then if it chooses to act under the right conferred by the contract art will ensue over and beyond those that would ordinarily follow from a normal termination or alteration when there is no misconduct or blame on the part of the person affected to my mind the test must always be whether evil consequences over and above those that would ensue from a contractual termination are likely to follow now what happened in this case the appellant was appointed to an < org > service of the union in august for as i said earlier these words have special meaning and do not apply in every case where
40	a person is removed from a higher to a lower post applies even when the appointment is temporary or officiating and on the view i take it does not matter whether < org > had what i might call a contractual right to reduce because even if it had it exercised it in a way that evoked evil consequences over and above those that would have ensued in a similar case where there was neither misconduct nor blame we are only concerned with the operative order made by the proper authority competent to make it and with the consequences that ensue from that order it merely says that < name > is appointed to officiate in the appellant place and that on relief the appellant will revert to a lower rank that in itself might be harmless but the order does not stand alone and though the various administrative notings are irrelevant the general manager remarks on them which form the real foundation of the order cannot be ignored because the sting lies there and the evil con sequences of which i speak flow from them i say this because quite obviously the constitutional guarantees of art it was virtually admitted in the arguments before us that a man who is reduced in rank for misconduct for a particular period say one year or two years is being punished and therefore art i do not mean to imply that the reasons that lead to an order of reduction are relevant when there is a contractual right to act in a particular way nor do i mean to imply that a mere recording of disappointment or dissatisfaction would attract art it is here that i venture to dissent with the very greatest respect from my lord construction of art if i read his judgment aright i gather that his view and that of my learned brothers is that art is confined to the penalties prescribed by the various rules and that one must look to all the relevant rules to determine whether the order is intended to operate as a penalty or not with deep respect i do not think that the gist of the matter is either the form of the action or the procedure followed nor do i think it is relevant to determine what operated in the mind of a particular officer the real test is do they in fact ensue as a consequence of the order made i would allow the appeal with costs in accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeal is dismissed with costs [SEP]
41	[CLS] in this petition she claimed one of two reliefs she set up her sale and asked that the property should be released from attachment in the alternative she asked that even if the sale should be held to be invalid as against the attaching decree holder the execution sale should be directed to be held subject to the mortgage in her favour it appears from the endorsement on ex that the decree holder himself had referred in his sale proclamation to the mortgage in the plaintiff favour but suggested that it was supported by consideration only to the extent of rs when the matter carne on for final disposal the executing court held that the sale having been effected subsequent to the attachment was invalid as against the decree holder and it directed the sale to be held subject to the mortgage referred to by the decree holder the result of the execution sale was that the plaintiff was deprived of possession of items and to of the plaint schedule and retained possession only of items and the plaintiff accordingly filed this suit for the recovery of the amount due under the mortgage contending that as the sale had failed he was entitled to fall back upon the mortgage the learned subordinate judge gave effect to this contention and dismissed the suit the seventh defendant raised other contentions which formed the subject matter of the other issues raised in the case one of them was a plea of partial discharge which forms the subject matter of the fourth issue finally there was a question of the amount which the plaintiff was entitled to recover in view of the fact that he still retains as vendee two items of the hypotheca so far as the lower < org > dismissed the plaintiff suit we are unable to concur in its decision as we have already stated the plaintiff put forward alternative claims in his claim petition one on foot of the sale in his favour and the other on foot of the mortgage the < org > rejected the claim based on the sale but upheld the claim based on the mortgage neither party took steps to impeach that order and it became conclusive between the claimant and the decree holder in the money suit the < org > accordingly purported to sell only the equity of redemption and the decree holder who became the auction purchaser having purchased only the equity of redemption could convey only that interest to the present seventh defendant the claim petition there was dismissed as preferred too late and as no suit was brought by the claimant under order rule civil procedure code that order became final it was in those circumstances impossible to imply any adjudication that the claim founded on the mortgage was well founded the learned judges laid stress on the fact that even in the claim petition the claim based on the mortgage was never put forward and that the
42	claimant insisted that the mortgage had been discharged by the sale deed in his favour the conclusion reached in that case that the mortgage had been extinguished has largely been based upon this ground in the application of this principle of presumed intention it makes no difference whether the third party is allowed to claim in preference to the sale on the ground of his being a subsequent encumbrancer or on the ground of his being an attaching decree holder but if in pursuance of the attachment the properties are brought to sale in execution the vendee is deprived of his rights under the sale to the extent to which the properties are sold in execution and we think that there is no meaning in saying that even to this extent the sale is operative as between the vendor and the vendee the sale was there made to the father of the mortgagee and the father was a member of a joint hindu family with the mortgagee by taking a conveyance of the equity of redemption in favour of trustees for the benefit of the prior mortgagee and added that in india it was unnecessary to resort to this conveyancing device and as a rule of equity the principle of presumed intention to keep the mortgage alive might be applied it only lays down a general rule of presumed intention and where the later conveyance will be inoperative as against any intermediate right whether founded on an encumbrance or on an attachment the principle must be held equally to apply this question had to be considered in respect of the effect of an intermediate attachment as in the present case and their lordships observed at it is idle to contend that there was any intention to extinguish the old mortgages for the benefit of the execution creditor or any purchaser at the sheriff sale we must accordingly hold that the plaintiffs claim under the suit mortgage has not been extinguished by the subsequent sale and that it is enforceable in the events that have happened this is made clear by the use of the words mortgage referred to by the decree holder instead of words like mortgage admitted by the decree holder it remains to deal with two other questions raised by mr < name > on behalf of the seventh defendant this relates to a plea of discharge it being the seventh defendant case that in or about april he paid to the plaintiff a sum of rs though the learned sub judge has not discussed in detail the evidence bearing upon this question he has clearly indicated that he was not impressed by the evidence adduced in support of the plea of discharge we have been taken by mr < name > through the relevant portions of the oral evidence and we see no reason to come to a different conclusion it is very doubtful if at or about this time he had the money to pay at
43	all < name > whose help has been availed of to support this story apparently because he had to receive some money from the plaintiff is the son in law of the seventh defendant brother and assuming it to be true that he had to receive a sum of rs from the plaintiff and did receive it about this time we are not by any means satisfied that there is any connection between that transaction and the alleged payment by the seventh defendant to the plaintiff the second issue raised the question of the accountability of the plaintiff for the profits received by her from the lands which had been purchased by the seventh defendant as we do not propose to decide the question as an abstract question of law in this case we do not think it necessary to refer to the cases in detail for instance the statement that a purchase by a prior mortgagee in execution of a decree obtained in his suit without impleading the puisne mortgagee therein is a nullity and will not be effective even to pass the title of the mortgagor as against the puisne mortgagee seems to us too broadly stated in the circumstances of the present case and in view of the fact that a petition has been filed before us on behalf of the seventh defendant for relief under the agriculturists relief act iv of we think it best to hold that no accounting is necessary and it would be more equitable to say that after rd october the plaintiff is not entitled to claim interest as against the seventh defendant to the extent of the proportion of the mortgage debt recoverable from the properties in the seventh defendant possession in this view there is no occasion in our opinion to deal with the petition under madras act iv of either as the plaintiff has become the owner of the equity of redemption in some of the items of the mortgage property the mortgage must be held to have been split up and the plaintiff will be entitled to a decree only for a proportionate share of the mortgage debt as against the properties purchased by the seventh defendant the lower < org > will ascertain the amount due for principal and interest as per terms of the mortgage bond on rd october the date on which the seventh defendant vendor became the < org > auction purchaser out of that amount there will be a decree for sale of the properties purchased in that < org > sale by the seventh defendant vendor for an amount bearing the same proportion to the mortgage debt due on that date as the said properties bear to the entirety of the mortgaged properties valued as on the date of the mortgage the appeal is allowed and the case will be sent back to the lower court to give effect to the above directions and

50	for when the < org > creates a < org > without appeal it is presumed that certiorari lies to restrain excess of jurisdiction the exception allowed by this able advocate implies that he felt he could not contend for a certiorari where the remedy intended by the law was an appeal and where there were not some special circumstances in the case making that remedy inapplicable or ineffectual or else such as to place the case altogether outside the intention and scope of the privative clause that this conception of the grounds and limits of interference was historically a correct one is easily shown by reference to the earlier authorities blewitt re < org > in that case the allegation was that the justices had convicted without any evidence at all yet as they had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the conviction was formally valid < org > refused a certiorari and < name > it will be refused on such a ground as that the party seeking to get an inquisition into compensation quashed lies allowed the time to expire within which he could have got an award set aside under the same lands clauses consolidation act the queen < name > it does not appear indeed that the principles now recognized were always strictly adhered to in the earlier english cases and in eaton it could be argued that a certiorari issued of course but in that case it was definitely laid down that a cause must be shown the object of the writ is to prevent a failure of justice and it is granted only where there is no other specific remedy and in another case where a judgment creditor complained that an inferior < org > refused to allow him to sign judgment it was pointed out that there was a remedy by writ of error and the < org > added of conyngham it is our constant practice to refuse the writ of mandamus to a party who has another remedy which the plaintiff in this case certainly has still however if he had once heard the case on the merits though no appeal lay yet no mandamus it was held could be issued however erroneous his decision to compel him to rehear the case on its merits < name > < name > jur it was urged for the directors that notwithstanding this provision the < org > would not by mandamus enforce the performance of what it did not consider a legal duty but lord < name > said this is an objection which the < org > of directors ought to submit to the decision of the privy < org > as far as we are concerned it is perfectly alieni fori and upon which we therefore sedulously
51	abstain from pronouncing any opinion afterwards the directors appealed to the privy < org > and the decision having been against them the rule for a mandamus was made absolute in this case the < org > having a general power to enforce legal duties see < name > < org > and < org > ch declined to refrain from exercising the power on an assertion that the alleged duty did not exist and refused to examine that question because the law intended it to be disposed of by appeal to another tribunal < name > says if there has been a real conflict of testimony upon some fact which goes to the question of jurisdiction the < org > will not interfere except upon very strong grounds the judge has then really exercised his discretion but when he has given himself jurisdiction by coming to an erroneous conclusion upon a point of law the case is very different and he is in fact without jurisdiction and has no authority to entertain the question in the same case < name > says on the second point i would refer to < name > < name > where to a declaration in prohibition against a < org > judge which stated that title to land was in question there was a plea alleging that the judge heard the evidence of both parties upon the point and adjudged that title was not in question the plea was demurred to and judgment was given for the plaintiff the ground of the decision being that although the judge must of necessity decide the point for the time his determination was not conclusive as in the analogous case of a plea to the jurisdiction and as there was no writ of error from the < org > the question whether there was jurisdiction or not must be open to one of the superior courts on motion for a prohibition if the value of the land was above there would be good ground for issuing the writ and i am quite prepared to hold that if the evidence upon that point was conflicting that circumstance though not conclusive upon us so as absolutely to deprive as of the discretionary power of granting the prohibition would so far influence us that we should require very strong grounds before we should interfere i think that he was wrong in the conclusion at which he arrived because ho applied a wrong rule of law to the facts and therefore that he had no jurisdiction there was no remedy after a wrong judgment should be delivered and therefore the judges were forced to see whether the facts did or did not on any reasonable construction give jurisdiction as the judge of < org > had supposed this agrees with the view expressed by the same learned judge in < name > < name > quoted in < org > willan at while
52	the opinion of the chief justice is substantially the same as that expressed by him in ex vaughan i according to either view the < org > visitatorial or superintending power of interference is to be very sparingly exercised when another remedy is provided in the regular course and in a case of conflicting evidence as to facts on which the jurisdiction of a tower < org > depends it would except in a very extreme case be held contrary to sound principles to interfere a clause in the constituting act required any objection by a defendant on that ground to be made by special plea and added if the want of jurisdiction be not so pleaded the < org > shall have jurisdiction for all purposes the case of < org > < org > was disposed of on the ground of want of jurisdiction the recorder of liverpool thought that < org > required a time for making up their minds whether to appeal or not against a poor rate which entitled them to a hearing at the nest quarter sessions but one instead of the next quarter sessions it would seem that as the recorder had a general jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal the trial before the recorder apart from any prohibition could not have been regarded as coram non judice and the case would on the principles recognized in < name > ramalinga filial i a at pp the case shows however that the facts may be looked into and appreciated differently in the higher < org > when the very point to be determined the legality or illegality of the course taken by the subordinate < org > depends on that investigation as showing a particular state of things to have existed or not existed the < org > have thus been driven to consider more closely than in former days the extent to which they can properly use their undefined powers in relation to bodies vested with special duties and a discretion requisite to the due performance of them in the case of the attorney general < org > at < name > says it is very important no doubt that all these special jurisdictions and powers which are given to departments of the < org > and other similar bodies should not be exceeded and that such bodies should keep themselves within the jurisdiction which is given to them but as it appears to me it is no less important that we should set them the example of keeping ourselves within our proper jurisdiction and i am of opinion that we have no jurisdiction to sit as judges on appeal from a finding of < org > ok the facts properly brought before them in this matter and that we ought not to try to
53	find reasons for substituting our judgment and decision for theirs the specific relief act i of ch viii in abolishing the writ of mandamus enacts that < org > may require any specific act to be done or forborne within the limits of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction by any inferior < org > but the conditions are imposed a of a wrong to the applicant of a duty clearly incumbent on the inferior < org > consistency of the order sought with justice that the applicant has no other specific and adequate legal remedy and that the remedy given by the order will be complete it is very desirable that there should as far as possible be a complete in the course of his judgment his lordship said it has been urged at the bar that the commissioners and sub commissioners of excise are illiterate and that they are partial and interested men if the < org > has thought fit to commit judicial powers to excise officers of a particular description we can only see that they do not exceed the jurisdiction intrusted to them if they do not exceed their jurisdiction we have no authority to pronounce that they are incompetent or corrupt judges from the consideration we have given to the whole subject the following conclusions may we think be deduced the < org > having called up the record or proceedings of a subordinate < org > will itself investigate the facts on which a jurisdiction has been assumed or declined on which it depends whether the subordinate < org > could or could not legally deal with the matter in question either at all or on the principle to which it has referred the case or according to which its mode of inquiry or of action may or may not have been in contradiction than obedience to the rules of procedure or the principles implied in them to such a material extent as to defeat the purpose of the law where an appeal is provided the court will not interfere by any peremptory order with the ordinary course of adjudication save in cases wherein a defeat of the law and a grave wrong are manifest and are irremediable by the regular procedure where a decree or order of a subordinate < org > is declared by the law to bo for its own purposes final or conclusive though in its nature provisional as subject to displacement by the decree in another more formal suit the < org > will have regard to the intention of the < org > that promptness and certainty should in such cases be in some measure accepted instead of juridical perfection it will rectify the proceedings of the inferior < org > where the extrinsic conditions of its legal activity have plainly been infringed but where the alleged or apparent

61	payable if the intention was to limit the liability to pay additional surcharge to income which can be brought to income tax appropriate language could have been used to convey that simple sense this is so not because additional surcharge is payable by law on non business income but because it is payable on residual income and residual income by definition includes non business income as reduced in fact it consists of the amount of total income as reduced by the amounts mentioned in clauses a and of section this partly is the same argument in a different disguise that an assessee who is not liable to pay income tax cannot be made liable to pay additional surcharge under the finance act we have rejected that contention partly the argument is designed to establish correlation with section of the income tax act by which when any tax interest penalty fine or any other sum is payable in consequence of any order passed under the act < org > office has to serve upon the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable the interpretation put by us on the finance act does no violence to section of the income tax act under which income tax at the rates prescribed by the finance act is to be charged in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the learned judges were in error in holding that section of the finance act does not provide for the levy of a tax other than income tax and that therefore additional surcharge is not payable to the extent of the income which is exempt under section of the income tax act one of the difficulties which the learned judges felt in accepting the revenue contention was that if the additional surcharge mentioned in the finance act of was not partake of the nature of income tax it will not be possible to demand and realise it under the provisions of the income tax act and the notice of demand and recovery proceedings would be vitiated on that account it is a tax on residual income and by reason of the definition contained in section of the act of residual income would include non business income which under the income tax act is charge able to income tax thus the additional surcharge though levied by the finance act independently of the income tax act is but a mode of levying tax on a portion of the assessee income computed in accordance with the definition in section of the act of therefore the notice of demand under section of the income tax act can lawfully call for the payment of amount due from an assessee by way of additional surcharge for these reasons we confirm the judgment of < org > but in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs [SEP]
62	[CLS] a former abuse of trust cannot be pleaded against a trustee who seeks to prevent a repetition of that abuse even if he were formerly implicated in the same indefensible course against which he is seeking to protect the trust property < name > < name > mad there was no issue on estoppel that question has been raised here for the first time to validate such a custom would tend to public mischief in inducing needy incumbents of hereditary religions offices who desire to sell them to give a dishonest recognition to qualifications which in fact were not the qualifications demanded by the nature of the office the offerings made by hindus to a public shrine constitute a public trust in which the trustee can never have any beneficiary interest and any appropriation by them of the same would be a clear breach of trust no custom recognising such appropriation can alter the character of such a transaction or validate the same which lays down the rule that shebaits cannot bequeath their office by will to non shebaits there is great danger in developing superficial analogies as a foreclosure decree can only he made with respect to mortgages of immoveable property the provisions of the transfer of property act which refer to foreclosure of mortgages of immoveable property only and order of the civil procedure code of applying also to mortgages of immoveable property are inapplicable to mortgages of palas there is no provision of indian law for granting a decree for foreclosure in the case of pledge or mortgage of moveables there is also authority for the proposition that alienation of a religious office may be validly made in favour of a person standing in the line of succession and not disqualified by personal unfitness < name > < name > bom this raises the question whether the custom possesses the characteristics deemed essential for the validity of a custom there is no force in the contention that the proof of the existence of the custom should have been carried back by direct evidence to when the first regulations were passed by < org > if not to the year when < org > was established not only ought the < org > to be slow to draw an inference of fact which would defeat a right that has been exercised during so long a period as the present unless such inference is irresistible but it ought to presume everything possible to presume in favour of such a right in any event it is well settled that if the existence of the custom has been proved for a long period the onus lies on the person seeking to disprove the custom to demonstrate its impossibility
63	in this case the mortgagors have entirely failed to meet the evidence of the custom adduced by the plaintiff there is also no room for serious controversy as regards the certainty and continuity of the custom it is indisputable that if a custom be against reason it has no force in law but as explained in co when however it is said that a custom is void because it is unreasonable nothing more is meant than that the unreasonable character of the alleged custom conclusively proves that the usage even though it may have existed from time immemorial must have resulted from accident or indulgence and not from any right conferred in ancient times there is no force in the contention of the respondents that because the custom contravenes the rule that a religious office is inalienable it must be pronounced to be against public policy if this argument were to prevail all customs would be unreasonable since customs in general involve some inconsistency with the general common law of the realm or are contrary to a particular maxim the fact of this inconsistency is not of itself a ground for holding the custom unreasonable and bad < name > < name > a it is not material to consider whether he should not apply the whole of the income for religious and charitable purposes but let us assume that he and every shebait like him who has a pala may be compelled to do so there is also no question that though probably religious offices were originally indivisible they are now deemed partible < name > < name > i bam there is further no question that a pala has not only been deemed heritable and partible it has also been treated as devisable as is illustrated by the case of the mister of the first defendant who obtained a pala under the testamentary devise of her father this again involves the recognition of the transferable character of a pala the exercise of thy right to make a bequest implies an assertion of the right to make a transfer inter vivos it follows consequently that the customary right to make a sale mortgage gift or lease of a pala in favour of persons within a limited circle is closely associated with and possibly developed out of the heritable devisable and partible character of a pala as regards the third question it has been argued on behalf of the mortgagors respondents that as order of the civil procedure code of applies only to mortgages of immoveable property the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree for foreclosure and in this connection reference has been made to < name > < name > i calc there is no substance in this contention is in a very different position from an ordinary mortgagee as he has only a special property in the thing

70	of her sons alienating his share before coming to a partition he then proceeds in this way in my opinion the correct view to take of this right would be to hold that it is an inchoate right as long as no partition is come to amongst the sons and it becomes actually enforceable only when the sons come to a partition or in other words that the right when it becomes enforceable by reason of a partition being come to among the sons is cal enforceable not only as against the song and as regards so much only of the joint property as at the date of partition is in the hands of the sons but also as against any person deriving title from any of the sons and as regards the property to which they may have so derived title subject to certain qualifications and limitations it was held by the < org > that by reason of the sale the interest obtained by the purchaser is subject to the rule of lis pendens and that he cannot stand on a higher footing than that of his vendor and when the partition is made if his vendor was a party to the suit the mother would get a share that right cannot be defeated during the pendency of the suit by one of the sons transferring his interest in favour of a third party but if the mother could get any right in the present suit by reason of the partition that would not be by the right created by the mortgagor but it would arise under the hindu law and i doubt whether the principle enunciated by the appellant would apply to such a case in this case in my opinion the plaintiff had a right to bring the suit for partition at the time when he brought the suit although there had been a preliminary decree for partition the title of the plaintiff to his share of the property was not extinguished by that preliminary decree on mortgage but he had still a subsisting interest in the share of the property by reason of succession to his father now it is contended on behalf of the respondent that defendant is bound by the rule of lis pendens as was applied in the case of < name > fulkumari dassi cal the difficulty in this case is that that principle cannot be applied to this case here defendant has acquired the interest of the plaintiff as well as the defendants who had interest in the property that being so the mother would not be entitled to any share of property no by reason of the fact that her sons had no interest in the property and this property could not be the subject of partition that question cannot arise in a suit for partition and if she has any right the question must be left open to
71	be debated in a subsequent suit the result therefore is that the judgment and preliminary decree of the subordinate judge should be modified to this extent that the suit for partition with regard to property no i the strand road premises should stand dismissed and therefore any claim of defendant will also stand dismissed and the appeal is allowed to this extent [SEP]

79	the concerned persons who had no status within the purview of the definition of employee would become employee it is the < org > again that lays down the conditions of service subject of course to a law made by the appropriate legislature this power to prescribe the conditions of service can be exercised either by making rules under the proviso to article of the constitution or in the absence of such rules by issuing rules instruct ions in exercise of its executive power the court comes into the picture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights statutory provisions rules and other instructions if any governing the conditions of service it was further held no regularisation is thus permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under article of the constitution if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory rules the power to frame regulations is expressly conferred on the board in terms of section of the act if no appointment could be made by the < org > in exercise of its power under article of the constitution of india as the same would be in contravention of the statutory rules there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the < org > or for that matter < org > cannot make an appointment in violation of the act and the regulations framed thereunder it is also not the case of the respondents that they were appointed in accordance with the extant rules regularisation cannot be claimed as a matter of right all actions of the < org > must conform to the constitutional requirements representations have been made to them that after their training was completed they would be absorbed in regular employment of the < org > when the < org > was reeling under a strike of its employees these trainee engineers stood by the < org > to keep up the generation and distribution of electricity and had been assured of absorption the court did not lay down any law that regularization would be directed despite the fact appointments had been made in violation of the rules the bench did not go into the question of validity or otherwise of such a scheme before this court a scheme was submitted in terms whereof the scheme had undertaken to regularize work charged employees employed prior to this court besides the proposals made therein issued certain other directions therein it was held the contention on behalf of the < org > that a rule under article for regularisation of the appointment of a person would be a form of recruitment read with reference to power under article is unsound and unacceptable the executive has the power to appoint that power may have its source in article in the present case the rule which regularised the appointment of the respondent with effect from february notwithstanding any rules can
80	##not be said to be in exercise of power under article first article does not speak of rules whereas article speaks of rules therefore the present case touches the power of the < org > to make rules under article of the nature impeached here secondly when the government acted under article the government cannot be said to have acted also under article in the same breath the two articles operate in different areas counsel on behalf of the respondent contended that regularisation would mean conferring the quality of permanence on the appointment whereas counsel on behalf of the < org > contended that regularisation did dot mean permanence but that it was a case of regularisation of the rules under article ratification or regularisation is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the authority but there has been some non compliance with procedure or manner which does not go to the root of the appointment to accede to such a proposition would be to introduce a new head of appointment in defiance of rules or it may have the effect of setting at naught the rules the said decision has been noticed in various judgments referred to hereinbefore it was observed that if the direct recruitment takes place on one hand and substituted teachers are also directed to be regularized subsequently it would create an enormous problem for the department to accommodate both the categories of persons and in the aforementioned situation in exercise of its power under article of the constitution of india this court with a view to avoid further litigation and also to avoid seemingly conflicting interim orders issued by < org > gave certain directions such directions having evidently been issued by this court in exercise of its power under article of the constitution of india do not constitute a binding precedent even therein the scope and ambit of this court jurisdiction under article vis vis existence of the statue and statutory rules and the constitutional mandate contained in articles and of the constitution of india had not been taken into consideration on the other hand in a series of decisions which we have noticed hereinbefore this < org > has now firmly laid down the law that regularization cannot be a mode of appointment other contentions mr < name > has placed strong reliance upon the provisions of the regularisation of adhoc appointments on posts outside the purview of the public service commission rules purported to have been framed by the state in pursuance of the provisions of clause of article of the constitution of india ii possessed requisite qualifications prescribed for regular appointment as the time of such ad hoc appointment and iii has completed or as the case may be after he has completed three years service shall be

82	the < org > but the < org > did not exercise its power nor the competent authorities of < org > proceeded to appoint employees on the sweet will of the concerned authorities without in any way bothering for the provisions of the act and the rules framed thereunder the officers of the local authorities had a bounden duty not only to act within the four corners of the statute but having regard to the constitutional scheme in mind as appointments had been made de hors the rules and without following the procedures known in law and in flagrant violation of constitutional scheme as laid down in articles and of the constitution of india the appointments although might have been made in exigencies of services they must be held to be wholly illegal and without jurisdiction an attempt has been made by the respondents to show that the income of < org > has increased from rs the availability of funds is not and cannot be a valid ground to make the appointments of persons without proper sanction and creation of posts and cannot be taken to be an excuse to perpetuate illegalities a contention has been raised by mrs < name > that there was no material before the < org > for issuing the impugned instructions insofar as the financial position vis vis the strength of the employees had been taken into consideration it is not necessary for us to go into the aforementioned question inasmuch as we are herein concerned with the legality and or validity of the impugned orders of termination of services and the same having not been done the appointment of the concerned employees were wholly illegal and without jurisdiction and thus void and of no effect ii the < org > had no jurisdiction to frame any scheme for regularization in the pith of the statutory regulations operating in the field any legislation involving appointment or laying down the conditions of service of the employees would require prior sanction of the < org > availability of vacancies and or the fund by themselves would not allow < org > or the < org > to make appointments in flagrant violation of the statutory provisions mr < name > appearing on behalf of the < org > has assured us that the < org > shall look into cases of such employees whose termination has been effected beyond the policy decision taken by the < org > although we do not intend to express any opinion as regards such employees we however direct the < org > and < org > to fill up all existing vacancies strictly in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible and preferably within six months from date in the offers of appointment which may be issued to such temporary or ad hoc employees it shall be
83	made clear that their appointments would be ad hoc in nature and the same shall be co terminus with the appointment of regular employees in view of our findings aforementioned we are of the opinion that the judgment and order dated passed by the learned single judge which has been upheld by the division bench by its order dated does not lay down the law correctly and the judgment and order dated passed by a division bench of the lucknow bench of < org > in writ petition no of lays down the law correctly in the result civil appeal arising out of slp no of is dismissed and other civil appeals filed by the < org > and the state of uttar pradesh as also civil appeal arising out of slp no of filed by the < org > are allowed [SEP]
84	[CLS] the facts as stated in the order under revision show that the value of the property in dispute was perhaps more than rs that court had no jurisdiction to hear the reference the < org > however on hearing the parties came to the view that the word competent means the competent court of territorial jurisdiction and section of the will apply to suits and not to a proceeding and accordingly held that the objection was not tenable in law before however i enter into the discussion of the question raised i think it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure bearing on the subject if the magistrate decides that one of the parties was or should under the second proviso to sub section be treated as being in such possession of the said subject he shall issue an order declaring such party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law and forbidding all disturbance of such possession until such eviction and when he proceeds under the second proviso to sub section may restore to possession the party forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed if the magistrate is of opinion that none of the parties was then in such possession or is unable to decide as to which of them was then in such possession of the subject of dispute he may attach it and draw up a statement of the facts of the case and forward the record of the proceedings to a civil court of competent jurisdiction to decide the question whether any and which of the parties was in possession of the subject of dispute at the date of the order as explained in sub section of section and he shall direct the parties to appear before < org > on a date to be fixed by him these provisions in my opinion make it clear that notwithstanding the reference if any made to < org > for a finding on the point of possession the proceeding itself at no stage is ever transferred as a whole to the civil < org > so much so that on receipt of the opinion from < org > it is again the criminal < org > which finally disposes of that application save in so far as is otherwise expressly provided nothing herein contained shall operate to give any court jurisdiction over suits the amount or value of the subject matter of which exceeds the pecuniary limits if any of its ordinary jurisdiction this shows that the consideration of pecuniary jurisdiction in the case of jurisdiction oi < org > arises in the case of suits alone or at best for that reason in the case of tho proceedings which are in continuation of suits or arise therefrom but in no case in the case of those which are neither suits nor arise therefrom or are connected therewith therefore in my
85	opinion a reference made under section of the code of criminal procedure to < org > not being either a suit or a proceeding as held above cannot be put to any limitation of pecuniary jurisdiction nor there is any indication cither in that section or in section of the code of civil procedure in support of any construction like that that being so the contention raised in this case behalf of the petitioner that the learned munsif to whom the reference was made is not competent to hear it fails the first four cases deal with the pecuniary jurisdiction of a < org > to which a decree is transferred for execution either under section of the code of civil procedure or some such similar provision provided in other acts and the decision in those cases is broadly speaking based on the principle that the word suit as contemplated in section of the code of civil procedure is not limited only to the proceedings in cause up to the passing of the decree hut on the other hand covers all its proceedings including those in execution therefore they are not of any assistance in disposing of the present case in the case reported in air all the reference made to < org > was by a revenue < org > and in those circumstances the question raised was whether the provision of the code of civil procedure applied to that proceeding in answer thereto the learned judges held that it was a proceeding of a character as contemplated under section and therefore the procedure laid down in the code of civil procedure did apply to it so the decision in that case is not based on the consideration of jurisdiction but unfortunately by the time the case came up for decision in the < org > < org > became functus officio in that matter and so the proceeding in the < org > had to be finally disposed of without any relief to the objector yet in the course of discussion their lordships expressed the view that the objection taken on the ground of pecuniary jurisdiction was a valid one but the discussion on this point is rather scanty and is based on the general proposition that the competency of a < org > consists both in territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction without any detailed discussion on the consideration as to whether the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure did at all apply to a case like that therefore these cases do not throw any light on the point raised here lastly our attention has also been drawn by the petitioners to the difficulties which may arise in cases where civil < org > of different grades having the same territorial jurisdiction are found situated in the same area the section as it stands is silent on that point and this certainly may give rise to
86	some unnecessary controversy but on the language as it stands at present it has to be held that in such cases all these < org > will have concurrent jurisdiction and in law the reference to any of them shall be a valid reference it is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs in my opinion the question of pecuniary jurisdiction of < org > in order to make it < org > of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of section of the code of criminal procedure cannot reasonably arise the cases relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner are all of them of a character which could be finally disposed of by < org > to which they were referred either for execution or under the bengal land registration act of or under the revenue law a finding by < org > on the dispute as to which party is in possession is again sent back to < org > which has to pass the final order there is yet another pertinent question of practical value it will in any case give rise to a new proceeding of an incidental character which may be open to challenge in a superior < org > [SEP]
87	[CLS] an application to aside the sale was made and an order passed setting aside the sale on december there was an appeal to the district judge a second appeal to < org > and a letters patent appeal from the judgment in second appeal all these appeals to which the decree holder and the auction purchaser were parties were dismissed the first appeal on november the second appeal on february and the letters patent appeal on september the question arises whether this application is barred by limitation which would depend on whether as contended by the decree holder three years are allowed from the date of setting aside the sale or as contended by the auction purchaser three years from the dismissal of the letters patent appeal on september one of the questions for decision is whether an appeal lay against the order passed under order xxi rule by the district munsif ordering refund of the purchase money on behalf of the appellant three cases have been quoted which directly bear on this question there can be no doubt from a very large number of cases decided in this < org > and in other high < org > s that the auction purchaser can be looked upon as a representative of a judgment debtor or decree holder and further that when there is a matter in dispute between the decree holder and the judgment debtor it makes no difference that the actual application which raises the matter is made by a stranger there is very little discussion even in that judgment and the many cases referred to therein show that there was a very considerable conflict of authority on this point before < name > < name > a awn was decided mlj mwn mlt fb there was a conflict between the auction purchaser in execution of a money decree who was a stranger and the auction purchaser decree holder in execution of a mortgage decree there the judgment debtor in a separate suit contended that the auction purchaser had trespassed on some of his lands which had not been sold but the < org > found that although the lands in question were not the subject matter of the mortgage or of the decree and were not even sold yet the < name > had by mistake actually delivered them to the auction purchaser and that there was no trespass it was held following the < org > case that this was a dispute in which the judgment debtor and the decree holder were adversely interested and that it did not matter that it was the auction purchaser with whom the judgment debtor was actually contending it was therefore held that the judgment debtor should have raised this matter in execution and that a separate suit did mad lw mwn there was a sale but before confirmation had been ordered the decree itself was set aside in appeal
88	the sale was confirmed and an application was then put in to set aside the sale under sections and order xxi rule it was held that they were and that therefore section did apply and the matter could be gone into in execution it is not difficult think to distinguish these three cases from the present case for in all three of them it was very clear that the matters in dispute did arise in execution mlj mwn mlt fb that a stranger purchaser at a < org > auction is entitled and bound to have any question relating to the satisfaction of the decree decided under section civil procedure code the judgment goes on to discuss the < org > case prosonno kumar sanyal kali das sanyal ia sar it then refers to a recent decision of the same < org > in < name > < name > a ind there is admittedly no question outstanding between the parties except that which has been decided in this appeal and to require the question to be now tried out in a regular suit would be merely to put the parties to unnecessary expense air all alj this question does seem to have been left in some uncertainty but on a general examination of the current of cases bearing on the interpretation of section there is certainly a very strong tendency to give it a wide application and to bring within its scope questions arising between the parties to the suit and the auction purchaser as has been pointed above the matter now in dispute does to some extent relate to the discharge and satisfaction of the decree when this appeal first came up for hearing it was admitted that the article of the limitation act to be applied was but the learned advocate for the auction purchaser now suggests that the there is no direct authority but the matter has been argued on the analogy of an application under order xxi rule civil procedure code to an application under section civil procedure code for restitution there has been a considerable conflict of authority whether applications for restitution are governed by article or article but the weight of authority is that they are governed by article however there is authority in madras for the position that applications under section relate to execution and that article therefore applies apart from this change we see no ground for holding that < org > intended to make any departure in the procedure by which restitution is to be obtained the language of section of the code would cover all cases of restitution even apart from that it is not difficult to see that restitution does arise by way of execution for in executing the decree of the < org > which reverses a decree of a lower < org > account has necessarily to be
89	taken of any changes in the positions of the parties that have taken place since the passing of the decree that has been reversed for example if one < org > states that a should hand over possession to and he does so in execution and the appellate < org > states that possession should be with a it is in execution of the appellate < org > decree that possession is given back to a by it is difficult to apply similar reasoning to an application under order xxi rule rule merely gives the auction purchaser an equitable relief by way of returning to him the money that he has already paid into < org > because of some order passed under order xxi rules to depriving him of land for which he has already paid < name > held that section does not apply only to cases where a decree or order is reversed in appeal but also where an order is made of no effect by virtue of other proceedings so that when a claimant became successful in a suit filed under order xxi rule the < org > was empowered under section to put all the parties including the auction purchaser in the same position as they would have been if the claim had been upheld in the first instance there are no grounds for holding that article applies to an application under order xxi rule assuming as was originally conceded that article is the provision of the limitation act that governs this application it would certainly follow from a plain reading of article that time began to run from the date of the passing of the original order setting aside the sale it is however argued on the analogy of orders passed on applications under section or for the passing of a final decree that it is from the date of the decree of the final < org > confirming the decree of the first court that time must be reckoned air all alj sb to the effect that the essential condition to the making of a final decree is the existence of a preliminary decree which has become conclusive between the parties when that decree is passed it is that decree and only that which can be made final between the parties another group of applications upon which there has been considerable authority is that of applications for restitution under section which in the opinion of most of < org > comes within the scope of article as has already been pointed out an application for restitution can be looked upon as one arising in execution of a decree and some judges while holding that article applied have nevertheless been of opinion than such an application was akin to one in execution and so held on the analogy of article that the < org > must have intended that where there were appallate decrees the decree of the
90	final < org > was the decree from which time should be calculated in view of the fact that article expressly lays down that time should be reckoned from the date of the last decree whereas article does not bay so it is rather difficult to argue by analogy from article to article the main current of authority on this point is undoubtedly to the effect that time does run from the date of the first decree the matter was very fully considered by a full bench of < org > in < name > < name > a ind aij ra and the majority of the judges found themselves unable to accept the argument that the proceedings were akin to execution proceedings and that the same principle that time should be reckoned from the date of the final < org > decree should be followed if it was the operative decree of the final < org > that had to be taken into account in reckoning the time allowed for applying for a final decree then for the same reason it would be the decree of the final court of appeal that should be taken into account in reckoning the time for restitution proceedings their lordships there pointed out that as in india an original decree is not suspended by the presentation of an appeal nor is its operation interrupted when the decree on appeal is one of dismissal and that as consideration failed at the date of the first decree the mere fact that an appeal had been filed did not suspend the cause of action and that throughout the pendency of the proceedings in < org > s time was running against the plaintiff this case is of very great importance and has been discussed in all the cases relating to applications for restitution whichever way courts have eventually decided it has been taken as an authority by the allahabad and calcutta < org > with regard to restitution proceedings on the ground that as the section clearly says that the period of limitation under article is three years from the time when the right to apply accrues time must be calculated from the date on which the right accrued because the cause of action is not interrupted by the subsequent filing of an appeal the suit was filed more than three years from the date of the original decree but less than three years from the date of the appellate decree in that case the judges felt themselves bound by the < org > decision just referred to they say that in construing the provisions of the limitation act equitable considerations are out of place and the strict grammatical meaning of the words is the only safe guide in this view we are of opinion that the right to apply accrued as soon as the order of the district judge was

93	injunction restraining the defendants from making any alteration in the property and from damaging the same as long as the property continued in their possession as tenants the permission of the district magistrate for a suit for ejectment postulated under section of the rent control and eviction act relates to cases which are not covered by clauses a to of that section clause covers a case where the tenant has wilfully caused or per mitted to be caused substantial damage to the accommodation clause covers a case where the tenant has without the permission in writing of the landlord made or permitted to be made any such construction as in the opinion of the court has materially altered the accommodation or is likely substantially to diminish its value in the present case there is concurrent finding of fact of the two courts below that the tenants wilfully caused or permitted to be caused substantial damage to the accommodation and they without the permission in writing of the landlord made constructions which materially altered the accommodation the present case was therefore covered by clauses and of section and the permission of the district magistrate would not therefore be necessary had been occupying the cinema hall as tenants that they had made substantial alterations in the building which caused damage to the building to a great extent that he did not wish them to continue in occupation of the building the more so because after the abolition of the zamindari which was his main source of income his resources would be considerably affected and he wanted the accommodation for himself in order to start some business < name > requested the district magistrate to grant him the permission to file a civil suit against the occupiers for their eviction the district magistrate granted the permission which was conveyed by the rent control and eviction officer of muzaffarnagar to < name > permission will be awarded to the owner to file a civil suit for the ejectment of the tenant hence under the orders of the district magistrate you are hereby accorded permission to file a civil suit against your tenant sri debi prasad under section of the rent control and eviction act in regard to the permission aforesaid it has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the lower appellate court view that this permission was defective because it was in favour of only one of the landlords namely < name > and against only one of the tenants namely < name > was not based upon a correct appreciation of matter it was further held that where it is mainfest that all the plaintiffs landlords who were interested in the matter brought the suit after serving a notice on the tenants to vacate the premises in suit it will be deemed that the plaintiff who obtained the permission acted as agent on
94	behalf of the other plaintiffs we have quoted the order of the district magistrate and in that order the district magistrate granted permission to the owner to file a civil suit for the ejectment of the tenant by forfeiture that is to say in case the lessee breaks an express condition which provides that on breach thereof the lessor may re enter and the lessor gives notice in writing to the lease of his intention to determine the lease on the expiration of a notice to determine the lease duly given by one party to the other under clause of section a breach of condition only makes the lease voidable the forfeiture is not complete unless and until the lessor gives notice that he has exercised his option to determine the lease in < name > < name > all it has been explained that when a forfeiture of a lease is incurred the lease is voidable and not void and in those circumstances the giving of a notice to quit may recognise the subsistence of the lease and may amount to a waiver of forfeiture but when the tenancy is determined by a notice to quit the position is entirely different under section of the transfer of property act a forfeiture under section clause is waived by acceptance of rent which has become due since the forfeiture or by any other act on the part of the lessor showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting provided that the lessor is aware that the forfeiture has been incurred provided also that where rent is accepted after the institution of a suit to eject the lessee on the ground of forfeiture such acceptance is not waiver instances of such acts showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting are a demand of rent accruing due since the breach a suit for such rent or acceptance of a sum paid into court as damages for breach of covenant to repair alleged to have been committed during the term keeping in view the principles stated above we now proceed to examine the facts of this case there was no express condition in the terms of the compromise decree dated in suit no of of the court of munsif muzaffarnagar referred to above which provided that on breach thereof the lessor may re enter even if an express condition like that is to be inferred from the compromise decree emanating from the implied covenants mentioned in clauses and of section of the transfer of property act a breach of the condition only makes the lease voidable and the forfeiture woiild not be complete unless and until the lessor gave notice that he had exercised his option to determine the lease under section clause of the act the forfeiture under section clause in the present case must be deemed to have been waived not only by acceptance of rent which became due since
95	the forfeiture but by the act on the part of the lessor in the subsequent suit no of brought against the tenants showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting it appears that in suit no of aforesaid a compromise was entered into between the parties on when suit no of was taken up for hearing an application which is paper no on the record was made on behalf of the defendants in that application it was stated that the plaintiffs in their suit no of of the court of the < org > had unequivocally compromised the ground of claim namely that the defendants tenants had materially altered and damaged the premises of the plaintiff and had accepted rs from the defendants by way of compensation for the said alterations and that in the light of the above fact the plea of damages or alteration of the premises did no longer remain open to the plaintiff in the present suit this application was disposed of by the learned additional civil judge by an order dated by which he stated that suit no of was compromised between the parties on the understanding that that case as also the present suit no of shall be compromised together that as a matter of fact the compromise of both these suits had been settled in open court by the parties and thereafter the first suit was compromised on a payment of certain sum while the terms of the compromise in the second suit were left to be recorded in writing and the completed compromise was to be filed the next day that on the next day the parties informed the court that the corn promise talks had fallen through on account of some misunderstanding and that it would therefore be wrong to contend that the compromise of the first suit should in any way lead to the shutting out of any evidence in this case upon that view of the matter the learned additional civil judge rejected application no the learned additional civil judge allowed evidence to be led on the question of material alteration or damage to the building and he held independently of the compromise decree in the earlier suit no of that there was material damage or alteration to the building as damages for the alterations in the building amounted in our opinion to an act on the part of the lessor showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting in these circumstances and in view of section of the transfer of property act the notice given under section clause must be deemed to have been waived with the express or implied consent of the persons to whom it was given by an act of the persons giving it showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting upon this view of the matter although we have disagreed with some of the findings of the lower appellate court the refusal to grant the relief for e
96	##jectment must be upheld there remains only one other point to be determined and that is whether the present suit was barred by order ii rule of the code of civil procedure as a result of the finding reached by us namely that the notice given under section clause must be deemed to have been waived and there was no determination of the lease and further that an intention on the part of the lessor to treat the lease as subsisting was manifest by their own action or conduct this second appeal in our opinion has got no force and we accordingly dismiss it with costs [SEP]

98	the first was that the collector had no jurisdiction to go into the matter since the assistant collector had already once gone into the matter and given a finding that these seals are to be classified under tl get and in the absence of any further or better material the collector was not entitled to come to a different conclusion except by way of review under the provisions of section a of the central excises and salt act as it then stood in view of the said circumstances we agree with the learned counsel that the collector had no jurisdiction to differ from the earlier conclusion of the assistant collector except by way of taking proceeding for review of the earlier order under section a shri < name > further contends that so far as the demand for payment of duty is concerned the collector had no jurisdiction under section a to do so as pointed out by him section a conferred jurisdiction on the assistant collector to determine the amount of duty in terms of notice issued earlier by the proper central excise officer therefore we are convinced that so far as demand for duty is concerned the collector had no power in the instant case accordingly this appeal is allowed and the order of the collector is set aside with consequential relief if any i have carefully perused the order written by learned brother < name > in the above view of the matter it does not appear to be necessary in my opinion to consider the other contentions raised by < name > counsel for the appellants and discussed in para and of < name > order and i do not propose to go into them i also agree that rule has in any event no application to the facts of the present case i agree with brother < name > < name > dated member final order the order bearing no dated issued by the < org > as disposing of this appeal had been recalled vide misc [SEP]
99	[CLS] the lorry bearing registration no mdj owned by the st respondent is the vehicle which was involved in the accident the two respondents contested the petition and the < org > came to the conclusion that the accident was not due to any negligence or rashness on the part of the dirver of the lorry that it was an inevitable accident due to an unforeseen mechanical defect and that therefore the claimants are not entitled to any compensation the < org > also gave a finding that if the claimants are entitled to compensation on the ground that the accident was a result of rash or negligent driving of the vehicle a sum of rs but the petition came to be dismissed on the abound that there was no rashness or negligence on the part of the driver of the lorry the first question that arises for consideration is whether the accident was as a result of negligence there is a tea shop called gopal tea stall east of the pavement we have also the evidence of < name > the police officer who visited the scene sometime after the accident and he has drawn a plan as per exhibit showing the tyre marks and other particulars < name > the driver of the lorry stated that he was driving the lorry from north to south that the lorry was empty i without any load that two bullock carts were going ahead of the lorry that he overtook the said two bullock carts by going to his right side western side of the road that after he so overtook the two carts he wanted to bring the lorry to the centre of the road that then the steering began to wobble that the steering wheel turned left and could not be brought to the normal position that when he applied the brakes they failed and that therefore the vehicle got over the platform on the eastern side of the road and dashed against the tea shop only after which the vehicle came to a stop there are two aspects of the question he should further show that he took reasonable care to avoid such mechanical defect there is no evidence as to whether the sub axle nuts broke or slipped < name > in motor claims cases th edition page points out that if an accident is due to a latent defect which is not discoverable by reasonable care there is no negligence in the case of mechanical break down unless the defendant satisfies the < org > that he arranged periodical check up and carried out necessary repanis regularly and that he did everything in his power to eliminate mechanical unsoundness the break down would be only a neutral factor and not a valid deferce in the present case there
100	is absolutely no evidence to show that the st respondent took any care to avoid the mechanical defect therefore i think the st respondent has not discharged his burden of rebutting the presumption arising from the doctrine of res the next point to be considered is whether the appellants who are the brothers and sister of < name > since deceased are persons entitled to claim compensation under section a of the motor vehicles act hereinafter referred to as the act per contra the contention on behalf of the appellants is that the provisions of the fatal accidents act have no application to claim before < org > that the provisions under the motor vehicles act give a right to all legal representatives of the deceased to maintain to claim for compensatior that the term legal representatives occurring in section a of the act would take in the brothers and sister of a deceased who died a bachelor and that therefore their claim cannot be negatived on the ground that they are not dependants as defired under section a of the fatal accidents act even in respect of claims before < org > one has necessarily to look to the provisions of the fatal accidents act because the provisions of the motor vehicles act do not create substantive rights but they any only procedural in character though they are not entitled to compensation for loss of benefit as they are not dependants under section a of the fatal accidents act they would be entitled to claim compensation towards loss of estate of the deceased as persons who represent his estate the contention on behalf of the appellants proceed on the footing that sections to of the act create substantive rights and that they are not merely procedural law under which persons can claim compensation for either death or injury caused by tortious acts undoubtedly the substantive right to claim compensation is only under the general law of torts it cannot be disputed and as a matter of fact it is not disputed that either an injured or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be should establish that the accident was as a result of rashness or negligence on the part of the owner of the motor vehicle or his servant before ever they can claim compensation in espect of the accident that being so merely because section a says that either the injured person or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be can file application for compensation and section says that < org > may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to be just it cannot be claimed that any new right is created under these provisions the < org > making an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just has naturally to look to the law of torts
101	in determining such compensation if the owner of the vehicle is not a tort feaser then in spite of the accident causing either injury or death as the case may be no compensation can be awarded by the < org > therefore the mere fact that the section says that the < org > would determine the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just does not mean that any new right is created to the claimants it is stated that in the latest amendment of the act section has been so amended in order to create an absolute liability in respect of injuries caused to passengers in public service vehicles section as it originally stood stated that the insurance must be a policy which insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub section against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place there is also a proviso to this clause but that need not be referred to now in order to comply with the requirements of this chapter a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub section i against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place ii against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place as in the new clause i it is stated that the insurance is to he against any liability which may be incurred by the person or classes of persons specified in the policy but clause ii simply says that the insurance is to be against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle without referring to any liability which may be incurred by the person or classes of persons insured in respect of such death of or bodily injury to any passenger it is said that under the abovesaid clause viz in paragraph of the said objects and reasons it is stated that the bill seeks to provide for covering of passenger risks for public service vehicles irrespective of the culpability of the owner or driver of such vehicle for any accident in which it may be involved provided that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the victim though the statement of objects and reasons mentioned above supports the above view whether the said object has been achieved or not has to he examined assuming without
102	deciding that the new section creates an absolute liability in respect of injury or death to passengers in a public service vehicle that has nothing to do with the present question for two grounds viz this amendment comes into effect only in the year and the absolute liability if any is only in respect of passengers in a public service vehicle if really the present section creates an absolute liability in respect of passengers in a public service vehicle that fact would only highlight the position that in respect of other claimants there is no question of absolute liability and that the claimants can succeed only by proving that the injury or the death as the case may be was due to tortious act on the part of the owner of the motor vehicle either directly or vicariously if one has necessarily to look to the law of torts then it must be remembered that before the coining into force of the legal representatives suits act xii of and the indian fatal accidents act xiii of under the maxim of actio personalis moritur cum persona no action could be maintained by any one in respect of the death of a person even though the death bad been caused by the defendant by committing a tortious act the result was that the person who caused the death of other cannot be sued in tort though if death had not been caused but only injury had been caused the injured would be entitled to sue and recover damages for the tortious act under section a of the fatal accidents act a new right is created in favour of certain defendants who are named therein to maintain an action or suit for damages in respect of the death of a person under the legal representatives suits art xii of which corresponds to the law reforms act in england the cause of action in respect of loss to the estate of a person whose death had been caused by tortious act is made to survive and be available to the executors administrators or representatives of the deceased if the person wronged does not die as a result of the wrong doing under the general law of torts he always has the right to maintain an action for loss of estate i will come to the question what exactly is the loss of estate a little later that is the first part of section a of the said act which says provided always that not more than one action or suit shall be brought for and in respect of the same subject matter of complaint if a person dies of a tortious act there could not be one action for the loss of benefit to one of the dependants as contemplated under section a of the said act and a separate action for loss of such benefit to another dependent though a separate suit or
103	action for the loss of estate can be brought by the executors or administrators or representatives of the deceased as the case may be the second part of section of the fatal accidents act says provided that in any such action or suit the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased it may he seen that this provision contained in section of the fatal accidents act itself is procedural in character as it does not create any substantive right in the executor administrator or representative of the deceased to claim pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased but as the law originally stood such right to claim pecuniary loss to the estate would have died with the deceased and no action could be maintained by the deceased executor administrator or representative section of the fatal accidents act only says that the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased in a suit or action brought on behalf of the dependants of the deceased for less of benefit as contemplated under section a thus it is dear that section of the fatal accidents act itself does not create any right but it is only an enabling provision saying that if there is an action or suit for loss of benefit to the dependants the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for pecuriary loss to the estate of the deceased in the same action but the exception is in respect of personal injuries causing the death of the patty in case of personal injuries causing the death of the party the cause of action does survive to the executors or administrators of the deceased but for that act under the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona the cause of action even in respect of injuries causing the death of the person would die with him there is no distinction between a motor accident causing fatal injuries to a person and other accidents or any other act causing such fatal injuries regarding rights and liabilities of the parties the liability of the defendant in all such cases including cases of motor accidents is founded only on the law of torts under section of the motor vehicles act as it stood before the amendment of the year the state governments had been empowered to appoint persons to investigate and report on motor accidents the present provisions contained in sections to came into effect on february it is stated that the original provision had not helped persons of limited means in preferring claims on account of injury or death because a < or
104	##g > decree has to be obtained before the obligation of an insurance company to meet the claims can be enforced and it is therefore proposed to empower state governments to appoint < org > to determine and award damages there can be no doubt therefore that the provisions cortained in sections to of the motor vehicles act which speak of the constitution of < org > and how applications to such tribunals should be made and disposed of relate only to procedure and they have nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties it is needless to stress that the substantive right of a claimant and the liability of the defendant have to be determined only as per the law of torts and that but for the legal representatives suits act and the fatal accidents act both of the year there would be no cause of action available to any ore in respect of injuries resulting in the death of the injured till the recent amendment of the act by act lvi of section stated that < org > is to be constituted for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles if a person goes on a cycle and he is knocked down by a motor car due to the negligence or rashness on the part of the motor car driver then the person who is so knocked down would be entitled to claim the value of the damaged cycle apart from other damages section no of the act as it stood before the recent amendment of did not specifically provide for < org > going into the question such damages to property the question arose whether the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain even a claim in respect of damage to property in a motor accident he filed a suit in the civil court for damages towards his personal injuries as well as damages to the cycle as < org > had been constituted the civil court returned the plaint holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain any part of the claim on a revision against such an order < name > as he then was held that in so far as the claim in respect of personal injuries is concerned sections and of the motor vehicles act make it clear that the claim for bodily injury is triable only by < org > having territorial jurisdiction but the jurisdiction of such < org > is limited by the terms of the statute and did not cover claims of damages to property and that therefore the civil court had jurisdiction to try the suit in so far as that relates to the claim of compensation for demage to the property section no before the recent amendment read as
105	follows a state government may by notification in the official gazette constitute one or more motor accidents claims tribunals hereinafter referred to as claims tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles the words motor vehicles occurring in the above sub section have now been substituted with other words and a proviso has also been added and section as amended reads as follows a state government may by notification in the official gazette constitute one or more motor accidents claims tribunals hereinafter referred to as claims tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles or damage to any property of a third party so arising or both provided that where such claim includes a claim for compensation in respect of damage to property exceeding rupees two thousand the claimant may at his option refer the claim to a civil < org > for adjudication and where a reference is so made < org > shall have no jurisdiction to enertain any question relating to such claim the civil < org > and < org > would have concurrent jurisdiction as it were and the claimant in such a case would have the option to choose the forum therefore there can be no doubt that sections to prescribe only a special forum in the place of the civil < org > in respect of claims relating to motor accidents and those sections have nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties before dealing with the case law on the point i would like to dispose of another aspect the said rules are purported to be made under section of the act but section does not really give power to < org > to make any rules it is section a that gives power to < org > to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of sections to i take it that the motor accidents claims tribunals rules are made under the above provision viz rule of the said rules says legal representative shall have the meaning assigned to it under clause of section of the code of civil procedure it takes in not only administrators executors and heirs but all other persons who represent the estate of the deceased the definition says that the terms include even persons who intermeddle with the estate of the deceased even so this definition would not take in all the persons who would be entitled to file claim as per the provisions contained in the fatal
106	accidents act and the legal representatives suits act under the legal representatives suits act an action can be maintained by an executor administrator or representative of the deceased person in respect of pecuniary loss to the estate the claim for loss of benefit as well as that for loss of the estate can be brought not only by an executor or administrator but also by a representative of the deceased as already pointed out if there is a claim for loss of benefit to the dependants mentioned in section a of the fatal accidents act a claim for loss to the estate the cause of action for which claim is preserved by the legal representatives suits act can be inserted in the same claim i am also of the opinion that the term legal representative occurring in section a of the act takes in persons covered by the term representative occurring in section a of the fatal accidents act but in my opinion the term representative occurring in section a of the fatal accidents act has different connotations and the term takes in even persons who do not represent the estate of the deceased aiyar law lexicon it is stated that the ordinary legal sense of the terra representatives without the addition of legal or personal is executors and administrators but contextually representatives may be taken to mean as next of kin or the descendants therefore it is clear that the term representative or legal representative should ordinarily denote a person who represents the estate of the deceased but the said terms may denote even next of kin if the context warrants it we are of the opinion that the term representative occurring in section a of the fatal accidents act means next of kin and not merely heirs or persons who represent the estate of the deceased the claim made on behalf of them need not be as representative of the estate of the deceased the father of the deceased as well as the grandfather of the deceased is a dependant entitled to claim compensation or less of benefit though of course there must be proof that but for the death of the deceased he would have been receiving some benefit from him and the quantum of compensation has to be determined in favour of each dependant separately according to the nature and extent of dependency but such father or grandfather may not be an heir if the deceased has left a widow or mother or child and the parties are hindus and he may not also be a person representing the estate of the deceased as contemplated under section of the code of civil procedure though it is clear that for a person to be one representing the estate of the deceased he need not necessarily be an administrator executor or heir still he must have something to do with the estate of the deceased therefore if the father or grandfather who is
107	not an heir has no possession of any part of the estate of the deceased and he has nothing to do with such estate he may not be a person representing the estate of the deceased in any sense of the term that means if the term representative occurring in section a of the fatal accidents act is understood as a person representing the estate of the deceased a father or grandfather of the deceased may not be in a position to bring an action in his own name for loss of benefit that being so the term representative occurring in that act should refer to persons who represent the estate of the deceased and that need not take in next of kin who would be dependants of the deceased under the fatal accidents act but may not be persons who represent the estate of the deceased therefore the word representative occurring in section a and the same term occurring in the legal representatives suits act need not have the same meaning in fact the term representative occurring in section of the fatal accidents act has to be understood only in the same way as in the legal representatives suits act i as a person representing the estate of the deceased for that section speaks of claim relating to the pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased the above conclusion of mine would mean that the term representative occurring in different sections of the fatal accidents act would have different meanings while under section a the term representative should refer to next of kin who are dependants in section the same term has to refer to persons representing the estate of the deceased but when the term has to be understood according to context we do not see any difficulty in placing such construction on the term which differs from one section to another sections to of the act being only procedural in character and having nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties do not make any reference to either loss of benefit or loss to the estate as heads on which compensation can be claimed in the case of a person whose death was caused by a motor accident only compensation for loss to the estate of the deceased the cause of action for which is preserved by the legal representatives suits act and loss of benefit to the dependants which right has been created by section a of the fatal accidents act can be claimed in case of death of a person in any accident including a motor accident it is in the above context one has to see the sense in which the term legal representative is used in section a of the act the term legal representative therefore should necessarily include not only persons who represent the estate of the deceased who can claim loss to the estate of the deceased and the next of kin who are mentioned as dependants under section
108	a of the fatal accidents act who can claim compensation for loss of benefit to themselves whether they represent the estate of the deceased or not in other words it should take in all persons who can maintain an action under the legal representatives suits act or under section of the fatal accidents act as the case may be as well as those who can maintain an action under section a of the fatal accidents act that the term legal representative as defined in the code of civil procedure is not limited to administrators executors and heirs but includes any person who in law represents the estate of the deceased < org > points out that as per section of the present code of civil procedure a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person must include different legatees under the will and that there is no justification for holding that the estate in the context must mean the whole of the estate even so as i already pointed out a legal representative as contemplated under section of the code of the civil procedure should necessarily represent the estate of the deceased a person who is a dependant under section a of the fatal accidents act need not necessarily be one who represents the estate of the deceased first of all section a of the act gives power to < org > to make rules only for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of sections to the attempted definition under rule is not necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of sections to of the act further as i already pointed out if the term legal representative occurring in section a is to have the same meaning as in section of the code of civil procedure then the rights of some of the dependents under section a of the fatal accidents act who may not be persons representing the estate of the deceased would be affected and they would be out of court this contention if i may say so with respect was rightly rejected by the bench of < org > as i already pointed out under section of the code of civil procedure unless a person represents the estate of the deceased he cannot be called a legal representative and some of the dependants under section a of the fatal accidents act need not necessarily be persons who represent the estate of the deceased with respect i agree with the above observation one of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants is that as section of the act speaks of the < org > making an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just the powers of the < org > are independent of the provisions of the fatal accidents act as well as that under the legal representatives suits act and that therefore the
109	provisions of the act must be construed as substantive provisions and not merely procedural in character if it is a claim by an injured person he can certainly claim compensation for the pain suffering etc loss of earning other pecuniary loss arising out of the injury and shortening of expectation of life if any provided the injury or injuries had been caused by a tortious act by the owner of the vehicle by himself or vicariously so even though the claims < org > is given power to determine the amount of compensation which appears to be just it has necessarily to look to the law of torts in determining such just compensation similarly in case of death due to injuries just compensation awardable by the < org > should naturally be only towards loss of benefit if any and loss of estate if any provided again that the death was caused by a tortious act i think i have said enough to show that sections to of the act are only procedural in character and for substantive rights and liabilities of the parties one has necessarily to look to the law of torts read with the legal representatives suits act and the fatal accidents act in the recent amendment i under amending act lvi of some new sections have been added one of which section cc gives power to < org > to award simple interest on the amount awarded from the date of the claim application it cannot be said that that creates any new right and thereby the provisions in the act become substantive law and not merely procedural in character for even the civil < org > is not incompetent to award such interest now i turn to the case law on the point whether sections to are only procedural in character or not the division bench observed at page as we pointed out section provides a speeder remedy obviously conceived as a better one from the point of view of the injured person or his unfortunate dependants no new right or even a new remedy has beer created by that provisions the forum alone is changed the right to claim damages by the legal representatives of a deceased in respect of an accident where the latter met with his death was actionable under the pre existing law in civil < org > the aggrieved person has as before a remedy for damages in respect of the injury the period of limitation has also been curtailed but these two are matters of procedure then at page the division bench held that as the above provisions in the act relate only to procedure the law prevailing at the time of the institution of the action alone will govern such matters the conclusion was that even in respect of accidents which occurred prior to the constitution of the < org > only the < org > will
110	have exclusive jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the civil < org > is ousted with respect i agree with the view expressed by the above bench which was referred to earlier in some other connection < org > has followed the above decision of this court and held that sections to of the act only provide a more expeditious remedy and that they do not create any new rights < org > has taken the same view a similar view has been taken and it has been held that sections to merely deal with the subject of the substitution of < org > in place of civil courts for the purpose of adjudicating on claims for compensation and they do not deal with the question of substantive rights and liabilities of parties court has also taken a similar view in two cases viz < org > has also taken a similar view the sister of a deceased person is no doubt not a dependant as contemplated under section a of the fatal accidents act but still if she represented the estate of the deceased she could certainly maintain an action for claim on the ground of loss to the estate of the deceased therefore there is nothing wrong in awarding compensation to her towards the death of her brother the only point was whether the claim could be advanced by the married sister of the deceased who died as bachelor this conclusion does not go counter to the view expressed by us and in < name > < org > a < name > but the learned judges < name > < name > and < name > < name > in the course of their order dismissing the letters patent appeal in limine have observed that sections to have no connection whatsoever with the indian fatal accidents act and that they constitute a self contained code for the adjudication of claims to compensation on behalf of the victims of a motor accident and the < org > provided a complete machinery for the adjudication of such claims as i said even < name > < name > and < name > < name > have not specifically dealt with the question whether the abovesaid sections of the act are only procedural in character or they constitute substantive law anyway the decision of < name > < name > and < name > cannot be treated as a precedent in view of the fact that the judgment was not rendered after full arguments and it was only a dismissal of the letters patent appeal even at the admission stage that an argument addressed at motion hearing is rarely full and that a decision given at such a hearing must be held to be one given by the learned judge per incuriam and that such a decision by a court per incuriam is not binding as a precedent it has been held that decisions
111	rendered without hearing both the sides are not entitled to great weight are all judgments of the delhi < org > expressing the contrary view in these decisions the view expressed by < name > and < name > in < org > < org > a and the other cases which take a similar view have not been considered a division bench of this court referred to the decision of < name > the claimant in the case before < org > is the mother of the victim who would be entitled to claim loss of benefit under section a of the fatal accidents act as well as loss to the estate of the deceased as a person representing his estate the learned judges said in respect of the determination of the quantum that the decisions rendered under the general law of tort and under the fatal accidents act will undoubtedly be relevant and constitute broad guidelines but they would not be binding on the < org > in the sense that the method of approach should be the same and identical as in the cases arising under the fatal accidents act the only other decision which has to be referred to in this connection is < name > < name > a the sister as a person representing the estate of her deceased brother would certainly be entitled to claim compensation for loss to the estate of the deceased in allowing the appeal the learned judge has observed that the motor vehicles act is a special enactment and that it excludes the general enactment viz if the claim is towards loss of benefit it should necessarily be under the fatal accidents act and without invoking the provisions therein there is no scope for awarding compensation for loss of benefit the resulting position form the above discussion is that in respect of applications under section a of the act for the death of a person in a motor accident the claimants must prove that the accident amounted to a tortious act and if that is proved compensation can be awarded for loss of benefit to the claimants if they are dependents as contemplated under the provisions of the fatal accidents act and compensation can also be awarded towards loss to the estate of the deceased whether the claimants are dependants under the fatal accidents act or not however i may mention that it is settled law that while fixing the quantum of compensation towards loss of benefit any pecuniary advantage received by the claimants upon the death of the deceased should also be taken into consideration and compensation awarded towards loss to the estate of the deceased would also be such pecuniary advantage which should be taken into consideration in assessing the quantum towards loss of benefit if there is pecuniary advantage to the claimants that should go in reduction of the quantum of compensation awarded towards loss of benefit
112	any one who represents the estate of the deceased would be entitled to claim compensation towards loss to the estate such person who represents the estate need not necesarily be the heir of the deceased if a person who is injured lives for sometime but later succumbs to the injuries sustained in the accident a person who represents the estate of the deceased can claim damages for the pain and suffering of the deceased as well as loss of earnings and other damages actually suffered by the victim between the date of the accident and the date of death therefore there was no pain and suffering to the deceased or any loss of earning from the time of accident till the time of death there is also nothing to show that the deceased suffered any other damages due to the accident it was found as a matter of fact by the trial judge that in spite of old age the injured had been in good health and good condition and in the ordinary course of events could expect to have lived for at least a further or years there was a compendious award of towards pain and suffering physical disabilities and loss of expectation of life is referred to by < org > and they held that the principle laid down in that case viz that damages can be claimed for loss of expectation of life is not confined to the case where the injured person is alive at the date of the action and therefore the said damages can be claimed by the representative of the estate of the deceased as part of loss to the estate as a cause of action which entitled the injured to sue for loss of expectation of life survived to the person representing the estate of the injured who died under the law reform miscellaneous provisions act it is pointed out that damages given for shortening of life loss of expectation of life should not be calculated solely or even mainly on the basis of the length of life that is lost but they should be fixed at a reasonable figure for the loss of a measure of prospective happiness it is also pointed out that if the character or habits of the deceased are calculated to head him to a future of unhappiness or despondency that would be a circumstance justifying a smaller award the question thus resolves itself into that of fixing a reasonable figure to be paid by way of damages for the loss of a measure of prospective happiness such a problem might seem more suitable for discussion in an essay on aristotelian ethics than in the judgment of a < org > of law but in view of the earlier authorities we must do our best to contribute to its solution i would rather say that before damages are awarded in respect of the shortened life of a given individual under
113	this head it is necessary for the < org > to be satisfied that the circumstances of the individual life were calculated to lead on balance to a positive measure of happiness of which the victim has been deprived by the defendant negligence if the character or habits of the individual were calculated to lead him to a future of unhappiness or despondency that would be a circumstance justifying a smaller award it is significant that at any rate in one case we were informed the jury refused to award any damages under this head at all special cases suggest themselves where the termination of a life of constant pain and suffering cannot be regarded as inflicting injury or at any rate as inflicting the same injury as in more normal cases i would further lay it down that in assessing damages for this purpose the question is not whether the deceased had the capacity or ability to appreciate that his further life on earth would bring him happiness the test is not subjective and the right sum to award depends on an objective estimate of what kind of future on earth the victim might have enjoyed whether he had justly estimated that future or not of course no regard must be had to financial losses or gains during the period of which the victim has been deprived the claim was towards loss of expectation of life claimed by the mother of a victim who was aged years and months on the date of accident is a case where the wife of a person who was killed in an accident claimed damages for loss of expectation of life if there are materials to show that the victim would not have led a happy life if he had not been killed in the accident the assessment of compensation for loss of expectation of life has to be lower than in normal cases < org > held in one case that the estate could recover for the loss of future happiness of the victim but viscount < name > was soon to persuade his fellow law lords that this claim should be strictly contained the result is that no more than or so is recoverable by the estate for this the estate cannot claim for loss of earnings in the period during which the victim would otherwise have lived there is no claim for future loss of amenities or limbs and the like i would quote the relevant passage in assessing damages under this head regard must be had to the injured party normal expectation of life and not to his expectation of life in his injured condition or to the fact that his injuries are such that he does not want his life to be prolonged or does not know it has been shortened loss of the wages he would have earned during the years by which his life has been reduced are
114	to be disregarded there was no prospect of his earning anything more in the years to come and there was no question of his saving anything out of it considering these facts < name > held that the deceased could have expect to be looked after well and maintained comfortably by his sons and that therefore by his death there was loss of prospective happiness to the deceased that the assessment of the same at rs this sum was arrived at by taking into consideration inter alia the reasonable provision the deceased if alive would have made for them that figure represents the damages for the mental agony suffering and loss of expectation of life there was no duplication in awarding damages under both the heads their lordships of < org > stress the fact that the right of action in respect of compensation for loss of benefit and that towards loss to the estate are quite distinct and independent and that there was nothing wrong in awarding compensation under both the heads even though the claimants may be the same however there can be no dispute that any sum paid to a dependant of the deceased who is entitled to compensation towards loss of benefit as compensation for loss to the estate would be a pecuniary advantage to him but for the death of the deceased there would be no occasion for the said dependant to receive compenation towards loss to the estate as a person representing the estate of the deceased their lordships of < org > do recognise this for they quote with approval rose ford a cases of the courts in england which make it clear that when the claimant under both the heads is the same the sum awarded towards loss to the estate should go in reduction of compensation for loss of benefit had been awarded under the other head but there is nothing to show that in that case < org > in fixing the quantum of compensation towards loss of benefit had not taken into consideration the award under the other head only under such circumstances it has been held that there was no ground to reduce the sum of rs awarded towards loss of benefit on the alleged ground that there was duplication in awarding damages referred to by us earlier and some other decisions of the courts in england have been referred to by their lordships of < org > with approval though for the other aspect viz that the two heads of claim are independent of each other but when the claimant is the same the amount awarded towards loss to the estate should go in reduction of compensation for loss of benefit nowhere in the judgment of < org > there is any observation that the expected future earnings of the deceased or the savings there form is part of loss of expectation of life or any other item of
115	loss to the estate so on the head of loss to the estate of the deceased the only ground on which compensation can be awarded in this case is loss of expectation of life viz if the deceased had not been killed but only crippled and thereby there was shortening of his life he himself would have been entitled to claim compensation for loss of expectation of life accordingly the appeal is allowed to the extent that there will be an award in favour of the appellants claimants before the < org > below for rupees five thousand which sum is payable by the nd respondent the insurance company within a month from this date kailasam the facts of the case have been fully set out by nay learned brother and need not be reiterated the questions that arise in this civil miscellaneous appeal are whether the accident was due to the negligence on the part of the driver of the lorry and whether the claimants who are the brothers and sisters of the person who was killed in the accident are persons entitled to compensation under section a of the motor vehicles act i have no hesitation in concurring with the finding of my learned brother that the driver of the lorry was guilty of negligence regarding the question whether the brothers and the sisters of the deceased are entitled to claim compensation there could be no difficulty in holding that they are entitled to compensation towards loss of estate of the deceased but not as claimants under section a of the indian fatal accidents act viii of it has been held by this court in palani ammal the safe service limited a the case law on this subject has been fully discussed by my learned brother and i agree with the preponderance of judicial opinion and the conclusion arrived at by my learned brother that the provisions in sections a to of the motor vehicles act are only procedural and do not purport to confer any substantial right or liability on the parties i agree with the conclusion of my learned brother that all persons who are entitled to make an application for compensation under section a of the motor vehicles act will be legal representatives of the deceased within the meaning of the said section but i am unable to associate myself with the view that the definition of the term legal representative in section of the code of civil procedure would not include all persons who are entitled to apply for compensation under section a of the motor vehicles act and that rule of the madras motor accidents claims tribunals rules which provides that the term legal representative shall have the meaning assigned to it under clause of section of on our conclusion that all claimants under section a of the motor vehicles act are legal representatives of the deceased and are entitled to compensation
116	as provided for under section strictly the question as to whether in view of the scope of the definition of the term legal representative in section of the code of civil procedure rule of the motor accidents claims tribunals rules is ultra vires or not does not arise in this case but as the question had been discussed at some length by my learned brother i would indicate my opinion briefly in indian law while in earlier cases a strict meaning was given to the expression legal representative subsequently the term was construed to cover all persons representing the estate of the deceased person under the old code a strict meaning was given to the term legal representative as in the english law < name > in repelling the contention that the term should be construed strictly and cannot include anybody except the heir executor or administrator of the deceased as the term and the definition were taken from english law and that when the < org > used the term legal representative in the section and not the word representative it must have intended to use it in the strict sense observed that the section appears to have been drawn for the protection of the decree holders and to give them a right to relief against the successor in property or estate of the deceased judgment debtor the learned judge held that the term legal representative appears to have been used as one which would cover ordinary cases of succession the definition has also been extended to the case of a person who without title as administrator executor heir revensioner or surviving coparcener is the de facto possessor of the estate of the deceased hindu it having been held that he must be treated for some purposes as his representative and that a judgment obtained against such a representative is not a mere nullity after an elaborate review of the authorities the learned judge summed up the position thus from this review of the authorities it will appear that judicial decisions have extended the sense of the term legal representative beyond that of its ordinary meaning of administrator executor and heir and though such extension has been attended with doubt and has in some cases been the subject of conflicting decisions it appears to me to be too late now to endeavour however convenient it might be to secure for the term that which is perhaps its strict and legitimate sense i agree therefore in holding that the term is not limited to administrators executors and heirs and am of opinion that it must now be held to include any person who in law represents the estate of a deceased judgment debtor the definition of the term legal representative in section of the code of civil procedure is too wide and the < org > has in fact given effect to the views expressed in < name > < name >
117	and introduced the present definition of the term legal representative in section of the code of civil procedure which reads as follows legal representative means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddless with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued according to the present definition the term legal representative is very wide in its amplitude and covers all persons who in law represent the estate of the deceased person are all omitted and what is now required is that the person must in law represent the estate of the deceased person the court held that the whole object of widening the scope of the expression legal representative which the present definition is intended to achieve would be frustrated if it is held that legatees of different portions of the estate of a deceased do not fall within its purview thus it is settled law that any person who becomes entitled to a part of the estate can be held to represent the estate and thereby a legal representative of the deceased the point that arises is whether a person who claims compensation on the death of a person is a person who in law represents the estate of the deceased person section a of the fatal accidents act provides that a suit for compensation to the family of a person for loss occasioned to it by his death by actionable wrong is maintainable the section provides that such a suit shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent or child if any of the person whose death has been caused and it shall be brought by and in the name of the executor administrator or representative of the person deceased in such an action the < org > will award damages in proportion to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought the amount shall be divided amongst the parties mentioned in such shares as the < org > by its judgment or decree shall direct section provides that not more than one action or suit shall be brought in respect of the same subject matter of complaint and that in any such suit or action the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased the learned judges in summing up the provisions of sections a and of the act observed as follows in cases where the deceased is represented by an executor or an administrator such an executor or administrator is
118	given the power to sue for the compensation for the benefit of the specified relations where there is no executor or administrator or where there is one and he fails or is unwilling to sue then in our opinion the suit may be instituted by and in the name of the representative of the person but one suit only is allowed to enforce the claims of all the persons beneficially entitled it being provided that the rights of each and every one of them shall be adjudged and adjusted by the < org > in such suit the right of each beneficiary is only to receive compensation in proportion to the loss occasioned to him by the death of his deceased relative regarding the term representative of the deceased the court held that there was no reason for limiting the meaning of the word in a narrow way and found that the word meant and included all or any one of the persons for whose benefit a suit under the act can be maintained and that these persons are the representatives of the deceased in the sense that they are the persons taking the place of the deceased in obtaining reparation for the wrong done this decision is an authority for the proposition that the word representative of the deceased in act xiii of would include any person who takes the place of the deceased for obtaining reparation for the wrong done to be a legal representative under section of the code of civil procedure a person in law must represent the estate of the deceased person when a person is taking the place of the deceased as his representative it would follow that he represents also the estate of the deceased especially when the procedure contemplated under the act enabled the executor administrator or representative of the deceased to file a suit on behalf of the dependants and others with equal force will apply to the term legal representative and the persons taking the place of the deceased for obtaining reparation for the wrong done will not only be representatives for the purpose of the act xiii of but also under section of the code of civil procedure it would be too narrow a construction that though the persons taking the place of the deceased are representatives of the deceased they are not the representatives of the deceased estate is that the term representative would apply to any person taking the place of the deceased in a suit under act xiii of which would include a claim for the benefit to the estate also it follows therefore that the definition of the term legal representative in the context is wide enough to cover all persons who can maintain a claim for compensation taking the place of the deceased person as in this case the question does not arise as the deceased who was a labourer would not have accumulated any earnings for future during his life time the petitioners would not be entitled to
119	any increase in the compensation awarded to them on the ground of likely loss of future earnings or savings therefrom occasioned to the estate of the deceased [SEP]

121	discharge made upon an application for discharge upon a writ of habeas corpus but it is impossible to contend that the mere fact of a general word being used in a statute precludes all enquiry into the object of the statute or the mischief which it was intended to remedy mr justice < name > held that < org > could issue the habeas carpus outside the orginal jurisdiction to the superintendent of the jail at ali pore in the code of criminal procedure act of was enacted which gave the right to european british subjects detained in custody whether within the limits of < org > original jurisdiction or outside those limits to apply for an order directing the person detaining him to bring him before < org > in other words for an order under section in the nature of habeas corpus section provided that neither < org > s nor any judge of such < org > shall issue any writ of habeas corpus mainprise de homine replegiando nor any other writ of the like nature beyond the presidency towns this prohibition cannot in my opinion be confined to the case of european british subjects nor has this been contended before us in < org > s criminal procedure act of in section set out various purposes for which an order in the nature a habeas corpus might be made and it gave power to < org > s to make such orders in the case of persons within the limits of their original jurisdiction certain particular matters were excepted it being stated that nothing in this section applies to a person detained under bengal regulation iii of and certain other regulations but it is quite clear that for the purposes provided for by section the intention was that relief should be granted under the section arid recourse should not be had to the old prerogative writs the subsequent history of the matter is shortly this that when the code of criminal procedure was amended in the acts of and were comprised in schedule i as enactments repealed by section but not so as to restore any jurisdiction or form of procedure not existing or followed on the st january act of the matter remained very much in the same position until when a right was given to everybody within the appellate jurisdiction of this court to make an application under section of the present criminal procedure code the question which arises is whether for any of the purposes mentioned in what is now section it is open to an applicant still to say that he will make his application independently of that section altogether for the prerogative writ of habeas corpus on the civil side of < org > i observe that it has been stated in certain cases that if there
122	is to be any question of the abolition of this right then the < org > must say so in the most specific terms < org > has used the most specific terms and it is plain that the indian < org > never intended that the < org > in giving relief of this character should for any of the purposes mentioned in section be at liberty to act under it or under the old procedure this judgment was approved by the board and it was held that in cases covered by a the power to issue a common law writ of habeas corpus in british india had been taken away by legislation and the powers conferred by section substituted therefor under section of the criminal procedure code no appeal lies from any judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided for by the code or by any other law for the time being in force there is no provision in the code for an appeal from an order made under section there is no conviction or acquittal in such proceedings and section which taken along with the new section a enacted by section of the amending act of act xxvi of allows an appeal on behalf of the < org > only from an order of acquittal is equally inapplicable turning again to section of the government of india act of their lordships are clearly of opinion that the section relates to both the civil and criminal jurisdiction of < org > the terms of sub section of section appear to put this beyond doubt and their lordships agree with the decision of < org > to this effect in < name > the crown the purpose of the provision is to confer a right of appeal in every case that involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the act or any order in council made thereunder their lordships are therefore of opinion that the appeals from < org > were competent and it follows that the appeal to his majesty in council was also competent and they will proceed to deal with the appeal on the merits the present applications under section of the criminal procedure code were filed on april two days after the decision of < org > in < name > king emperor bom under which it was held reversing the decision of < org > refusing to make an order under section for release of the applicants that rule of the defence of india rules was ultra vires and was not warranted by the defence of india act by section of the ordinance a new clause was substituted for clause of section of the defence of india act section of the ordinance provided that no order heretofore made against any person under rule of the defence of india rules shall be deemed to be
123	invalid or shall be called in question on the ground merely that the said rule purported to confer powers in excess of the powers that might at the time the said rule was made be lawfully conferred by a rule made or deemed to have been made under section of the defence of india act the amendment effected by section of the ordinance removed the grounds on which < org > had pronounced rule to be ultra vires act xxxv of as amended by section of the defence of india amendment act act xix of are as follows i the central government may by notification in the official < org > make such rules as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for securing the defence of british india the public safety the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by subjection i the rules may provide for or may empower any authority to make orders providing for all or any of the following matters namely preventing the spreading without lawful authority or excuse of false reports or the prosecution of any purpose likely to cause disaffection or alarm or to prejudice his majesty relations with foreign powers or with states in india or to prejudice the maintenance of peaceful conditions in the tribal areas or to promote feelings of enmity and hatred between different classes of his majesty subjects the apprehension and detention in custody of any person reasonably suspected of being of hostile origin or of having acted acting or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or interest or to the defence of british india the prohibition of such person from entering or residing or remaining in any area and the compelling of such person to reside and remain in any area or to do or abstain from doing anything the central government or < org > if it is satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of british india the public safety the maintenance of a public order his majesty relations with foreign powers or indian states the maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas or the efficient prosecution of the war it is necessary so to do may make an order a directing that he be detained we therefore reject the main argument addressed to us on behalf of the appellant and if there were nothing more in the appeal we should dismiss it without further discussion there is however another aspect of the case which was not argued until the < org > itself drew the attention of counsel to it for it seemed to us that it was open to question
124	whether rule itself in its present form was within the rule making powers conferred by the defence of india act the learned judge then proceeded to discuss paragraphs and of section of the act and for reasons fully stated by him he came to the conclusion that rule was not within the powers conferred by sub section of section and he stated the < org > having set out in plain and unambiguous language in paragraph the scope of the rules which may be made providing for apprehension and detention in custody it is not permissible to pray in aid the more general words in section in order to justify a rule which so plainly goes beyond the limits of paragraph though if paragraph were not in the act at all perhaps different considerations might apply we are compelled therefore to hold that rule in its present form goes beyond the rule making powers which the < org > has thought fit to confer upon < org > and is for that reason invalid in the opinion of their lordships the function of sub section is merely an illustrative one the rule making power is conferred by sub section and the rules which are referred to in the opening sentence of sub section are the rules which are authorised by and made under sub section the provisions of sub section are not restrictive of sub section as indeed is expressly stated by the words without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section their lordships are therefore of opinion that < name > case was wrongly decided by < org > and that rule was made in conformity with the powers conferred by sub section of section of the defence of india act it is accordingly unnecessary for their lordships to consider whether rule was not also within paragraphs and of sub section of section contrary to the opinion of < org > and their lordships express no opinion on the matter as regards the remaining questions counsel for the < org > stated them under two main heads viz first whether the orders of detention can be questioned in view of the provisions of section of the government of india act and section of the defence of india act and secondly assuming that they can be so questioned whether there were materials on which the < org > below could properly decide that the orders were not made in conformity with rule whereas the person known as < name > a son of late < name > of kali banerjee lane howrah is detained in the howrah jail under the provision in rule of the defence of india rules and whereas the governor is satisfied that with a view to preventing the said person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of british india the public safety the maintenance of public order
125	or the efficient prosecution of the war it is necessary to make the following orders to continue his detention now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by clause of sub rule and sub rule of rule of the defence of india rules the governor is pleased to direct a that the said person shall until further orders be detained that until further orders the said person shall continue to be detained in the howrah jail and that during such detention the said person shall be subject to the conditions laid down in the bengal security prisoners rules of bengal there is no material difference from the above order in the case of the remaining orders a provincial government as respects anything done or to be done by the provincial government after the commencement of part iii of the government of india act shall mean a in a governor province the governor acting or not acting in his discretion and exercising or not exercising his individual judgment according to the provision in that behalf made by and under the said act section of the government of india act on which the < org > relies provides orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the governor and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the governor in the opinion of their lordships the contention of the < org > goes too far as the sub section only relates to one specified ground of challenge namely that the order or instrument was not made or executed by the governor question the accuracy of a recital contained in a duly authenticated order particularly where that recital purports to state as a fact the carrying out of what i regard as a condition necessary to the valid making of that order the presence of the recital in the order will place a difficult burden on the detenue to produce admissible evidence sufficient to establish even a prima facie case that the recital is not accurate no order made in exercise of any power conferred by or under this act shall be called in question in any court where an order purports to have been made and signed by any authority in exercise of any power conferred by or under this act a court shall within the meaning of the indian evidence act presume that such order was so made by that authority sub section assumes that the order is made in exercise of the power which clearly leaves it open to challenge on the ground that it was not made in conformity with the power conferred heavily though the burden of proof may lie on the challenger as stated
126	by the chief justice in the passage just cited sub section raises a presumption of fact which may be displaced though here again the burden is likely to be heavy section of the indian evidence act provides whenever it is directed by this act that the court shall presume a fact it shall regard such fact as proved unless and until it is disproved accordingly the contention of the < org > that the < org > has no jurisdiction to investigate the validity of the orders fails they based their conclusion mainly on the power of delegation which has admittedly not been exercised in the present case conferred by sub section of section of the defence of india act which provides as follows a provincial government may by order direct that any power or duty which by rule made under sub section i is conferred or imposed on the provincial government or which being by such rule conferred or imposed on < org > has been directed under sub section to be exercised or discharged by the provincial government shall in such circumstances and under such conditions if any as may be specified in the direction be exercised or discharged by any officer or authority not being except in the case of a chief commissioner province an officer or authority subordinate to < org > i the executive authority of a province shall be exercised on behalf of his majesty by the governor either directly or through officers subordinate to him but nothing in this section shall prevent the < org > or < org > from conferring functions upon subordinate authorities or be deemed to transfer to the governor any functions conferred by any existing indian law or any court judge or officer or any local or other authority subject to the provisions of this act the executive authority of each province extends to the matters with respect to which < org > has power to make laws there shall be a council of ministers to aid and advise the governor in the exercise of his functions except in so far as he is by or under this act required to exercise his functions or any of them in hi discretion provided that nothing in this sub section shall be construed as preventing the governor from exercising his individual judgment in any case where by or under this act he is required so to do if any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the governor is by or under this act required to act in his discretion or to exercise his individual judgment the decision of the governor in his discretion shall be final and the validity of anything done by the governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion or ought or ought not to have exercised his individual judgment the governor shall make rules for
127	the more convenient transaction of the business of < org > and for the allocation among ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the governor is by or under this act required to act in his discretion the rules shall include provisions requiring ministers and secretaries to government to transmit to the governor all such information with respect to the business of < org > as may be specified in the rules or as the governor may otherwise require to be so transmitted and in particular requiring a minister to bring to the notice of the governor and the appropriate secretary to bring to the notice of the minister concerned and of the governor any matter under consideration by him which involves or appears to him likely to involve any special responsibility of the governor rules of business have been framed by the governor of bengal under section under which it is not disputed that questions of detention fall to be transacted in < org > under rule all orders or instruments made or executed by or on behalf of < org > are to be expressed to be made by or by order of the governor of bengal and under rule save in cases of special authorisation every order or instrument of < org > is to be signed by either a secretary an additional secretary a joint secretary a deputy secretary an under secretary or an assistant secretary to < org > and such signatures are to be deemed to be the proper authentication of such orders or instruments in the first place their lordships observe that the provisions of chapter ii of part iii of the act of as to < org > and its executive authority use the term executive in the broader sense as including both a decision as to action and the carrying out of such decision counsel for the respondents submitted a contention which the majority of the learned judges in < org > had accepted based on sub section of section of the act of to the effect that the sub section limited the operation of the section to matters with respect to which < org > has power to make laws and that the subject matter of < org > was not within those powers the learned judges in confirmation of this view referred to sub section of section which provides that an act of the federal legislature may notwithstanding that it relates to a matter with respect to which < org > has no power to make laws confer powers and impose duties or authorise the conferring of powers and the imposition of duties upon a province or officers and authorities thereof their lordships are unable to agree with such a narrow reading of these provisions which would involve the necessity of < org > making provision in each case
128	for the executive machinery to carry out the powers and duties so imposed instead of using the existing provincial machinery this view is supported by sub section of section which provides inter alia that where an act of < org > by virtue of sub section confers powers and imposes duties upon a province or officers and authorities thereof in relation to a matter with respect to which < org > has no power to make laws the < org > is to pay to the province such sum as is agreed or determined by arbitration in respect of any extra costs of administration incurred by the province in connection with exercise of those powers and duties their lordships would also add on this contention that sub section of section provides a means of delegation in the strict sense of the word namely a transfer of the power or duty to the officer or authority defined in the sub section with a corresponding divestiture of the governor of any responsibility in the matter whereas under section of the act of the governor remains responsible for the action of his subordinates taken in his name their lordships are therefore in agreement with the learned chief justice of < org > that such matters as those which fell to be dealt with by the governor under rule could be dealt with by him in the normal manner in which the executive business of < org > was carried on under the provisions of chapter ii of part iii of the act of and in particular under the provisions of section and the rules of business made under section in view of the opinions already expressed by their lordships the orders for detention in each of these cases must be taken as ex facie regular and proper and it follows as already stated that there is a heavy burden on the respondents to displace the presumption enacted by section of the defence of india act the respondents were enabled to raise the question as to whether the governor was bound to give his personal consideration to the matter by reason of the < org > admission that he had not in fact done so in any of these cases the majority of < org > held all the detention orders to be bad because of the first of these admissions though they also deal with the routine order and criticise adversely the whole procedure the evidence before < org > consisted of affidavits by the respondents the counter affidavit by mr < name > additional home secretary to < org > and certain statements and answers regarding detention under rule given by the home minister bengal in < org > further there is nothing in the affidavits filed by the respondents which establishes such a prima facie case and they were not so founded on at the hearing before the < org >
129	the respondents case was founded on the statements and answers by the home minister as to which their lordships have expressed their view above and mr < name > counter affidavit which their lordships will now consider defence of india rules together with a recommendation by the < org > for detention under rule in respect of persons arrested in connection with the disturbances or suspected of being so connected orders of detention under rule i should at once be issued as a matter of course subject to review by < org > on receipt of further details to be supplied in each case by < org > on th october i considered the materials before me and in accordance with the general order of government directed the issue of an order of detention under rule of the defence of india rules police to see if there was material sufficient to justify the issue of an order under the routine order that would not be in accordance with the requirement of the routine order that the police having recommended it the order of detention should be issued as a matter of course their lordships agree with the unanimous conclusion of < org > that the orders of detention in the cases of the present respondents nos and are invalid there remain the cases of respondents nos and the orders of detention in these cases were earlier in date than the routine order of october and are not affected thereby as their lordships have already stated there is no evidence in these cases sufficient to rebut the presumption as to their regularity there is only one point on which their lordships desire to add an observation in paragraphs and of his affidavit mr < name > states that in the cases of < name > present respondent no < name > present respondent no and < name > present respondent no he himself considered the materials supplied and in fact the orders of detention were signed by him accordingly their lordships agree with the chief justice of < org > that the orders of detention in the cases of respondents nos and were valid and the appeal of the < org > will be allowed in the case of these four respondents counsel for the < org > stated to their lordships that without prejudice to any further action under rule that the < org > may find it expedient or necessary to take it was not intended that any further action should be taken against these four respondents under the particular orders which are before the < org > in this appeal their lordships will therefore humbly advise his majesty that the appeal should be allowed as respects respondents nos and and the judgments and orders of the < org > below should be set aside and that it should be declared that the order
130	of detention under rule of the defence of india rules in each of these cases was a valid and proper order that in the case of respondents nos and the appeal should be dismissed and the judgments and orders of the < org > below should be affirmed [SEP]
131	[CLS] these two appeals are filed against the common order passed in writ petitions nos and of by < name > dismissing the petitions the appellant hereinafter referred to as the assessee was the petitioner in the said petitions and the ito company circle iii bangalore was the respondent in the writ petitions the assessee prayed for the issue of an appropriate writ order or direction quashing the two notices dated march issued by the respondent under of the i act hereinafter referred to as the act proposing to reassess the income of the assessee for the assessment years and on the ground that he had reason to believe that certain income of the assessee had escaped assessment in each of the above assessment years and for a writ in the nature of prohibition restraining the respondent from taking any steps pursuant to the said notices the sale of these products is being effected by the assessee through its selling agents < org > which is a firm carrying on business at madras with whom the assessee has entered into an agreement the assessee has been making payments to the said firm for the services rendered in connection with the sale of its products the question whether the said payments could be treated as revenue expenditure and if so to what extent arose for consideration before the income tax authorities in the earlier assessment years i and having regard to a a of the act and the relationship that existed between the directors of the assessee company and the partners of the firm of < org > after perusing the tripartite agreement dated december entered into between the assessee the selling agents and < org > and on the basis of the material available on record the < org > concluded that the selling agents < org > had been rendering various services and providing various facilities to the assessee such as i giving guidelines to the assessee in the matter of manufacture of various models and range of pressure cookers in the light of their own market research ii giving advice to the assessee in the matter of selection and appointment of distributors for the sale of cookers and fixing the terms and conditions thereof and also advising termination of services of distributors as and when required iii making reports to the assessee on the activities of the competitors iv participation in the finalisation of advertisement and sales promotional campaigns supervising the activities of the distributors vi attending to complaints of consumers vii helping the assessee in the matter of collection from distributors viii helping the assessee in liaison work with government authorities ix helping the assessee in procuring
132	raw materials and helping the assessee in the matter of excise duty etc the < org > also perused the resolution dated october passed by the assessee company in its extraordinary general meeting appointing < org > as sole selling agents on a commission of on cookers and on spare parts and considered that with the passage of time as and when the assessee came to undertake the after sale service the quantum of commission had to be reduced gradually to and respectively the departmental stand that there was no specific agreement entered into by the assessee with < org > was rejected by the < org > which held that the various resolutions passed by the assessee company and the tripartite agreement earlier referred to constituted the agreement when the assessment of the income of the assessee arose during the assessment year the < org > disallowed by his order dated august the claim made by the assessee regarding payments made to the selling agents as the decision of the < org > had not yet been rendered on the appeals referred to above the assessee filed an appeal against the said order of assessment before the < org > in the assessment order dated january passed in respect of the assessment year the ito himself granted the allowance claimed in respect of payments made to the selling agents as by then the appellate orders of the < org > in respect of the earlier years had been pronounced it would appear that the internal audit party raised an objection regarding allowance having been made in respect of payments made to the selling agents under a a of the act as according to them the case had to be dealt with under i of the act in view of the observations made by the audit party the < org > decided to issue the impugned notices under of the act proposing to reopen the assessments for the assessment years and and to make a reassessment aggrieved by the said notices the assessee filed the two writ petitions the petitions were dismissed at the stage of preliminary hearing by the learned single judge observing that since it was open to the assessee to appear before the < org > and to urge that there was no case for reopening the assessment proceedings already completed they were not fit cases for interference at this stage these appeals are filed against the orders of the learned single judge after the respondent was served with the notices in these appeals he has filed a statement of objections to the relief claimed by the assessee the income tax officer accordingly took action under section and initiated proceedings by issue of notice under section for both
133	the assessment years the appellant has challenged these notices in the writ appeals on various grounds the grounds on which the notices are challenged are i that it was not open to the department to reopen the assessments for the two years having accepted the < org > order on the same point for the assessment year ii the notices were issued only on a change of opinion iii that section of the act has no application to the assessee case and the only section which has application is section a iv neither section a nor is applicable to the assessee case it is submitted that none of the grounds referred to above is available to the assessee to urge in the writ appeals for the following reasons i that for the assessment year the order of the < org > is accepted by the department is not relevant for initiating action under section for the subsequent assessment years ii the notices are not issued only on account of mere change of opinion on the part of the income tax officer but were issued as a consequence of audit objections raised by the internal audit party iii whether the provisions of section a or of section are applicable to the facts of the case is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the income tax officer to adjudicate under the act and this is not a matter for interference by this hon ble court under art iv the notices are issued under section and the records of assessment contain the information in support of the action and the notices are validly issued notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sections to the following amounts shall not be deducted in computing the income chargeable under the head profits and gains of business or profession in the case of any company i any expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any remuneration or benefit or amenity to a director or to a person who has a substantial interest in the company or to a relative of the director or of such person as the case may be ii any expenditure or allowance in respect of any assets of the company used by any person referred to in sub clause i either wholly or partly for his own purposes or benefit if in the opinion of the income tax officer any such expenditure or allowance as is mentioned in sub clauses i and ii is excessive or unreasonable having regard to the legitimate business needs of the company and the benefit derived by or accruing to it therefrom so however that the deduction in respect of the aggregate of such expenditure and allowance in respect of any one person referred to in sub clause i shall in no case exceed a where such expenditure or allowance relates to a period exceeding eleven months comprised in the previous year the amount of seventy two thousand rupees where
134	such expenditure or allowance relates to a period not exceeding eleven months comprised in the previous year an amount calculated at the rate of six thousand rupees for each month or part thereof comprised in that period provided that in a case where such person is also an employee of the company for any period comprised in the previous year expenditure of the nature referred to in clauses i ii iii and iv of the second proviso to clause a of sub section of section a shall not be taken into account for the purposes of sub clause a or sub clause as the case may be the provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of this act relating to the computation of income under the head profits and gains of business or profession a where the assessee incurs any expenditure in respect of which payment has been or is to be made to any person referred to in clause of this sub section and the income tax officer is of opinion that such expenditure is excessive or unreasonable having regard to the fair market value of the goods services of facilities for which the payment is made or the legitimate needs of business or profession of the assessee or the benefit derived by or accruing to him therefrom so much of the expenditure as is so considered by him to be excessive or unreasonable shall not be allowed as a deduction provided that the provisions of this sub section shall not apply in the case of an assessee being a company in respect of any expenditure to which sub clause i of clause of section applies there is no dispute in this case that if i is applicable to the case then the challenge to the impugned notices has to fail there is also no dispute about the nature of services and facilities that were provided by the selling agents for which payments have been made the questions raised in these appeals have therefore to be decided on the above basis they are i whether it is open to this court under article of the constitution to quash the impugned notices and to issue an order restraining the income tax officer from taking further steps ii whether the observations made by the internal audit party amounts to information within the meaning of that expression in section of the act and iii whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the income tax officer had in consequence of such information reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for the assessment years in question the first question arises out of the contention urged on behalf of the department that the petitions are barred under art of the constitution which provides that no petition for the redress of any injury referred to in sub clause or sub clause of clause of art the prayers made in the writ
135	petitions are that the notices issued under of the act in contravention of law which are likely to result in injury of a substantial natural may be quashed and a writ in the nature of prohibition may be issued to the respondent restraining him from taking any further step pursuant to the impugned notices the question is whether the law provides any alternative machinery through which the assessee can secure the reliefs prayed for in the petitions it may be possible for a party to a proceeding before an inferior court or < org > to urge all his contentions against the jurisdiction assumed by it and challenge its decision on that question either before a higher court or tribunal to which an appeal or revision petition may lie against such decision or by applying for a writ in the nature of certiorari under art but there is one fundamental distinction between the two writs and that is what is material for the present purpose they are issued at different stages of the proceedings when an inferior court takes up for hearing a matter over which it has no jurisdiction the person against whom the proceedings are taken can move the superior court for a writ of prohibition and on that an order will issue forbidding the inferior court from continuing the proceedings on the other hand if the court hears that cause or matter and gives a decision the party aggrieved would have to move the superior court for a writ of certiorari and on that an order will be made quashing the decision on the ground of want of jurisdiction it might happen that in a proceeding before the inferior court a decision might have been passed which does not completely dispose of the matter in which case it might be necessary to apply both for certiorari and prohibition certiorari for quashing what had been decided and prohibition for arresting the further continuance of the proceeding authorities have gone to this extent that in such cases when an application is made for a writ of prohibition and there is no prayer for certiorari it would be open to the court to stop further proceedings which are consequential on the decision broadly speaking and apart from the cases of the kind referred to above a writ of prohibition will lie when the proceedings are to any extent pending and a writ of certiorari for quashing after they have terminated in a final decision it is well settled that the writ of prohibition lies not only for excess of jurisdiction or for absence of jurisdiction but the writ also lies in case of departure from the rules of natural justice see halsbury laws of england rd edn it was held for instance by < org > in king < name > kb that as the order of the judge of < org > of july was made without giving
136	the vicar an opportunity of being heard in his defence the order was made in violation of the principles of natural justice and was therefore an order made without jurisdiction and the writ of prohibition ought to issue but the writ does not lie to correct the course practice or procedure of an inferior tribunal or a wrong decision on the merits of the proceedings it is also well established that a writ of prohibition cannot be issued to a court or an inferior tribunal for an error of law unless the error makes it go outside its jurisdiction see < name > comptroller general of patents and designs wlr at qb and < org > < name > clr if there is want of jurisdiction then the matter is coram non judice and a writ of prohibition will lie to the court or inferior tribunal forbidding it to continue proceedings therein in excess of its jurisdiction the petitioner who questioned the jurisdiction of the authority to issue such a notice applied under art < org > of patna took the view that the bihar sales tax act undoubtedly conferred jurisdiction on the sto to investigate the question of liability of a dealer to sales tax and accordingly he was well within his jurisdiction in issuing the impugned notice and dismissed the petition observing that if on assessment it was found that the order was erroneous the matter could be agitated in appeal under that act it has been argued that the application was premature for there has so far been no investigation or finding on facts and no assessment under section of the act in the first place it ignores the plain fact that this notice calling upon the appellant company to forthwith get itself registered as a dealer and to submit a return and to deposit the tax in a treasury in bihar places upon it considerable hardship harassment and liability which if the act is void under article read with article constitute in praesenti an encroachment on and an infringement of its right which entitles it to immediately appeal to the appropriate court for redress it is therefore not reasonable to expect the person served with such an order or notice to ignore it on the ground that it is illegal for he can only do so at his own risk and peril this court has said in the last mentioned case that a person placed in such a situation has the right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly where he stands and what he may or may not do another plea advanced by the respondent < org > is that the appellant company is not entitled to take proceedings praying for the issue of prerogative writs under article as it has adequate alternative remedy under the impugned act by way of appeal or revision the remedy under the act
137	cannot be said to be adequate and is indeed nugatory or useless if the act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can therefore have no application where a party comes to court with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article we are therefore of the opinion for reasons stated above that < org > was not right in holding that the petition under article was misconceived or was not maintainable < name > mentioned more than once the fact that the company would have sufficient opportunity to raise this question viz whether the income tax officer had reason to believe that under assessment had resulted from non disclosure of material facts before the income tax officer himself in the assessment proceedings and if unsuccessful there before the appellate officer or < org > or in < org > under section of the india income tax act the existence of such alternative remedy is not however always a sufficient reason for refusing a party quick relief by a writ or order prohibiting an authority acting without jurisdiction from continuing such action of the constitution which restricts the scope of power of < org > under art was no bar to entertain petition in which the validity of a notice under of the act was challenged holding that there was no provision in the act providing for any remedy for the redress of any injury that might be caused to the assessee if the assessment was allowed to be reopened and that a suit in which the validity of such notice could be questioned could not be considered as an alternative remedy barring the jurisdiction of < org > under art of the constitution precluded an assessee from challenging a notice issued under of the act relying upon the observations made by < org > in the case of < org > and holding that < org > had recognised the existence of an alternative remedy we are of the view that the case has to be examined in the light of the amended art which imposes a restriction on the power of < org > and the nature of the alternative remedy available in that case < org > qualified the words alternative remedy with the word such as referring to the remedy by way of an appeal and reference under to < org > which were referred to by the counsel for the department we respectfully agree with the views expressed in the above decisions of the < org > of gujarat calcutta and orissa in so far as the question of issue of a writ in the nature of
138	prohibition is concerned and hold that the writ petitions out of which these appeals arise are not barred by art any appropriate order or direction restraining the continuance of an illegal proceeding if on merits the case requires < org > to do so hence we reject the first contention the third question relates to the jurisdiction of the < org > to issue the impugned notices on the facts and in the circumstances of the case it is argued by sri < name > learned counsel for the revenue that the question whether the information he had was sufficient to issue the impugned notices was a matter for the decision of the < org > and cannot be canvassed before this court in a petition under art in the case of < org > < org > rejected a similar contention while considering the validity of a notice issued under of the indian i act which correspond to ss and of the act in the following terms < name > argued that the question whether the income tax officer had reason to believe that under assessment had occurred by reason of non disclosure of material facts should not be investigated by the courts in an application under article learned counsel seems to suggest that as soon as the income tax officer has reason to believe that there has been under assessment in any year he has jurisdiction to start proceedings under section by issuing a notice provided years have not elapsed from the end of the year in question but whether the notices should have been issued within a period of years or not is only a question of limitation which could and should properly be raised in the assessment proceedings it is wholly incorrect however to suppose that this is a question of limitation only not touching the question of jurisdiction the scheme of the law clearly is that where the income tax officer has reason to believe that an under assessment has resulted from non disclosure he shall have jurisdiction to start proceedings for reassessment within a period of years and where he has reason to believe that an under assessment has resulted from other causes he shall have jurisdiction to start proceedings for reassessment within years both the conditions i the income tax officer having reason to believe that there has been under assessment and ii his having reason to believe that such under assessment has resulted from non disclosure of material facts must co exist before the income tax officer has jurisdiction to start proceedings after the expiry of years the argument that the court ought not to investigate the existence of one of these conditions viz that the income tax officer has reason to believe that under assessment has resulted from non disclosure of material facts cannot therefore be accepted in which of the act arose for consideration in the following terms < org > may therefore issue a high prerogative writ
139	prohibiting the income tax officer from proceeding with reassessment when it appears that the income tax officer had no jurisdiction to commence the proceeding the condition which invests the income tax officer with jurisdiction has two branches i that the income tax officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and ii that it is in consequence of information which he has in his possession that he has reason so to believe since the learned judges of < org > have concentrated their attention upon the second branch of the condition and have reached their conclusion in favour of the assessees on that branch it would be appropriate to deal with the correctness of that approach the expression information in the context in which it occurs must in our judgment mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment if as a result of information in his possession the income tax officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment the income tax officer has jurisdiction to assess or reassess income under section of the income tax act information in his possession that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment furnishes a starting point for assessing or reassessing income if he has that information the income tax officer may commence proceedings for assessment or reassessment to commence the proceeding for reassessment it is not necessary that on the materials which came to the notice of the income tax officer the previous order of assessment was vitiated by some error of fact or law < org > exercising jurisdiction under article of the constitution has power to set aside a notice issued under section of the income tax act if the condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction does not exist the court may in exercise of its powers ascertain whether the income tax officer had in his possession any information the court may also determine whether from that information the income tax officer may have reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment it is thus clear that it is open to this court to examine whether the information was such that prima facie it may be said that the < org > had reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment this leads us on to the facts of these cases as mentioned earlier the < org > had after an elaborate investigation came to the conclusion that the payments made by the assessee to its selling agents were not either excessive or unreasonable having regard to the services and facilities provided by the selling agents by applying a of the act even though the non obstante clause in a gives the provisions of that section an overriding effect over the other provisions of the act the proviso to that section
140	excludes the application of that section to any expenditure to which sub clause i of clause of of the act applies since the facts are not in dispute we shall examine whether sub clause i of clause of applies at all to the present case that sub clause refers to any expenditure incurred by a company which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any remuneration or benefit or amenity to a director or to a person who has a substantial interest in the company or to a relative of the director or of such person as the case may be section provides that it is open to the ito to determine whether the remuneration benefit or amenity is excessive or unreasonable having regard to the legitimate business needs of the company and the benefit derived by or accruing to it therefrom and also places a maximum limit on the deduction that may be claimed in respect of the aggregate of such expenditure and allowance in respect of any one person by declaring that in no case it shall exceed rs and where such expenditure or allowance relates to a period not exceeding eleven months comprised in the previous year an amount calculated at the rate of rs for each month or part thereof comprised in that period a close reading of the above provision shows that refers to an expenditure incurred by making periodical payments to a person mentioned in that clause apparently for any personal service that may be rendered by him it cannot have any reference to payments made by the assessee for all kinds of services or facilities referred to in a a it is argued that the proviso thereto suggests that any expenditure incurred for any kind of service which is referred to in the main part of a a and the expenditure referred to in belong to the same category at thus the proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest the true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail unless the words are clear the court should not so construe the proviso as to attribute an intention to the legislature to give with one hand and take away with another to put it in other words a sincere attempt should be made to reconcile the enacting clause and the proviso and to avoid repugnancy between the two if the remuneration benefit or amenity referred to in is treated as the same as what is paid in return for the goods services or facilities then irrespective of the fair market value of the goods services and facilities provided by a person who may be a director or who has a
141	substantial interest in the company or a relative of the director or of such person as the case may be only a maximum of rs they take diverse forms such as packing and forwarding transport service advertisement service warehousing facilities processing collection of price insurance of goods etc we do not think that in these circumstances payment made to such a selling agent can be treated as an expenditure referred to in of the act but a was introduced in the year in the act apparently for the purpose of preventing the abuse of excessive or unreasonable payments being made by assessee to persons referred to therein in lieu of goods services and facilities if the payments represent a fair market value then there is no limitation on the total amount payable during any period we are of the view that expenditure incurred by way of commission paid to a selling agent who acts as an independent entrepreneur with an independent organization which is not subject to the control and supervision of the assessee for the services and facilities provided by him cannot therefore be considered as equivalent to remuneration or benefit or amenity referred to in of the act in the instant case it is not disputed that < org > company the selling agents have been providing the services and facilities under the agreement as independent entrepreneurs and it has been held that the commission paid to them was not excessive at this stage it is appropriate to set out a part of the order of the < org > dated october in respect of the assessment years to it reads on a careful consideration of the facts of the case on record we are of the opinion that the commission paid to the selling agents in this case is neither excessive nor unreasonable having regard to the tests set forth in section a a if the assessee company had these facilities it would have incurred costs which the assessee had estimated at about rs as regards the legitimate business reeds we have already set out the background in which the tripartite agreement was entered into between the assessee company the foreign company and < org > and company having carefully considered all the aspects of the caes we have no hesitation in upholding the findings of the < org > arrived at on the facts of the case the total payment made to the selling agents may be in excess of rs but as long as the case does fall under there is no justification for the < org > to issue the impugned notices even though the audit party may have said so we therefore held that the < org > had no jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices under of the act as he could not reasonably entertain any doubt that any part of the assesse
142	##e income had escaped assessment by reason of not applying to the case in the result we allow these appeals reverse the common order passed by the learned single judge and quash the notices issued under of the act which are impugned in these cases we also direct the respondent in each of these cases not to take any further proceedings pursuant to the impugned notices parties shall bear their own costs [SEP]
143	[CLS] the magistrate recorded that the appellant was discharged and transferred the case for enquiry to another magistrate who after examining two witnesses ordered the issue of a non bailable warrant against the appellant for proceeding against him along with the other accused under a cr in appeal to this court held there could be no discharge of the appellant when he was not included as an accused in the charge sheet submitted by the police having taken cognizance of the offence he had to find out who the real offenders were and if he came to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some other persons were involved the summoning of the appellant as an additional accused was part of the proceeding initiated by his taking cognizance of the offence the judgment of the court was delivered by < name > this appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of < org > dismissing criminal revision no of filed by the appellant < name > the relevant facts for appreciating the points raised before us are as follows the appellant was one of the persons mentioned as assailants in the first information report dated july lodged by one < name > his name was however mentioned in column no of the charge sheet under the heading not sent up on april the sub divisional magistrate passed the following order < name > was examined and in his examinations he implicated the appellant as one of the persons who were present in the mob which is alleged to have killed < name > it appears that the counsel for < name > the person who lodged the i requested the magistrate to summon the appellant as well for trial as prayed for in the petition dated april the magistrate after hearing the assistant district prosecutor as well as the counsel for the informant and the accused passed the following order < name > is named in i and as submitted by a witnesses have named him before police and examined before me has also named him the appellant challenged this order before the sessions judge it was urged before him that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to summon the appellant because the sub divisional magistrate had already dismissed a protest petition on merits the sessions judge rejected the argument and held that it was open to the magistrate to summon any person against whom he found sufficient evidence in the case the appellant then filed a criminal revision before < org > divisional magistrate had discharged him on the first point < org > held that the order of the magistrate did not result in a separate complaint case against the appellant as the present case was instituted when the sub divisional magistrate took cognizance of an offence reported by the police and therefore the case shall be deemed to have been instituted oft the police report
144	< org > further observed that it is therefore clear from the language of section of the code that the magistrate takes cognizance of an offence made out in the police report or in the petition of complaint and there is nothing like taking cognizance of the offenders at that stage it has to be decided on the materials on record as to who actually the offenders may be only after cognizance of the offence has been taken on the facts of the instant case therefore cognizance of the offence has been taken on a police report and the order of the transferee magistrate summoning < name > does not amount to taking cognizance of an offence the sub divisional magistrate had acted on the police report alone but the magistrate took into consideration the evidence of the two prosecution witnesses examined in court as well the learned counsel for the appellant mr < name > raises two points before us first that the discharge of the appellant by the order dated april by the sub divisional magistrate was final and secondly that the proper procedure to be observed on the facts of this case was not under a but under the subsequent sections in chapter xviii of the criminal procedure code we see no force in these points there is no force in this contention because there cannot be any question of discharge when the appellant was not sent up upon the charge sheet submitted by the police coming to the second point the learned counsel for the ap pellant contends that no proceeding was instituted against the appellant on a police report within the meaning of a of the code because the appellant name was not included in the charge sheet he says that although cognizance might have been taken of an offence under no proceeding as such was instituted against the appellant at this stage the proceeding was instituted when a non bailable warrant was issued against the appellant and this proceeding was instituted not on the basis of a police report but on the basis of evidence taken before the ma gistrate and therefore he says is a proceeding falling within section i and of the code read as follows except as hereinafter provided any presidency magistrate district magistrate or sub divisional magistrate and any other magistrate specially empowered in this behalf may take cognizance of any offence a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge or suspicion that such offence has beer it seems to us that a refers back to in other words the police reportmentioned in a is the report mentioned in and once cognizance is taken under a proceeding is instituted within a in a distinction is made between
145	the classes of persons who can start a criminal prosecution under the three clauses of to which we have already referred criminal prosecution can be initiated i by a police officer by a report in writing ii upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon the magistrate own knowledge or suspicion and iii upon receiving a complaint of facts we are thus concerned to find out whether the report of the police officer in writing in this case can be described as a complaint of facts or as information received from any person other than a police officer the term complaint in this connection has been defined by the code of criminal procedure and it means the allegation made orally or in writing to a magistrate with a view to his taking action under the code that some person whether known or unknown has committed an offence but it does not include the report of a police officer it therefore follows that criminal procedure code can only apply to those cases which are instituted otherwise than on a police report that is to say upon complaints which are not reports of a police officer or upon information received from persons other than a police officer but says mr < name > that though it is true that cognizance was taken on april the cognizance was taken of the offence as far as the other accused were concerned and not as far is the appellant was concerned as a matter of fact the appellant had been rightly or wrongly discharged in our opinion once cognizance has been taken by the magistrate he takes cognizance of an offence and not the offenders once he takes cognizance of an offence it is his duty to find out who the offenders really are and once he comes to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some other persons are involved it is his duty to proceed against those persons the summoning of the additional accused is part of the proceeding initiated by his taking cognizance of an offence if a magistrate takes cognizance under a on the basis of a complaint of facts he would take cognizance and a proceeding would be instituted even though persons who had committed the offence were not known at that time the same position prevails in our view under mr < name > the learned counsel for the respondent brought to our notice some decisions which have taken the same view [SEP]

147	case in hand there being no such declaration either in the ordinance and in the act article will have no application and squarely the challenge on the ground of violation of article or has to be examined on examining article a < org > was of the opinion that two conditions must be satisfied for attracting clause of article a namely that the taking over of the management of the property by the < org > would be for a limited period and such taking over must be either in public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property since the taking over of management was not for any limited period and in fact such management had been taken over pending nationalisation the provisions of clause of article a would not get attracted according to < org > the expression pending nationalisation cannot be held to be for a limited period and the protection of article a would be available only when there is a definite limit in the law for the period of management and consequently the challenge on the anvil of violation of articles and has to be examined < org > then examined the factual aspect for considering the question as to whether there were any materials to put the three < org > in a class of < org > for which the taking over of the management was meant notwithstanding a declaration or recital in the preamble itself the same being < org > whose financial condition had become wholly unsatisfactory by reason of mis management < org > then examined the different datas collected by < org > as well as several reports including the < org > report and ultimately came to the conclusion that even though the financial condition had become unsatisfactory but the union government has failed to establish that such unsatisfactory financial condition is by reason of mis management and therefore there was no nexus between the basis of the classification of the petitioner < org > with other mismanaged < org > and the said object and the purpose of the act when the matter was listed before this court the aforesaid interim order staying the operation of the judgment was continued and later on certain misc applications being filed by different < org > certain orders have been passed by the court with regard to the possession of certain assets like car telephone connections etc when the appeals were taken up for hearing in january the same had been heard before < org > but after hearing for some time < org > felt that in view of the questions which arise for consideration and in view of clause of article of the constitution the cases should be heard by a bench of not less than five honble judges and that is why these
148	appeals were heard by us according to mr < name > this is apparent from the bill introduced by the concerned minister as well as the act itself and in such a case the < org > would not be justified in examining the datas which persuaded the < org > to take the aforesaid decision to come to a conclusion that the said decision of the < org > could not have been taken on the available materials the learned solicitor general also placed reliance on the averments made by < org > in its counter affidavit filed before < org > to indicate how it was absolutely necessary to promulgate the ordinance and how the < org > took the decision after considering the reports submitted by the < org > and other financial institutions as well as the report of the so called < org > he also placed reliance on the affidavit of mr < name > the then secretary < org > explaining the < org > report and contended that < org > was in error in basing its conclusion on the earlier affidavit of one mr < name > according to learned solicitor general that while considering the constitutional validity of a statute more particularly a statute on economic matter certain well established principles evolved by the < org > as rules of guidance in discharge of its constitutional function of judicial review have to be borne in mind and in the case in hand the impugned judgment of < org > on the face of it indicates that those guiding principles have not been borne in mind according to the learned solicitor general one cardinal principle well accepted and recognized by < org > is that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people and its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discrimination are based on adequate grounds and the presumption of constitutionality is indeed so strong that in order to sustain it the < org > may take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation he further emphasised that the law relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc it no doubt further stipulates that by reason of mis management of the affairs of the textile undertakings specified in the first schedule their financial condition became wholly unsatisfactory but the financial condition of these < org > had become so precarious and unsatisfactory as was found from the reports of different financial institutions including < org > that mis management is the natural inference and the preamble read as a whole would indicate that the
149	< org > thought it appropriate to take over the management of textile undertakings in the public interest pending nationalisation of such undertaking and in this view of the matter < org > was hyper technical in recording a finding that even though the financial condition become wholly unsatisfactory but the < org > failed to establish the mis management of the undertaking which had brought the financial condition to such unsatisfactory stage and therefore by including the three mills in question in the group of there has been violation of article the learned solicitor general also urged that in view of the prevailing situation in the < org > including the three with which we are concerned in these appeals the < org > thought that only way to put the management on the wheels was to take over the management of the < org > which is permissible in the larger public interest as contained in article a of the constitution and such < org > ary wisdom cannot be scrutinised by the < org > in a scale on the basis that certain reports might not have been placed before the < org > or on the ground that factually the < org > were not mis managed and yet had sustained heavy financial loss and thereby putting them alongwith the group of constitutes an infraction of article of the constitution according to the learned solicitor general the burden being on a person who attacks the constitutionality on the grounds of discrimination the said burden cannot be held to have been discharged by the < org > and < org > committed serious error in annulling the taking over of the management of the three < org > under the act on the ground that < org > failed to establish the relevant material before the < org > the learned solicitor general also argued that article does apply to the legislation in question and therefore infraction of article or should not have been gone into by the < org > mr < name > learned senior counsel appearing for < org > emphatically urged that article a was introduced by the constitution ivth amendment act of which enables to make law for taking over of the management of any property by the < org > for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure proper management of the same the said law permits take over only when the financial condition became unsatisfactory by reason of mis management of the affairs of < org > and this being the position if there is no material to establish that financial losses is on account of mis management then the taking over of the management of the mill by taking recourse to the impugned act must be held
150	to be invalid and < org > in fact has held it to be invalid according to mr < name > mere losses will not entitle to take over of the management of mill inasmuch as all the mills have suffered loss and therefore there must be some other factors on account of which it will be possible for the government to take over the management of only mills as included in the first schedule to the act he also further urged that in view of the language of article a the law for taking over of the management must be for a limited period and the expression pending nationalisation in the impugned act cannot be construed to be a definite limited period and therefore the act in question is not referable to article a it is in this connection he cited the decision of < name > as well as the decision of < org > in ilr delhi and also a decision of < org > in air a mr < name > also argued that in the impugned act there is intrinsic evidence to indicate that the taking over of management was not for a limited period as it would be apparent from sections and sections and and essentially it constitutes acquisition and not take over of management for a limited period mr < name > also urged that the legislative declaration of facts are not beyond judicial scrutiny in the constitutional context of articles and and the < org > can always tear the veil to decide the real nature of the statute if the facts and circumstances warrant such a course if the legislation in question was merely a pretence and the object was discrimination the validity of the statute could be examined by the < org > notwithstanding the declaration made by the legislature and therefore < org > was fully justified in examining the facts and coming to the conclusion that in grouping the three mills alongwith other mills for the purpose of taking over the management constitutes an infraction of article of the constitution according to mr < name > categorisation of the < org > mill as a mis managed mill is contrary to the facts available on record and as such it violates article mr rf < name > also contended that it was open for the writ petitioners to place and establish that the legislative facts are incorrect and in fact the petitioners have discharged that burden by placing materials on record and < org > therefore was fully justified in arriving at its decision on the materials produced mr < name > learned counsel appearing for < org > contended that < org > itself has given a positive finding on the basis of the materials those have been produced that the performance of the mill was good in view of the rival submissions the following questions
151	arise for our consideration can the impugned act be held to be a law providing for the taking over of the management of the mills for a limited period the act read as a whole expresses the intention of the < org > for taking over the management of the textile undertakings specified in the first schedule in the public interest or is it capable of indicating the legislative intent that only those mills whose financial condition became wholly unsatisfactory by reasons of mis management of the affairs of the textile undertakings which are sought to be specified in the first schedule and management of those mills are being taken over under the act there is always a presumption that the legislature does not exceed its jurisdiction and the burden of establishing that the legislature has transgressed constitutional mandates such as those relating to fundamental rights is always on the person who challenges its vires the aforesaid principle however is subject to one exception that if a citizen is able to establish that the legislation has invaded its fundamental rights then the < org > must justify that the law is saved the deponents of the affidavits filed into the court may speak for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statements the executive government may place before the court their understanding of what < org > has said or intended to say or what they think was < org > s object and all the facts and circumstances which in their view led to the legislation no act of < org > may be struck down because of the understanding or misunderstanding of parliamentary intention by the executive government or because their spokesmen do not bring out relevant circumstances but indulge in empty and self defeating affidavits they do not and they cannot bind < org > validity of legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on behalf of the < org > but by all the relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find and more especially by what may be gathered from what the legislature has itself said in the facts of that case the < org > had held that we do not entertain the slightest doubt that the nationalisation of the coking coal mines and the specified coke oven plants for the above purpose was towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good and there has been no discrimination or infringement of article of the constitution < name > in his separate judgment also agreed with the ultimate conclusion of < name > and had said that there was logical basis for the nationalisation of the oven plants of the petitioners leaving out a few and
152	i am not satisfied that there has been any wrong and arbitrary discrimination of article of the constitution while examining the constitutional validity of the special courts bill in the anvil of article of the constitution after an exhaustive review of all the decisions bearing on the question in it was held as follows the constitutional command to the state to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula therefore classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things the courts should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case the principle underlying the guarantee of article is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the indian territory or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances it only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same it can recognise even degree of evil but the classification should never be arbitrary artificial or evasive the classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational that is to say it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation in order to pass the test two conditions must be fulfilled namely that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the act the interpreter of the statute must take note of the well known historical facts in conventional language the interpreter must put himself in the armchair of those who were passing the act i the members of the < org > the aforesaid observation had been made in the context of an argument sought for by the petitioner for production of certain documents to ascertain the question whether the shares vested in the < org > or not in bearer bonds case < org > cases this < org > held that it is a rule of equal importance that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than law touching civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc the < org > observed that it has been said by no less
153	a person than < name > that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or strait jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters where having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature nowhere has this admonition been more felicitously expressed than in < name > < name > us ed where < name > said in his intimitable style in the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment the legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility the courts have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct the uncertainty the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability the < org > must always remember that legislation is directed to practical problems that the economic mechanism is highly sensitive and complex that many problems are singular and contingent that laws are not abstrct propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be measured by abstract symmetry that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are not always possible and that judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and uninterpreted experience every legislation particularly in economic matters is essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate all possible abuses there may even be possibilities of abuse but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the legislation because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some divine prescience distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses the < org > must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions this court held a xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles that it must be presumed
154	that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds that the legislature is free to recognise derees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation this court held the preamble provides the key to the general purpose of the act the general purpose or object of the act given in the preamble may not show the specific purpose of the classification made in section a and section a for achieving this the < org > may not only consider the language of section but also other public knowledge about the evil sought to be remedied the prior law the statement of the purpose of the change in the prior law and the internal legislative history when the purpose of a challenged classification is in doubt the court attribute to the classification the purpose thought to be most probable the decisions dealing with economic regulation indicate that courts have used the concept of purpose and similar situations in a manner which give considerable leeway to the < org > this approach of judicial restraint and presumption of constitutionality requires that the < org > is given the benefit of doubt about its purpose how far a court will go in attributing a purpose which though perhaps not the probable is at least conceivable and which would allow the classification to stand depends to a certain extent upon its imaginative power and its devotion to the theory of judicial restraint the < org > further held it would seem that in fiscal and regulatory matters the < org > not only entertains a greater presumption of constitutionality but also places the burden on the party challenging its validity to show that it has no reasonable basis for making the classification the legislation is primarily directed to the problems before the legislature based on information derived from past and present experience but from the very nature of things it is impossible to anticipate fully the varied situations arising in future in which the application of the legislation in hand may be called for and words chosen to communicate such indefinite reference are bound to be in many cases lacking in clarity and precision and thus giving rise to the controversial question of construction bearing in mind the aforesaid general principles let us now examine the five questions formulated earlier coming to the first question the contention of the companies who were the petitioners before < org > is that
155	under article a a law providing for taking over of the management of any property by the state for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property cannot be assailed on the ground of violation of article or but the impugned ordinance and the act cannot be held to be a law for providing for taking over of the management for a limited period even though the same may be in the public interest and as such such a law cannot be held to be immune from attack being violative of article or within the ambit of article a of the constitution this argument found favour with < org > and following the decision of this < org > in < name > case < org > held that the legislation in question cannot be held to be within the purview of article a of the constitution mr < name > the learned solicitor general appearing for < org > contended before us that it is the usual pattern of taking over of such undertaking to take over the management immediately by a law made by the appropriate legislature and since it was apparent at the time of enactment of the law that the taking over of the management is pending nationalisation which had been embodied in the legislation itself such take over of the management must be held to be for a limited period and the observations of this < org > in raman lal must be construed in the context of the facts of the said case and will have no application to the facts and circumstances of the present case mr < name > the learned senior counsel appearing for one of the mills on the other hand contended that the expression pending nationalisation by no stretch of imagination can be held to be a definite period and this has been answered directly in the case of < org > and < org > according to mr < name > there is intrinsic evidence in the impugned act itself that the so called taking over was not for a limited period as is apparent from examining sections section section and section of the act the further amendment of the constitution was made by fourth amendment act of with the object that items of agrarian and social welfare legislation which affect the proprietary rights should be kept out of the purview of articles and clause of article a provides for taking over the management of any property movable or immovable agricultural or non agricultural for a limited period without being obliged to justify its action in a < org > of law with reference to article or the necessary conditions for application of sub clause therefore are that the taking over in question must be for a limited period as distinguished from any indefinite period
156	and such taking over must be either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property which of course require to be objectively established this < org > considering the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder came to the conclusion that even though there may be a possibility of return of the land to the original owner but that does not satisfy the requirement of article a as the taking over of the management was not for a limited period but as the process of nationalisation would take a considerable period and it was thought absolutely necessary in the public interest to take over the management of the mills immediately the < org > passed the impugned legislation it is to be noticed that < org > which was also one of the mills in category iii and had been put in group ii by < org > whose management had been taken over under the provisions of textile undertakings taking over of management act had approached < org > and < org > had upheld the action of taking over but had held that the surplus lands appurtenant to the mills would not vest under sub section of section of the act but this < org > had reversed the said decision and had held that the surplus lands appurtenant to the mill did form a part of the assets in relation to the textile undertaking within the meaning of section of the act and the said land was held for the benefit of and utilised for the textile mill in question before this < org > it is true that the question of applicability of article a had not cropped up for consideration but yet certain observations of this < org > in the aforesaid case would be appropriate to be quoted there can be no doubt that the legislative intent and object of the impugned act was to secure the socialisation of such surplus lands with a view to sustain the sick textile undertakings so that they could be properly utilised by the < org > for social good i in resuscitating the dying textile undertakings hence a paradoxical situation should have been avoided by adding a narrow and pedantic construction of a provision like sub section of section of the act which provides for the consequences that ensue upon the taking over in public interest of the management of a textile undertaking under sub section thereof as a step towards nationalisation of such undertakings which was clearly against the national interest in dealing with similar legislation this < org > has always adopted a broad and liberal approach < org > has no doubt in the < org > case considered the applicability of article a and held that taking over of the management
157	pending nationalisation cannot be held to be for a limited period since there is no question of returning the property to the old management but we are unable to accept this view of < org > and we hold that the views expressed therein are not correct in law having regard to the conditions of these mills at the time of taking over of the management and having regard to the decision of < org > on the basis of data and materials to nationalise the mills falling under category iii and the ultimate policy decision of the < org > to achieve the process of nationalisation in two stages first by taking over the management of the textile undertakings and thereafter enact suitable legislation to nationalise the same the ultimate legislation for taking over the management of the mills passed by the < org > cannot but be held to be a law providing for taking over of the management for a limited period in public interest and as such the said law comes within the purview of article a of the constitution once it is held that the law is one attracting article a of the constitution then the validity of the said law cannot be assailed on the ground of violation of articles and of the constitution but since elaborate arguments had been advanced we would also examine the other questions posed by us so far as the second question is concerned the entire emphasis of the arguments advanced on behalf of < org > persuaded < org > and < org > in fact came to the conclusion in paragraph of the impugned judgment that the provisions of the act read with its objects and reasons and the preamble go to show that in the context of things the term mismanagement has been used in the impugned act not as indicating mere bad or incompetent or poor management as contended by the learned counsel for < org > but meant mismanagement having an element of fraud or dishonesty thereafter < org > examined different affidavits and materials and came to the conclusion that the question of management of the mills had no where been discussed or dealt with either directly or indirectly and that the existence of bad financial condition was in fact a general phenomena during the said period amongst < org > in bombay and the same by itself anything more could not have been an indication of bad inadequate management in paragraph of the impugned judgment the learned judges came to the ultimate conclusion in our view therefore all the circumstances mentioned above by the learned counsel for < org > do not bring out either directly or inferentially any mis management on the part of the petitioner company but on the contrary the fact that the said circumstances
158	existed even in case of some of < org > and < org > i mills show that the government could not have considered the said circumstances for concluding that the said < org > were mismanaged or their financial condition was wholly unsatisfactory by reason of such mismanagement the learned judges then held that there was no nexus between the main object or purpose of the act to take over the management of only those < org > whose financial condition before strike was wholly unsatisfactory by reason of mis management we have examined the impugned act carefully and we fail to understand that how < org > could come to a conclusion that the expression mis management has been used to indicate an element of fraud and dis honesty whereas in fact neither the provisions of the act nor the object or preamble have indicated any such intention there is no doubt a marginal area in which the courts mould or creatively interpret legislation and they are thus finishers refiners and polishers of legislation which comes to them in a state requiring varying degrees of further processing it is therefore a cardinal principle of construction of statute that the true or legal meaning of an enactment is derived by considering the meaning of the words used in the enactment in the light of any discernible purpose or object which comprehends the mischief and its remedy to which the enactment is directed applying the aforesaid principle we really fail to understand as to how the learned judges of < org > could come to a conclusion that the mismanagement must necessarily mean an element of fraud or dishonesty caution is all the more necessary in dealing with a legislation enacted to give effect to policies that are subject to bitter public and parliamentary controversy for in controversial matters there is room for differences of opinion as to what is expedient what is just and what is morally justifiable it is the < org > s opinion in these matters that is paramount it has been held in several cases that a long title along with preamble or even in its absence is a good guide regarding the object scope or purpose of the act whereas the preamble being only an abbreviation for purposes of reference is not a useful aid to construction the preamble of an act no doubt can also be read along with other provisions of the act to find out the meaning of the words in enacting provisions to decide whether they are clear or ambiguous but the preamble in itself not being an enacting provision is not of the same weight as an aid to construction of a section of the act as are other relevant enacting words to be found elsewhere in the act it is therefore said that the preamble is not to influence
159	the meaning otherwise ascribable to the enacting parts unless there is a compelling reason for it again where very general language is used in an enactment which it is clear must be intended to have a limited application the preamble may be used to indicate to what particular instances the enactment is intended to apply we cannot therefore start with the preamble for construing the provisions of an act though we could be justified in resorting to it nay we will be required to do so if we find that the language used by < org > is ambiguous or is too general though in point of fact < org > intended that it should have a limited application in coal bearing areas acquisition and development act the court was construing a notification issued under section of the said act and as in the present case the preamble of that act was to the effect an act to establish in the economic interest of india greater public control over the coal mining industry and its development by providing for the acquisition by the < org > of unworked land containing or likely to contain coal deposits or of right in or over such land for the extinguishment or modification of such rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease license or otherwise and for matters connected therewith repelling an argument advanced on behalf of the mine owners that the act intended to apply only to virgin land and not on the land which are being worked or were worked in the past because of the use of the words unworked land in the preamble this court held that the language of the enacting provisions was clear and therefore not controlled by the preamble this being the position and the textile undertakings taking over of the management act being an act providing for taking over in the public interest of the management of textile undertakings of the companies specified in the first schedule pending nationalisation of such undertakings and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto as is apparent from the long title use of the expression mis management of the affairs in the preamble will not control the purpose of the act namely the public interest and the < org > having decided to take over the management of the textile < org > which were in serious financial crisis in the public interest it was not open for the court to come to a conclusion by taking recourse to the use of the word mis management in the preamble to hold that the < org > intended only to take those < org > whose financial condition was deplorable on account of mismanagement and not in case of those mills where the financial condition may be deplorable but not on account of mis management mr < name > learned senior
160	counsel had strongly relied upon the decision of this < org > in madras race < org > case < org > whereunder the < org > struck down the provisions of madras race < org > acquisition and transfer of undertakings act on a conclusion that the declaration made in the act that the act was made to implement article was a mere cloak and there was no nexus between the act and the objects contained in article and as such the act is arbitrary in the madras case the objects and reasons as indicated in the act was that the acquisition is for a public purpose but in fact there was no material to show that any inquiry or investigation had been held by < org > in the affairs of the < org > and the < org > held that no public purpose is being served by the acquisition and transfer of the undertaking of the < org > by the < org > but in the case in hand as has been noticed by this < org > in sitaram mills case the < org > had before it several viability surveys made by different authorities like < org > < org > < org > and < org > and an independent survey by the < org > itself these surveys had been directed in ascertaining whether companies textile undertaking was a techno economically viable unit or not and whether it was desirable to provide the company with the working capital on the basis of all these informations it was decided as a matter of policy that it was desirable to achieve the process of nationalisation initially by taking over the management of the mills and thereafter by enacting suitable legislation to nationalise the same the objects and reasons of the act unequivocally indicated that the basic decision of nationalisation having been taken a genuine apprehension having arisen in the < org > s mind that unless the management of the concerned undertakings was taken over on immediate basis there might be large scale flittering away of assets which would be detrimental to the public interest and it thus became urgently necessary for < org > to take over the management of the undertakings in the public interest in this state of affairs we have no doubt in our mind that the decision in madras race < org > case will have no application to the case in hand in the case in hand < org > appears to have examined in detail the functioning of each of these three mills which had filed writ petition before it for ascertaining whether the financial conditions of those mills had deteriorated because of the
161	strike or on account of mis management and on scrutiny of different materials came to hold that < org > has failed to establish the case of mis management which in turn would mean a case of fraud and dishonesty on the part of those who were in management of the mills that apart when an act has been made by the < org > as the < org > thought the taking over of the management of the textile mills pending their nationalisation would be in the public interest it was not open for a < org > in exercise of its power of judicial review to have in depth examination of different facts and circumstances and record a conclusion as has been done in the case in hand by < org > concerned these principles will have no application to a legislation of the present nature where the < org > itself had already taken a decision to nationalise the textile mills which had undergone severe financial crisis and such mills could not be re started without pumping in large amount of money from the public exchequer and therefore the legislation in question was passed to take over the management of the mills immediately as such take over was in the public interest the argument advanced on behalf of the mills and the microscopic examination of datas by the < org > for arriving at a conclusion as to the alleged violation of article of the constitution is not permissible and will not override the legislative intent behind taking over of management of the mills in the larger public interest we are unable to agree with the arguments advanced on behalf of the counsel appearing for the respondents that by picking up the three mills who had approached < org > and clubbing them together with other mills in the fist schedule the government did not have germane considerations before it in fact it is not the executive government but the < org > itself had chosen to take over the management of the mills included in the first schedule to the impugned act and for that purpose the impugned legislation was enacted and the management of the mills could be taken over by operation of law supreme < org > cases that the textile mills and < org > in india has played an important role in the growth of national economy its importance in the industrial field is because of the fact that it produces an essential commodity and the export of such commodity helps in building up the foreign exchange reserve of the country simultaneously the industry gives employment to a large number of persons this < org > had also taken note of the fact that < org > was required to evolve a scheme to put < org > on its rail and therefore after getting
162	the matter investigated by committee and after recommending that < org > and < org > should finance and put through expeditiously the re habilitation programme and having accepted the categorisation made in the meeting called by < org > on october and having realised that none of the mills in category iii could be expected to survive on a sound basis without financial assistance from the government controlled institutions and < org > s and thereafter obtaining a detailed viability report from the < org > and < org > which was constituted by < org > the government decided that the mills in question should be re habilitated by injecting public funds but since the management of the mills has been defective in as much as had there been no mis management the mills would not be found themselves in the conditions in which they were even before the general strike as the matter of policy it was desirable to achieve the process of nationalisation in two stages taking over of the management and thereafter suitable legislation to nantionalise the same and the taking over of management was with a view to implement the decision of nationalisation the fact that in some of the reports indicating viability of the mills on large scale money being pumped in would not in any way affect the ultimate conclusion of the < org > in providing for a law to take over in the public interest the management of textile undertakings of the companies specified in the first schedule as the danger of pumping in of large sum from the public exchequer without taking over the management of the mills would not have been a prudent action as has been stated earlier and as is apparent from the long title of the act itself that the decision to nationalise the mills had already been taken but pending nationalisation the mills in question including the mills of the three petitioners who filed writ petition bombay high < org > the management was taken over by the impugned legislation as otherwise there was imminent danger to the finance to be pumped in to the for its revival and revival was necessary to provide employment to the large number of mill workers in the aforesaid premises we have no hesitation to come to a conclusion on the materials on record the < org > ary action in legislating the law and taking over of the management of all the mills included in the first schedule to the act cannot be held to be discriminatory nor < org > was justified in recording a conclusion about the true intention of the legislation that it is only the mis managed mills whose financial condition had deteriorated the management of
163	those to be taken over and not others in other words while the act of taking over of the management of the mills was in the public interest the inference of mis management was the inference of the < org > duly arrived at from the fact that the financial condition of the mills had become wholly unsatisfactory even before the commencement in january and such financial condition has further deteriorated thereafter this inference of the < org > is not subject to a mathematical judicial scrutiny and the way in which < org > has gone into this question in the impugned judgment is certainly not within the para meters of the power of high < org > under article of the constitution so far as the fifth question is concerned though it is no doubt true that the < org > would be justified to some extent in examining the materials for finding out the true legislative intent engrafted in a statute but the same would be done only when the statute itself is ambiguous or a particular meaning given to a particular provision of the statute it would make the statute unworkable or the very purpose of enacting the statute would get frustrated as has been stated earlier in the case in hand the taking over of management statute of had been engrafted in the public interest as the legislature found that there is imperative need to take over of the management of the companies until the process of nationalisation is finalised the preamble further indicates that the process of acquisition would take a longer time and to enable < org > to invest large sum of money it was necessary in the public interest to take over the management of the undertakings apart from answering the five points formulated by us we may also deal with some other ancillary points which have been raised in course of arguments but we find from the impugned judgment that the said contention had not been pressed before < org > and therefore we are not called upon to examine the contention to find out whether the act can be held to be reasonable and fair this being the position article a will have no application in the aforesaid case the < org > was considering the validity of the notification issued by < org > in canceling the confirmation of the bye laws made by jabalpur municipality in so far as the bye laws relate to slaughter of bulls and bullocks this < org > had observed that the < org > in considering the validity of the impugned law imposing a prohibition on the carrying on of a business or profession attempt an evaluation of its direct and immediate impact upon the fundamental rights of the citizens affected thereby and the larger public interest sought to be ensured in the
164	light of the object sought to be achieved the necessity to restrict the citizens freedom the inherent pernicious nature of the act prohibited or its capacity or tendency to be harmful to the general public the possibility of achieving the object by imposing a less drastic restraint and in the absence of exceptional situations such as the prevalence of a state of emergency national or local or the necessity to maintain essential supplies or the necessity to stop activities inherently dangerous the existence of a machinery to satisfy the administrative authority that no case for imposing the restriction is made out or that a less drastic restriction may ensure the object intended to be achieved it is these observations on which mr < name > strongly relied upon since in the case in hand the appropriate < org > did not take any action under the provisions of the companies act nor there had been any investigation as provided under section and a of the industrial development and regulation act according to mr < name > obviously those provisions are less drastic in nature than the impugned act and in fact there was no urgent necessity for enacting a law and taking a drastic measure of taking over the management of the mills we are unable to accept this contention since we have already discussed the public interest involved and how the < org > thought of taking over the management of the mills without which it would not be feasible to pump in large sums of money from the public exchequer and leave the management with the erstwhile managers for whose mismanagement the mills would not have been in the situation in which the law was enacted the decision to take over the management of the mills with a view to implement the decision to nationalise the mills being the basis for enactment of the taking over of the management of the mills act question of taking recourse to the remedies available under the companies act or industries development and regulation act really do not arise and on that score it cannot be said that there has been a violation of article we may reiterate that we are examining the enactment of a law by the < org > itself and the wisdom of the < org > in taking a decision to take over the management of the mills in the larger public interest and not an executive decision of the < org > which could have taken recourse to some other remedial measure provided under the industries development and regulation act or the companies act if < org > decides to enact a law for taking over the management of < org > pending completion of the process of nationalisation on a genuine apprehension that there might be a large scale flittering away of assets if the management is

167	different footing as a matter of fact in that case an execution petition filed by the objector apparently was pending at any rate at the time the insolvency petition was filed but apart from this it seems to me with all respect that the reasoning of the learned judges does not justify such an extension of the article and i observe that they expressly say they do not seek to lay down any general principle and desire to confine their judgment to the unusual facts before them ramesam certainly says there is no warrant for the view that an application to take a step is aid of execution should be made in execution meaning apparently while an execution is pending but he gives no reasons and does not discuss the point and with all respect i feel compelled to dissent i must therefore hold that the counter petition exhibit is not an application to take a step in aid of execution nor does exhibit this is the plaint filed by appellant in the last mentioned suit seeking to set aside a settlement deed executed by respondent in respect of certain immovable properties as void under section of the transfer of property act i cannot see how by any stretch of reasoning the presentation of this plaint could be treated as an application to take a step in aid of execution of the decree in original suit no of an alternative contention put forward by appellant is that he is entitled to ask that the time during which execution application no of was pending should not be counted against him this plea does not profess to be based on anything in the limitation act but reliance is placed on the decision of a bench of three judges of < org > < name > < name > i calc in which it appears to have been held that the relaxations of the ordinary law of limitation provided in the limitation act are not exhaustive and that in the case then under consideration the plaintiffs were entitled to count in their favour the period during which they were precluded from bringing their suit by reason of the existence of a decree in a previous suit which covered the same matter in that case stress was laid on the fact that the prior decree if relief against limitation is to be allowed in cases not provided for in the limitation act surely this should only be done in cases where justice and equity clearly require it the decision in that case turned on a construction of article limitation act with which we have no concern bat the principle of suspension and the question of whether < org > intended to lay down any rule as to the exhaustiveness of the exemptions contained in the limitation act were no doubt discussed and were in fact the points raised in the reference that even if it is open to us to
168	allow a suspension of time not provided for in the limitation act there is no justification for doing so here i would dismiss the appeal with costs [SEP]

170	to review the evidence and to arrive at its own independent conclusion whether the appeal is against conviction or acquittal but while dealing with an appeal against acquittal the appellate court has to bear in mind first that there is a general presumption in favour of the ignorance of the person accused in criminal cases that presumption is only strengthened by the acquittal the second is every accused is entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt regarding his guilt and when the trial court acquitted him he would retain that benefit in the appellate court also thus appellate court in appeals against acquittals has to proceed more cautiously and only if there is absolute assurance of the guilt of the accused upon the evidence on record that the order of acquittal is liable to the interfered with or disturbed trial court which relied on the evidence of < name > pw pointed out that the witness did not refer to any role played by < name > when he gave statement to the police during investigation and hence a conviction for the offence of murder cannot be passed against < name > on the strength of improvement made at the trial we have scrutinized the evidence and we too are satisfied that pw < name > has in fact omitted to mention anything about < name > when pw was questioned by police and has later on tried to give an improved version we are therefore of the opinion that the order of acquittal passed by the trial court in favour of < name > should have been maintained by < org > we agree with the findings recorded by the courts below and are of the opinion that their conviction and sentence are well merited there is no merit in their appeal we set aside the conviction and sentence passed on < name > and restore the order or acquittal passed by < org > in his favour [SEP]

173	this substantially reproduces the provision in section of geo iii which debarred the supreme < org > from exercising jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue a distinction may thus legitimately be drawn between a reference made in connection with an assessment on a person who resides in the town of calcutta that is within the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this < org > and a reference made in connection with an assessment on a person who resides beyond the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of his < org > in the present case the assessment under section was made by the collector of tipperah and the order under section which ultimately came under examination by < org > was made by the commissioner of < org > consequently the procedure which governs appeals from the < org > in the provinces within the meaning of clause of the letters patent is applicable to the reference made by < org > under section and on such reference < name > s but not attorneys are entitled to appear there no such question was raised possibly for the reason that as the company though owning property situated at naogaon in assam had its registered office at clive street calcutta and might consequently be deemed under section to have its principal place of business within the town of calcutta the assessment was in fact made by the collector of income tax calcutta that < name > s had no right of audience in < org > in cases sent up for trial under act xiv of where the < org > was equally divided in opinion upon the question whether < name > s were entitled to be heard in a proceeding under section of the criminal procedure code instituted in a < org > small cause < org > and brought up before < org > in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction or of its power of superintendence nor is any light thrown on the point before us by the practice in connection with references under section of the indian stamp act such references so far as we have been able to discover have hitherto been made mostly in connection with matters arising within the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this < org > and in such cases claim to a right of audience would not ordinarily be put forward by < name > s but in one instance at least reference under stamp act where the question arose in relation to < org > from the < org > counsel appeared with a < name > at the hearing we have next to consider the questions referred by < org > to this court for decision is selami or premium agricultural

178	[CLS] in this reference under section of the income tax act at the instance of the commissioner of income tax the following two questions have been referred to this court for the assessment year whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the assessee can claim as deduction the provision for payment of leave salary in the year under consideration at the suggestion of the learned advocates we have reframed the first question as follows to bring out the real controversy whether on the facts and in the circumstances of this case the additional expenditure incurred by reason of exchange fluctuation in respect of the payment of the instalments of loan in japanese yen obtained for the purchase of machinery on deferred payment basis was capital or revenue expenditure the facts relating to the first question are stated hereafter the claim of the assessee for the deduction of the said amount under section a of the act has been negatived by the income tax officer on the ground that the said loss was capital and not revenue in nature because the loss arose in making instalment payments of the purchase price of the machineries which were capital assets of the assessee there is no dispute that the loss relates to capital in the sense that in respect of certain loans which were to be repaid by the assessee they were incurred in acquiring capital assets and the loss arose the decision in < org > has no application as it is a case of loss on devaluation in that case the < org > has taken the view that foreign loans were obtained by the assessee in the course of business which were ultimately utilised for the purchase of plant and machinery it is his contention that in the instant case whatever extra payment in terms of rupees was made by the assessee must be taken to be an unavoidable expenditure in connection with the loan he has relied on various decisions in support of his contention a number of cases have been cited before us but it seems to us that the answer to the question depends on whether the act of keeping the money i for capital purposes after obtaining the sanction of < org > was part of or a trading transaction there is no doubt that the amount of was a revenue receipt in the assessee business of commission agency instead of repatriating it immediately the assessee obtained the sanction of < org > to utilise the commission in its business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives for buying capital goods in our view it was not a trading transaction in the business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives it was clearly a transaction of accumulating dollars to pay for capital goods the first step in the
179	acquisition of capital goods if the assessee had repatriated and then after obtaining the sanction of < org > remitted to the a mr < name > does not contest that any profit made on devaluation would have been a capital profit but in our opinion the fact that the assessee kept the money there does not make any difference especially as we have pointed out when it was a new transaction which the assessee entered into the transaction being the first step in the acquisition of capital goods the law may therefore now be taken to be well settled that where profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by it on conversion into another currency such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business but if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature if these two amounts were employed in the business in west pakistan and formed part of the circulating capital of that business the loss of rs resulting to the assessee on the remittance of those two amounts to india on account of alteration in the rate of exchange would be a trading loss but if instead these two amounts were held on capital account and were part of fixed capital the loss would plainly be a capital loss the question whether the loss suffered by the assessee was a trading loss or a capital loss cannot therefore be answered unless it is first determined whether these two amounts were held by the assessee on capital account or on revenue account or to put it differently as part of fixed capital or of circulating capital mr < name > for the assessee has contended in the course of his submissions that a loss has to be considered in a different way from a gain in computing business profits there may be cases where a loss dehors the business is allowed as a business loss whereas a gain arising in similar circumstances will never be a business gain in our view this distinction again is of little significance as the gain or the loss as the case may be has to be connected with the business before the same can enter into the computation of profits on a scrutiny of the facts of the instant case it appears to us that as a result of the devaluation which befell the assessee it became immediately liable to an extra liability in terms of its rupee assets for repayment of its debts this extra expenditure deemed
180	or otherwise or this loss is inextricably connected with the assessee indebtedness and did not arise dehors the indebtedness nor was it incurred for the purposes of the loan and it was as if from the date of the devaluation the dues from the assessee to its creditors in rupees were increased we are unable to accept the contentions of mr < name > that the extra amount which the assessee had to provide for as a result of the devaluation is to be considered as extra expenditure to be incurred for meeting the debt just as postal expenses or bank charges or this extra expenditure which would result in a business loss of a revenue nature in that case the assessee entered into an agreement on december with an italian company for the purchase of machinery at the total value working out to rs the agreement further provided that the italian company should draw bills of exchange on the assessee which were to be accepted by the assessee and payments of which were to be guaranteed by < org > the agreement also provided for payment in terms of british sterling calculated at the prevalent exchange rate between sterling and the dollar and if there should be variation in the exchange rate the same should be separately settled with credit notes in rupees or in lire in favour respectively of the italian company or the assessee as the case may be similarly the assessee had to pay a larger amount on account of fluctuations in exchange rate in respect of other instalments in on the aforesaid facts < org > held that as the price fixed under the agreement was only a tentative price which had to be discharged at the prevailing rates of exchange at the time of the respective payments the payments related only to the purchase price of the machinery and the difference was on capital account and not allowable as business expenditure act with effect from april would not in any way affect the point in issue which has to be considered in the light of the actual nature of the payment that had to be made and in the light of the provisions in force but if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature the learned advocate for the assessee also emphasised that there < org > was dealing essentially with the assessee own money therefore according to him < org > had no occasion to advert to this aspect of the matter where in a case the assessee was dealing with borrowed money then this court considered the scope of section a of the act at page the court referred to the object of
181	the finance bill which introduced section a bill which introduced section a clause of the notes on clauses sought to explain the purpose of such insertion which reads as follows itr st clause seeks to insert a new section a in the income tax act the proposed section a in substance secures that where an assessee had acquired any capital asset from a country outside india for the purposes of his business or profession on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan before the date of devaluation of the rupee the additional rupee liability incurred by him in meeting the instalments of the cost of the asset or of the foreign loan as the case may be falling due for payment after the date of devaluation will be allowed to be added to the original actual cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating the allowance on account of depreciation in computing the profits for the assessment year and subsequent assessment years similar increase in the original actual cost will be allowed to be made in respect of the capital assets acquired by the assessee to be used in scientific research related to the class of business carried on by him or patent rights or copyrights acquired from abroad or any capital asset acquired by a company for the purpose of promoting family planning amongst its employees further in computing the capital gains arising to the assessee on the sale or transfer of a capital asset acquired by him from abroad on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan the additional rupee liability incurred by him in repaying the instalments of the cost or the foreign loan as the case may be after the date of devaluation of the rupee will be added to the original actual cost of the asset the proposed section also secures that where there is a decrease in the rupee liability of the assessee in respect of assets acquired by him from abroad due to a change in the exchange value of the rupee the original actual cost of the asset will be correspondingly reduced the additional rupee liability incurred on imported capital assets or as the case may be any decrease in such liability in the circumstances stated in the earlier paragraph will not however be taken into account in computing the actual cost of the asset for the purpose of deduction on account of development rebate therefore any appreciation or depreciation in value of assets as a result of devaluation in profit or loss arising therefrom must be governed by the special provisions of section a a special provision has been made and this is the only provision to guide the matter before we deal with that aspect of the matter we must refer to section which uses a non obstante clause of stc that apart even if article continues the pre constitution laws
182	of taxation that provision is expressly made subject to the other provisions of the constitution the expression subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject further article opens out with a non obstante clause while article is subject to article article operates in its own sphere in spite of article the result is that article overrides article that is to say notwithstanding the fact that a pre constitution taxation law continues in force under article the < org > and the state governments can enter into an agreement in terms of article in respect of part states depriving the state law of its efficacy in one view article excludes the operation of article and in the other view an agreement in terms of article overrides article in either view the result is the same namely that at any rate during the period covered by the agreement the states ceased to have any power to impose the tax in respect of works contracts it states in essence that in spite of what is contained previously this clause would be operative another significant fact has to be borne in mind that sub section of section a deals with the expression acquisition which deals with the situation where there is a change in the valuation of foreign currency after acquisition but in the case of development rebate it has to be emphasised that acquisition is not relevant on the material date but the date of installation is the most material date at page the court observed as follows in the instant case before us the contract stipulated repayment in dollars therefore the actual cost of the assessee must be computed on the dollar value therefore anything which went into that repayment that is to say any cost which actually went in repaying the debt must be in our opinion on the principle of computation of the actual cost which irrespective of section a would be entitled to development rebate under section a and inasmuch as sub section of section a only excludes the portion of sub section of section a in our opinion this position would not be inadmissible that the assessee would be entitled to obtain the development rebate in the instant case we are concerned with the question whether section was at all meant for dealing with the case where there is no question of installation involved but only acquisition was the relevant fact cit itr and at page observed as follows in so far as the decision took the view that in respect of all devaluation cases irrespective of whether the stipulated payment in the matter of foreign currency should be made under section a alone with great respect we are unable to agree and we prefer to adhere to the former view of < org > and the other view of < org
183	> as mentioned hereinbefore on behalf of the assessee it was contended that section a has been introduced to meet with the situation of computing depreciation year after year where the price in terms of indian rupee fluctuates on account of change in the rate of exchange but since no such situation arises in the cases of development rebate which is granted once and for all the said provision has not been made applicable to the computation of development rebate the development rebate continues to be computed on the basis of the provisions of section as before it was linked with the actual cost of the machinery or plant to the assessee therefore on the relevant date when the contract was entered into it was entered into with the direction to pay back in dollars and whatever was necessary to pay back must be treated as actual cost to the assessee having regard to the principles laid down by the aforesaid decisions we are unable to accept the contention of mr < name > there is no qualitative difference in the additional expenditure incurred due to the devaluation or fluctuation in the rate of exchange although in that case the court was concerned with a case of devaluation the principles laid down therein will equally apply to a case like this where the additional liability arises because of fluctuation in the rate of exchange as laid down in < org > this extra expenditure deemed or otherwise or this loss is inextricably connected with the assessee indebtedness and did not arise dehors the indebtedness nor was it incurred for the purpose of the loan and it was as if from the date of the devaluation the dues from the the assessee to its creditors in rupees were increased this case has no application to the facts of this case as the extra expenditure was not incurred to obtain the loan it is at the point of repayment of the loan that the assessee has to provide an extra amount in rupees by reason of the fluctuation in the rate of exchange the decision relied on by mr < name > in the case of < org > also does not assist him there the assessee had taken a loan from < org > of washington for making payment in the a of the price of capital plant and machinery purchased for its project one of the questions was whether the increase in liability of the assessee for repayment of loan due to devaluation was allowable deduction in computing the business income of the assessee there the court considered various decisions including the decision in the case of < org > thus whether there is devaluation or whether there is fluctuation in the rate of exchange the fact remains that the exchange rate goes against the assessee
184	resulting in increase in the liability and there cannot be any difference in principle in deciding the question in < org > the alternative argument of the assessee that development rebate should have been allowed on the increased liability arising out of devaluation attributable to plant and machinery was accepted even the observation of this court in that context also does not support the contention of mr < name > the principle which has been laid down in < org > by this court is that if the contract stipulates repayment in foreign currency the actual cost of the asset must be computed on the value of the foreign currency anything which went into the repayment was part of the actual cost of the capital asset thus in the instant case also the extra expenditure incurred by the assessee would be towards the cost of plant and machinery and accordingly it will be on capital account we therefore answer the first question by saying that the additional expenditure incurred by reason of exchange fluctuation was capital expenditure now we shall take up the second question the facts relating to the second question are stated hereunder according to the leave rules of the assessee one of the leaves to which the employees of the assessee are entitled is known as privilege leave rule of the said leave rules further provides the method for encashment of leave by different categories of employees rule a further provides that without prejudice to the aforesaid general provisions for encashment of leave the management shall have the right at its sole discretion to permit encashment of any number of days of accumulated privilege leave not exceeding days in cases like marriage sickness accident or other special circumstances beyond reasonable control of the person concerned like refusal of leave by the management etc it is also an admitted position that prior to the year under consideration the assessee was claiming the deduction in the matter of payment on account of privilege leave when the same was encashed on retirement or on the termination of the services of the employees in a particular year though this was the practice in the past the assessee in the accounts for the year made a provision in respect of its accrued liability for payment of accumulated leave earned by the employee amounting to rs the claim of the assessee for the deduction of the said amount had been negatived by the income tax officer on the ground that the liability is a contingent liability the tribunal upheld the contention of the assessee and inter alia observed as follows no doubt in the past the assessee was claiming the deduction only to the extent to which the said privilege leave was encashed by an employee on retirement or on termination of his service yet that is not conclusive on
185	the subject once the privilege leave is earned by an employee it gets credited to his account it has been contended by mr < name > with reference to the leave rules that the liability accrues to the assessee for payment of leave wages as soon as leave under the rules has become due to the employees he has particularly referred to the following rules in support of his contention privilege leave i every permanent employee shall be entitled to privilege leave at the rate of thirty days for every completed period of twelve months ii privilege leave will be credited to the account of each individual at the end of each financial year of the company or calendar year as may be applicable hereinafter referred to as the year iii privilege leave will accumulate up to days only the management shall have the right at its sole discretion to permit encashment of any number of days of accumulated privilege leave not exceeding days mr < name > has also drawn our attention to rule which is in the following terms for the purpose of leave encashment the leave record will be completed immediately after the end of every calendar year or financial year of the company and the benefit of unavailed or accumulated leave if any shall be given as per these rules in the succeeding calendar year or financial year as the case may be he has also submitted that out of the provision made leave salary would be paid to the employees this will depend on whether he actually avails himself of the leave or not if leave is due to a person he has the option either to accumulate the leave or he may avail of the leave if he avails of the leave he would be entitled to the leave salary if he does not he will be entitled to the benefit of encashment of the leave he has relied on several decisions in support of his contention being the amount set apart as a reserve fund in its balance sheet for the payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under section of the factories act it was held that the liability that rests on the employer to pay a worker wages in accordance with section for leave period remains a contingent liability which the employer may or may not be called upon to discharge that being so any sum set apart by an employer in any year for meeting the contingency of some of his workers going on leave the next year cannot be regarded as a permissible expenditure under section xv of the indian income tax act the liability under section of the factories act to pay holiday wages depends on the arising of circumstances specified therein and since they may or may not arise the liability is only a contingent and uncertain liability which may or
186	may not have to be discharged of itr it should be clear from what i have stated above that such statutory liability for holiday wages as the factories act creates is only a contingent liability which may or may not have to be discharged and secondly the measure of that liability can never be known in advance it cannot be so known because it cannot be known in advance how many employees will avail themselves of how many holidays and when and necessarily at what rate holiday wages would be payable in those circumstances it is perfectly clear that not only is the amount claimed not allowable as an item of expenditure because in fact no expenditure had been incurred and not a pica had gone out of the funds of the company but also that the amount does not even represent a certain liability which will have to be discharged in any event it may be that although a particular amount is not actually expended during the currency of a particular accounting year the assessee will still be entitled to a deduction if a certain liability for its payment has arisen so that it may be said that the expenditure is as good as made the amount claimed in the present case is certainly not even of that character and as i have already pointed out it is not an amount which was actually spent for payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under section of the factories act and claimed deduction in respect of that amount on the footing that it had incurred a liability to pay leave wages to its employees in the year of account it is true that this court as well as the madhya pradesh and bombay high courts considered the scope of the provisions of the factories act regarding the payment of holiday wages and upon the consideration of the relevant provisions the courts held that the liability was contingent the principles which have been laid down in those cases in our opinion would equally apply to the facts of this case leave wages are payable only when a person goes on leave and during the period of leave the wages paid to him are known as leave wages it cannot be ascertained with any certainty whether in a particular year the employees would go on leave or the leave would be granted to them the liability will only arise when a person goes on leave and it is only for that particular month or months he is on leave the leave wages are payable similarly in the case of wages which are paid during the leave period the employee becomes entitled to such leave wages only when he goes on leave there the assessees were partners of a firm which was engaged in the business of processing and
187	exporting cashew kernels for the assessment year relevant to the valuation date december the assessees claimed deduction in respect of the amounts payable by the firm by way of leave with wages in calculating their interest in the firm for purposes of wealth tax the < org > found that subsequent to the decision of < org > in < org > < org > a practice came to be crystallised in the cashew industry in kerala making it obligatory for the management to pay the workers leave with wages contemplated under section of the factories act irrespective of the number of days they worked on a reference < org > held that the amounts in question did not relate to a contingent or future liability but to an existing liability liability which had already been incurred as a result of the practice which had as found by the < org > come to be crystallised in the cashew industry following an earlier decision of the court hence these were amounts in the nature of debts which could be taken into account for computation under the wealth tax act it is therefore clear that there is no obligation on the employer to pay the leave wages irrespective of the number of days worked by the employee as in the kerala case < org > in that case was concerned inter alia with the question whether it is legitimate in a scheme of gratuity to estimate the liability on actuarial valuation and deduct such estimated liability in the profit and loss account while working out the net profit < org > held that if the liability is properly ascertainable and if it is possible to arrive at its discounted present value even if the liability is a contingent liability it can be taken into account the rate of leave salary will depend on the salary a person draws at the time when he goes on leave and not when the leave is accumulated he will only be entitled to encash such accumulated leave when he retires or his services are terminated or determined the contention of mr < name > has no substance and must fail the second question is therefore answered in the negative and in favour of the < org > [SEP]

200	of the defendant to play fraud by misrepresenting his goods as the goods of the appellant he said inasmuch as you and certainly not to impute fraud without proof you are not to suggest that people are fradulently committing some commercial trick without sufficient evidence and i cannot conceive here how anybody could gravely argue that the one thing could be mistaken for the other by anybody who looked as it that brings us finally to the question of the failing memory of the customer it has now been held that there are limitations to the theory of imperfect memory it says the < org > must bear in mind that the marks will not normally be seen side by side and quard against the danger that a person seeing the new mark may think that it is the same as one he has seen before or even that it is a new or associated mark of the proprietor of the formal mark marks are often remembered by general impressions of by same essential feature < org > rpc pc on appeal rpc who are the persons who go to purchase < org > corn flakes prima facie in our opinion these people belong to a middle class or upper middle class and above who are fairly educated in english and are able to distinguish < org > and what is not < org > para page it is said that it is necessary to note the fact that customers for fasteners are sophisticated and discerning that defendant acted with goods faith < name > in fact observed in the above case of course one knows that the persons who buy these articles are generally persons of some education my opinion is having regard to the nature of the customer the article in question and the price at which it is likely to be sold and all the surrounding circumstances no man of ordinary intelligence is likely to be deceived we are on the facts of the case before us prima facie of the same opinion in regard to < org > and < org > learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on < org > < name > supra prima facie the case goes against the view expressed by < org > in the cases referred to above further this case has been placed in a special category by writers because here the picture of the sweets on the top of the boxes was so similar spreading over the entire face of the box and the learned judge felt more impressed by that fact though the names were not so similar this view appears from halsbury law of england th ed < name > says para that this case was treated as
201	a case of deliberate copying offending plaintiff copyright it was also held that there was infringement of registered trade mark so far as passing off was concerned it was seen as a case where having regard to the arrangement of the picture of the sweets on the top of the box that a person with imperfect memory could be misled in the result on our prima facie conclusions we reject the plea of similarity or likelihood of confusion we reject the plea of fraud as well as the one based on imperfect memory we are of the view prima facie that even though the get up is similar the different names < org > and < org > prominently displayed make all the difference and this is not a fit case for interference with the order of the learned single judge refusing injunction these are prima facie views and it is made clear that the suit will be disposed of on the basis of such evidence as may be produced therein without being influenced by anything said here [SEP]
202	[CLS] as all the cases involve similar questions of fact and law they were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment we may however notice the fact of the matter involved in civil appeal nos of it is engaged in the business of generation of electricity pursuant or in furtherance of the said request a notification was issued in terms of section of the land acquisition act for short the act notifying the intention of < org > to acquire bighas biswas and biswanis equivalent to acres of lands situated at the aforementioned village on the premise that generation of electricity was extremely urgent and national capital region faced acute shortage of electricity the emergency provisions contained in sections and of the act were invoked as the provisions of sub section of section of the act were applied notices were issued on th october under section of the act to the claimants for payment of compensation in respect of the acquired land a possession certificate was issued by the collector on th january which reads as under possession certificate land permanent required for the planned industrial construction of ntpc plant district ghaziabad through < org > ghaziabad certified that i on behalf of the collector ghaziabad have on this day the taken over the possession of the land detailed below comprising an area bs or acres and not legible name not ligible of a office to hand over the possession of the same land to < org > ghaziabad a reference in terms of section of the act was made which was answered by the learned additional district judge ghaziabad by a order dated nd october determining the amount of compensation rs per sq inter alia on the premise that possession of the entire land of acres had not been obtained the district magistrate was approached for issuance of a notification denotifying the acquisition of the balance area i for withdrawal of acquisition of land admeasuring acres by its letter dated th february < org > submitted a proposal as regards denotification of the land which reads as under kindly refer to our letter no gm dated january on the above subject addressed to district land acquisition officer and copy endorsed to you copy enclosed for ready reference in continuation of para of that letter this is to inform you that there are five cases in which delivery of possession is shown to have been given in many cases their crops are standing on the land in question further it may be added that the land acquisition amendment act came into force as per sub section a to section of the land acquisition act it is made obligatory that before taking possession of any land the collector shall pay of
203	the compensation to the interested persons this mandatory provision not having been complied with the delivery of possession on paper has no legal force and that is why land owners did not allow < org > to take possession of these lands since no legally valid possession has been given to < org > nor land owners have allowed < org > to take possession of these lands mutations in revenue records made need to be set right by necessary correction proceedings on th november the state of issued a notification in terms of section of the act aggrieved respondents filed a writ application before < org > on or about th august and a division bench of < org > stayed the consequential effect of the notification dated th november on or about th september the appellant filed an application for vacating the stay which having been refused a special leave petition was filed before this court which was dismissed by an order dated th october indisputably on the same day the same bench passed judgment in < org > preferred by appellant < org > against the order of < org > dated nd october we shall deal with the said matter separately mr < name > learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the < org > would contend that although in the event possession had been taken by the collector from the land owners section of the act will have no application but in view of the fact that possession of acres of land had not been delivered in favour of < org > and merely a symbolic possession had been delivered < org > must be held to have committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment mr < name > learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents on the other hand would contend i having regard to the provisions contained in section of the act as the vesting of the acquired land takes place immediately the impugned notification dated th november has rightly been held to be illegal and without jurisdiction iii the fact that the possession of the entire land had been taken over not only would appear from the materials brought on record during the land acquisition proceedings culminating in passing of the award but also from the award of < org > as also the judgment of < org > in the first appeals and in that view of the matter it would not be correct to contend that < org > could not have entered into such disputed questions of fact particularly when the validity or otherwise of the proceedings is not in question emergency provisions contained in section of the act were resorted to sub sections a and of the act read as under in cases of urgency whenever the appropriate < org > so directs the collector though
204	no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any waste or arable land needed for a public purpose a before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section in the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate government may direct that the provisions of section a shall not apply and if it does not so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section indisputably the said provisions were been taken recourse to and thus the lands under acquisition vested absolutely in the government section of the act providing for taking over possession of the land after making the award would not be applicable in this case as possession is said to have already been taken over in terms of sub section of section thereof it is in the aforementioned backdrop of factual matrix the power of the < org > to withdraw the notification of acquisition as envisaged under section of the act falls for our consideration the said provision is as under section completion of acquisition not compulsory but compensation to be awarded when not completed except in the case provided for in section the government shall be at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken whenever the government withdraws from any such acquisition the collector shall determine the amount of compensation due for the damage suffered by the owner in consequence of the notice or of any proceedings thereunder and shall pay such amount to the person interested together with all costs reasonably incurred by him in the prosecution of the proceedings under this act relating to the said land it is a well settled proposition of law that in the event possession of the land in respect whereof a notification had been issued had been taken over the state would be denuded of its power to withdraw from the acquisition in terms of section of the act whether actual or symbolic possession had been taken over from the land owners is essentially a question of fact taking over of possession in terms of the provisions of the act would however mean actual possession and not
205	symbolic possession all other legal requirements to invoke the said provision have been complied with mr < name > however would draw our attention to a letter dated issued by the appellant to the district magistrate to contend that even payment of of the compensation had not made and thus the purported delivery of possession was merely a papr transaction our attention had further been drawn to the written statement filed on behalf of the appellant before the reference court which reads as under that out of the total acquired area in question the respondent utilized only a portion of the land by construction of their satellite building while remaining area could not be put into use by the respondent since the land is in actual physical possession of the land owners and they are deriving all the benefits from the land thereof and the respondent is having only a symbolic possession over the same we may notice some of the statements recorded therein we may quote hereinbelow the relevant portions from the said award < org > also in its judgment held the petitioners will get per annum as additional amount on the above market value for the period commencing from the date of publication of the notification in the memo of appeal preferred by the appellant before < org > a statement was made that the possession of the land was taken by invoking section of the act on and thus interest at the rate of per annum on the excess amount under the provisions of section of the act would be payble only in the case where such excess payment had not been made before the expiry of one year period from the date on which the possession has been taken and as determined by the < org > in view of the stand taken by the appellant before < org > as also the reference court and < org > in our opinion it is estopped and precluded from raising a plea contra the reference < org > in paragraph of its judgment also noticed that the possession of the land has been taken over on no objection was taken before the reference < org > that possession had not been taken and thus interest was not payable even before us the only ground taken was that the land could not be put to use which is a non issue there can be no question of taking symbolical possession in the sense understood by judicial decisions under the code of civil procedure what the act contemplates as a necessary condition of vesting of the land in the < org > is the taking of actual possession of the land how such possession may be taken would depend on the nature of the land there can be no hard and fast rule laying down what act would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land we
206	should not therefore be taken as laying down an absolute and inviolable rule that merely going on the spot and making a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land in every case but here in our opinion since the land was lying fallow and there was no crop on it at the material time the act of the tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and determining its extent was sufficient to constitute taking of possession it appears that the appellant was not present when this was done by the tehsildar but the presence of the owner or the occupant of the land is not necessary to effectuate the taking of possession it is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or the occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time though it may be desirable where possible to give such notice before possession is taken by the authorities as that would eliminate the possibility of any fraudulent or collusive transaction of taking of mere paper possession without the occupant or the owner ever coming to know of it the question as to whether actual physical possession had been taken in compliance of the provisions of section of the act or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case even in the said certificate of possession it had not been stated that there were standing crops on the land on the date on which possession was taken another striking feature of the case is that all the actions had been taken in a comprehensive manner the collector in his certificate of possession dated th november stated that the possession had been taken over in respect of the entire land the details of the land and the area thereof had also been mentioned in the certificate of possession even < org > in its letter dated th february stated that possession had not been delivered only in respect of land situated in four villages mentioned therein it is difficult to comprehend that if the < org > had paid of the total compensation as provided for under sub section a of section of the act out of acres of land it had obtained possession only in respect of about acres of land and still for such a long time it kept mum it is clearly implicit in the observations that after possession has been taken pursuant to a notification under section the land is vested in the < org > and the notification cannot be cancelled under section of the general clauses act nor can the notification be withdrawn in exercise of the powers under section of the land acquisition act
207	any other view would enable the state < org > to circumvent the specific provision by relying upon a general power when possession of the land is taken under section the land vests in the < org > there is no provision by which land statutorily vested in the < org > reverts to the original owner by mere cancellation of the notification in the context of applicablility of section a of the act it was stated when section is applied by reason of urgency < org > takes possession of the land prior to the making of the award under section and thereupon the owner is divested of the title to the land which is vested in the < org > section states so in unmistakable terms clearly section a can have no application to cases of acquisitions under section because the lands have already vested in the < org > and there is no provision in the said act by which land statutorily vested in the < org > can revert to the owner just as publication of a notification under section vests the land in the < org > free from all encumbrances as provided by section similarly when possession of land is taken under section the land vests absolutely in the < org > free from all encumbrances a question arose before this court that if there is a non compliance with the provisions of section a and an award is not made in respect to the land so acquired would the acquisition proceedings lapse this court held that once possession had been taken under section and the land vested in the < org > then the < org > could not withdraw from acquisition under section and the provisions of section a were not attracted and therefore the acquisition proceedings would not lapse on failure to make an award within the period prescribed therein it was further held that non compliance of section a regarding part payment of compensation before taking possession would also not render the possession illegal and entitle the < org > to withdraw from acquisition in view of the aforesaid ratio it follows that the provisions of section a are not attracted in the present case and even if it be assumed that the award has not been passed within the stipulated period the acquisition of land does not come to an end the question arose whether notification under section and the declaration under section get lapsed if the award is not made within two years as envisaged under section a a bench of three judges had held that once possession was taken and the land vested in the < org > title to the land so vested in the state is subject only to determination of compensation and to pay the same to the owner only section gives power
208	to withdraw from acquisition that too before possession is taken that question did not arise in this case the property under acquisition having been vested in the appellants in the absence of any power under the act to have the title of the appellants divested except by exercise of the power under section valid title cannot be defeated the exercise of the power to quash the notification under section and the declaration under section would lead to incongruity this < org > has categorically laid down that when the accepted mode of taking possession of the acquired land is resorted to that would constitute taking possession of the land in our considered view < org > has erred in holding that < org > could release the lands in exercise of its power under section of the land acquisition act from the acquisition the possession of the land in question was taken in the year after the passing of the award by the land acquisition officer thereafter the land vested in the < org > which was then transferred to < org > predecessor in interest of the appellant after the vesting of the land and taking possession thereof the notification for acquiring the land could not be withdrawn or cancelled in exercise of powers under section of the land acquisition act power under section of the general clauses act cannot be exercised after vesting of the land statutorily in the state < org > we may now consider the question as to whether the issue as to whether possession of the acquired land had actually been taken over or not being a disputed question of fact could not have gone into by < org > there is no law that < org > is denied or debarred from entering into a disputed question of fact if a disputed question can be determined on the basis of the documents and or affidavit < org > may not ordinarily refuse to do so < org > observed that they will not determine disputed question of fact in a writ petition but what facts were in dispute and what were admitted could only be determined after an affidavit in reply was filed by the state < org > is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under article merely because in considering the petitioner right to relief questions of fact may fall to be determined in a petition under article < org > has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law exercise of the jurisdiction is it is true discretionary but the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles when the petition raises questions of fact of a complex nature which may for their determination require oral evidence to be taken and on that account < org > is of the view that the dispute may not appropriately be tried in a writ
209	petition < org > may decline to try a petition rejection of a petition in limine will normally be justified where < org > is of the view that the petition is frivolous or because of the nature of the claim made dispute sought to be agitated or that the petition against the party against whom relief is claimed is not maintainable or that the dispute raised thereby is such that it would be in appropriate to try it in the writ jurisdiction or for anologous reasons from the averments made in the petition filed by the appellants it is clear that in proof of a large number of allegations the appellants relied upon documentary evidence and the only matter in respect of which conflict of facts may possibly arise related to the due publication of the notification under section by the collector in the present case in our judgment < org > was not justified in dismissing the petition on the ground that it will not determine disputed question of fact < org > has jurisdiction to determine questions of fact even if they are in dispute and the present in our judgment is a case in which in the interests of both the parties < org > should have entertained the petition and called for an affidavit in reply from the respondents and should have proceeded to try the petition instead of relegating the appellants to a separate suit it is not necessary for this case to express an opinion on the point as whether the various provisions of the code of civil procedure apply to petitions under article of the constitution section of the code to which reference has been made makes it clear that the provisions of the code in regard to suits shall be followed in all proceedings in any court of civil jurisdiction as far as it can be made applicable the words as far as it can be made applicable make it clear that in applying the various provisions of the code to proceedings other than those of a suit the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought power has consequently been vested in < org > to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any government within the jurisdiction of < org > orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari it is plain that if the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the case of writ petitions the entire purpose of having a quick and inexpensive remedy would be defeated < org > is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under article merely because in considering the petitioner right of relief questions of fact may fall to be determined in a petition under article < org > has
210	jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law exercise of the jurisdiction is no doubt discretionary but the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles if however on consideration of the nature of the controversy < org > decides as in the present case that it should go into a disputed question of fact and the discretion exercised by < org > appears to be sound and in conformity with judicial principles this court would not interfere in appeal with the order made by < org > in this respect no doubt shri < name > has contended that the appellant still retained their possession it is now well settled legal position that it is difficult to take physical possession of the land under compulsory acquisition the normal mode of taking possession is drafting the panchnama in the presence of panchas and taking possession and giving delivery to the beneficiaries is the accepted mode of taking possession of the land subsequent thereto the retention of possession would tantamount only to illegal or unlawful possession on the facts pleaded it is doubtful whether the government can withdraw from the acquisition since the case of the < org > and < org > is that possession has been taken and plans finalised to fulfil the purpose for which the acquisition was made there is no plea in the writ petition that a request for reconveyance was made in terms of section of the act as amended in the < org > of tamil nadu we may also notice that once a piece of land has been duly acquired under the land acquisition act the land becomes the property of the < org > the < org > can dispose of the property thereafter or convey it to anyone if the land is not needed for the purpose for which it was acquired only for the market value that may be fetched for the property as on the date of conveyance the doctrine of public trust would disable the < org > from giving back the property for anything less than the market value it is settled law that if the land is acquired for a public purpose after the public purpose was achieved the rest of the land could be used for any other public purpose in case there is no other public purpose for which the land is needed then instead of disposal by way of sale to the erstwhile owner the land should be put to public auction and the amount fetched in the public auction can be better utilised for the public purpose envisaged in the directive principles of the constitution otherwise the land of the < org > should be sold only through the public auctions so that the public also gets benefited by getting a higher value mr < name > however made an alternative submission before us that
211	this < org > in exercise of its jurisdiction under article of constitution of india may issue necessary directions so as to put a quietus to the entire matter however before us mr < name > learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents when questioned categorically stated that in view of the statement made in the counter affidavit the positive case of the respondents is that they had not been in possession if the aforementioned statement made by the respondents is found to be incorrect legal steps as is permissible in law may be taken if the land was not used for the purpose for which it was acquired it was open to < org > to take action but that did not confer any right on the respondents to ask for restitution of the land in our view there arises no question of any unjust enrichment to the appellant company it is not as if lands acquired for a particular public purpose cannot be utilised for another public purpose he contended that as long as the acquisition is not held to be mala fide the acquisition cannot be invalidated merely because the lands which at one time were proposed to be utilised for a particular public purpose were later either in whole or in part utilised for some other purpose though a public purpose he therefore submitted that some change of user of the land as long as it has a public purpose would not invalidate the acquisition proceeding which is otherwise valid and legal referring to the facts of the instant case it cannot be disputed that the planned development of delhi for which purpose the land was acquired under section of the act is wide enough to include the development and expansion of an airport within the city of delhi thus it cannot be said that the land is actually being utilised for any purpose other than that for which it was acquired the only difference is that whereas initially the development work would have been undertaken by < org > or any other agency employed by it after the constitution of < org > the said development work had to be undertaken by the newly constituted authority all that has happened is that the development work is undertaken by another agency since constituted which is entrusted with the special task of maintenance of airports since the said authority was constituted several years after the issuance of the notification under section the acquisition cannot be invalidated only on the ground that the public purpose is sought to be achieved through another agency this as we have noticed earlier was necessitated by change of circumstances in view of the creation of the authority i < org > moreover since there is no change of public purpose for which the acquired land is being utilised the acquisition cannot be invalidated on that ground therefore
212	the acquisition cannot be challenged on the ground that the acquired lands are not being utilised for the declared public purpose having regard to the facts of the case it cannot be contended nor has it been contended that the notification under section of the act was issued mala fide counsel fee assessed at rs in each of these appeals [SEP]
213	[CLS] order per < name > this appeal by the assessee for assessment year is directed against the order dated passed under section of the income tax act by < org > patiala brief facts of the case are these the assessee is an individual who had income for two months from to as proprietor of < org > dealing in manufacture and sale of poultry feeds the assessee also started a proprietary business in the name of < org > jagraon which ran for two months for february and march there was an income tax search at the premises of the assessee on when certain books of accounts and documents were taken into possession by the < org > commissioner accordingly issued a show cause notice dated listing as many as nine items which were not considered by the assessing officer at the time of original assessment commissioner after enumerating the nine items mentioned the show cause notice in the body of the order passed under section of the act took cognizance of the reply submitted by the assessee but he < name > that it was neither proper nor possible for him to verify the explanation furnished by the assessees learned counsel it is against this order that the assessee has come up in appeal before us counsel in fact drew our attention to the various notices issued by the assessing officer before completing the assessment to which a reference had been made above it was also submitted that the order under section was a quasi judicial order and it was necessary for assuming jurisdiction that there should be a proper and valid reason for doing so and the conclusion of the ld commissioner had not gone into the explanation furnished by the assessee nor had he come to a definite conclusion that the order passed by the < org > was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue as regards item no vii it was submitted that the assessee in his detailed reply before the commissioner had pointed out that < org > was incorporated on and that no income was earned up to when the assessee resigned from directorship it was pointed out that in the reply submitted it had been explained that the proprietary concern was proposed to be converted into a partnership concern for which purpose a partnership deed dated was also executed but this remained a paper transaction only and no activity was done by the partnership concern it was also pointed out that neither any investment was made nor did the firm actually come into existence as regard item no ix it was submitted that all the incriminating documents had been gone into by the ito and that the search took place as a result of the machination of a disgrunt
214	##led and dismissed employee of the assessee < name > counsel for the assessee therefore vehemently argued that there was absolutely no justification for assuming jurisdiction under section by the ld cit nor for passing the order setting aside the assessment to be made afresh itr for the proposition that the power of revision by the commissioner under section of the act is quasi judicial in character and he must give reasons in support of his conclusion that the assessment order is erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue if he does not give reasons the order would stand vitiated writing an order in detail may be legal requirement but the order not fulfilling this requirement cannot be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue we have carefully considered the submission of both the sides we find considerable merit in the arguments of < name > which have been put forth in a very clear cut manner we find that the assessment order framed by the assessing officer was passed under section after making all the necessary enquiries in the instant case what we find is that the < org > commissioner has neither looked into the submissions made on behalf of the assessee nor came to a firm conclusion that the assessment order was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue the case law cited by the assessee and referred to above makes it abundantly clear that the < org > commissioner must state the reasons for intervention before assuming jurisdiction under section and while passing the order under section must come to a conclusion that the order passed by the assessing officer was not only erroneous but also prejudicial to the interests of the revenue in the case of < org > supra the facts were more or less similar to what we find in the instant case the < org > commissioner intervened under section of the act and set aside the order of assessment with a direction to make fresh assessment on the ground that business loss of the assessee amounting to rs < org > he < org > that the commissioner did not furnish his opinion or consider the cited cases or the arguments raised and merely observed that these were the points which deserved consideration and after setting aside the order of the < org > assessing officer issued a direction for making assessment afresh which was not permissible under the provisions contained in section of the act in the present case also the commissioner has not come to a firm conclusion as to how the order passed by the assessing officer was erroneous the assessee had all furnished a cogent reply before the < org > commissioner when a show cause notice issued under section was issued in the face of

216	[CLS] in view of the finding as to the nature of the discharge set up by the st defendant the only question is whether there is any objection to a suit by the plaintiff for his share in the circumstances of the case i think there is no objection the petition is dismissed with costs that being so the only question is whether the plaintiff suit for his share of the debt can be sustained he having made his co partners defendants in the action no doubt the general rule is that one partner can give a valid discharge of a debt due to his partnership but that rule has no application if the discharge so given is in fraud of the aggrieved partner and is the result of collusion between the partner giving a discharge and the debtor this petition must be dismissed with costs [SEP]
217	[CLS] the state of maharashtra is not prepared to reconcile with the clean chit granted to him by < org > and hence this appeal by special leave has been filed by the state the life of < name > was snuffed off on as per the prosecution version the accused who is respondent in this appeal was already an accused in another case facing ah allegation that he committed rape and murder of one eight year old female child by name < name > after such release from jail respondent visited < name > house and subsequently he paid frequent visits to the said house on respondent went to that house and when he was told that < name > had gone out he left the house there were number of contusions and abrasions on her face also the sessions judge found that all those circumstances were established and they formed themselves into a completed chain unerringly pointing to the guilt of the respondent the circumstances which prosecution presented can be recast as follows respondent visited the house of < name > at about and after he left the house it was realised that < name > also disappeared pw mahadeo saw the accused and a female child together in his shop at about on the same days pw motiram saw them together in his shop at about a little later pw sayyed niyamat saw them walking along the road respondent after his arrest disclosed to pw pursuant thereto the spot was pointed out by the respondent wherefrom the dead body was recovered pw dr < name > stated that the person who caused the injuries on the vagina of the deceased child would have sustained injuries on his male organ < org > sidestepped the circumstance that semen and blood were detected on the under clothes of the accused on the premise that there was delay in seizing those wearing apparels in a test identification parade conducted by pw magistrate he identified the respondent as the person who accompanied the child < name > gave evidence that when he was returning from his friday namaz he saw a young man holding a crying girl around he too gave almost the same reason for remembering it that when he heard next day about the murder of a little girl he had some doubt whether it was the same crying girl so he informed the police about it he too was called in the test identification parade wherein he identified the respondent as the person whom he saw with the girl such a reasoning overlooks the broad aspect that a human mind on hearing about any shocking incident would have the tendency to recollect any previous event
218	which could have had a connection with that incident if as a matter of fact those witnesses had occasion to see a crying girl of that age on the very day of the gruesome episode as happened in this case there is nothing improbable in those witnesses remembering the person who was seen in the company of that girl if they had immediately informed the police that they noticed a similarly aged girl crying in the company of an utter stranger of that locality that cannot be brushed aside as a doubtful conduct they said that they went to the police station on whereas pw police inspector said that they visited me police station only on we do not attach any significance to the aforesaid discrepancy as pw should have been more correct because he was speaking with the help of investigation records while the witnesses would have spoken from their memory only it is not for the < org > to suggest that he should have divulged it to the members of the bereaved family despite his own thinking about it at any rate we are not impressed by the aforesaid reasoning for rejecting the testimony of an important witness like pw for considering that reasoning it must be remembered that < name > would certainly have been abducted by some body even assuming that it was not this respondent and that person had taken the abducted girl from her house up to the farm unless it is suggested that there was another alternative and safer route for the culprit to take the girl unnoticed by any shopkeeper or even a pedestrian there in no rationale in the reasoning that there is inherent incredibility in the version that respondent would have taken the girl through this route it contains the details of the steps adopted by him we remind ourselves that identification parades are not primarily meant for the court and the admissible portion of it reads thus her dead body is kept concealed in the field i will take it out and produce the same come with me the first limb of that reasoning was based on a mistake committed by pw < name > in his evidence when he said that he saw the dead body of the child on much strain is not required in holding that what pw said should have been understood as the second limb of the reasoning is that two other possibilities could not have been ruled out we have pointed out earlier the injuries which the doctor had noted on the person of the accused when he was examined on the significant impact of the said incriminating circumstance is that the accused could not give any explanation whatsoever for those injuries and therefore he had chosen to say that he did not sustain any such injury
219	at all we have no reason to disbelieve the testimony of pw dr < name > false answer offered by the accused when his attention was drawn to the aforesaid circumstance renders that circumstance capable of inculpating him in a situation like this such a false answer can also be counted as providing a missing link for completing the chain it is disconcerting that a case like his in which the prosecution has presented such reliable and formidable circumstances forming into a completed chain and pointing unerringly to me irresistible conclusion mat the little girl < name > was raped and killed by none other than the respondent himself ended in unmerited acquittal from < org > of < org > unfortunately became a casualty in this case when the high curt side stepped all such circumstances and exonerated the culprit of such a grotesque crime we therefore set aside the impugned judgment and restore the conviction passed by the trial court however the lesser option is not unquestionably foreclosed and so we alter the sentence in regard to the offence under section to imprisonment for life the sentences imposed by the trial court on all other counts would remain unaltered we direct the respondent to surrender to bail we also direct the sessions judge < name > to take immediate and necessary steps to put the accused in jail if he is not already in jail for undergoing the sentence imposed on him [SEP]

221	far as the appellant was concerned it had already been granted exemption from sales tax and < org > stood committed to it < org > however went back upon the assurance and a letter dated th january was addressed by the th respondent intimating that the < org > had taken a policy decision that new < org > units in the state which go into commercial production by th september would be given only partial concession in sales tax at different rates on each year of production the factory of the appellant thereafter went into production from nd july and the appellant informed the secretary to the < org > about the same by its letter dated rd july the appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in < org > asking for a writ directing < org > to exempt the sales of < org > manufactured by the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years commencing from nd january by issuing a notification under section a of the sales tax act from the appellant for the said period of three years the view taken by < org > namely that even if there was an assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of < org > and such assurance was binding on < org > on the principle of promissory estoppel the appellant had waived its right under it by a accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set out in the letter of the th respondent dated th january is not correct no plea of waiver can be allowed to be raised unless it is pleaded and the factual foundation for it is laid in the pleadings in the instant case a the plea of waiver was not taken by < org > in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to the writ petition nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit it was not right for < org > to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea should have been rejected in limine if waiver were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated th june and establishing that on those facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent but in the absence of such pleading in the affidavit in reply this opportunity was denied to the appellant a in the instant case on the facts the plea of waiver could not be said to have been made out by < org > there was nothing to state that at the date when the appellant addressed the letter
222	dated th june it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right it is not possible to presume in the absence of any material placed before the < org > that the appellant had full knowledge of its right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing the letter dated th june it is difficult to speculate what was the reason why the appellant addressed the letter th june stating that it would avail of the concessional rates of sales tax granted under the letter dated th january the doctrine called promissory estoppel equitable estoppel quasi estoppel and new estoppel is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice where a promise is made by a person knowing that it would be acted on and it is person to whom it is made and in fact it is so acted on and it is inequitable to allow the party making the promise to go back upon it the true principle of promissory estoppel is that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relationship effect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is infact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any pre existing relationship between the parties or not equity will in a given case where justice and fairness demand prevent a person from insisting on strict legal rights even where they arise not under any contract but on his own title deeds or under statute the parties need not be in any kind of legal relationship before the transaction from which the promissory estoppel take its origin the doctrine would apply even where there is no pre existing legal relationship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship whish will arise in future all ca quoted with approval it is an equitable principle evolved by the < org > s for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence and it should only be a shield and not a sword to found a cause of action there is no qualitative difference between proprietary estoppel and promissory estoppel both are the off springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit proprietary
223	estoppel to be used as a cause of action there is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as cause of action if necessary to satisfy the equity therefore despite the fact that allowing promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation this new principle which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should not be held in fetters but allowed to operate in all its activist magnitude so that it may fulfil the purpose for which was conceived and born a promise may in the united states derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor knowing or intending that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in english and < org > jurisprudence under the english law the judicially formed view is that the crown is not immune from liability under the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the view taken by < name > in that the crown cannot escape its obligation under the doctrine of promissory estoppel by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity still holds the field the < org > would not be estopped by the acts of its officers and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit and these dealing with an agent of the < org > must be held to have notice of limitations of his authority where the < org > makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promisee and in fact the promisee acting in reliance on it alters his position the < org > would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the < org > at the instance of the promisee notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by article of the constitution the < org > cannot be heard to say that it is under no obligation to act in a manner that is fair and just or that it is not bound by considerations of honesty and good faith therefore it is not open to < org > to claim immunity from the applicability of the rule of promissory estopped and thereby repudiate a promise made by it on the ground that such promise may fetter its future executive action the doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because on the facts equity
224	would not require that the < org > should be held bound by the promise made by it a when the < org > is able to show that in view of the facts as they have transpired public interest would be prejudiced if the < org > were required to carry out the promise the < org > would have to balance the public interest in the < org > carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the < org > and determine which way the equity lies it would not be enough for the < org > just to say that public interest requires that the < org > should not be compelled to carry out the promise or that the public interest would suffer if the < org > were required to honour it a in order to resist its liability the < org > should disclose to the < org > the various events necessitating its claim to be exempt from the liability and it would be for the < org > to decide whether those events are such as to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the < org > it is only if the < org > is satisfied on proper and adequate material placed by the < org > that over riding public interest requires that the < org > should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it that the < org > would refuse to enforce the promise against the < org > but even where there is no such over riding public interest it may still be competent to the < org > to resile from the promise on giving reasonable notice which need not be a formal notice giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity of resuming his position provided of course it is possible for the promisee to restore status quo ante however this doctrine cannot be applied in teeth of an obligation or liability imposed by law it cannot be invoked to compel the < org > or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law the < org > can never be precluded from exercising its legislative function by resort to the doctrine of pro missory estoppel in order to attract the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is not necessary that the promisee acting in reliance on the promise should suffer any deteriment if by deteriment is meant injustice to the promisee which would result if the promisor were to resile from his promisee the

226	steel foundry on th october a news item appeared in < org > in which it was stated that the state of uttar pradesh had decided to give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under section a of the sales tax act to all new industrial units in the state with a view to enabling them to come on firm footing in developing stage the appellant on the basis of this announcement addressed a letter dated th october to the director of industries stating that in view of the sales tax holiday announced by the < org > the appellant intended to set up a hydro genation plant for manufacture of < org > and sought for confirmation that this industrial unit which it proposed to set up would be entitled to sales tax holiday for a period of three years from the date it commenced production on th december the appellant representative met the th respondent who was at that time the chief secretary to the < org > as also advisor to the governor and intimated to him that the appellant was setting up the < org > factory solely on the basis of the assurance given on behalf of the < org > that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of commercial production at the factory and the th respondent reiterated the assurance that the appellant would be entitled to sales tax holiday in case the < org > factory was put up by it the appellant by its letter dated th december placed on record what had transpired at the meeting on the previous day and requested the th respondent to please confirm that we shall be allowed sales tax holiday for a period of three years on the sale of < org > from the date we start production on the same day the appellant entered into an agreement with < org > bombay for supply of plant and machinery for the < org > factory providing clearly that the appellant would have the option to terminate the agreement if within weeks exemption from sales tax was not granted by < org > the appellant had in the meantime submitted an application dated st december for a formal order granting exemption from sales tax under section a of the act the appellant therefore addressed a letter dated nd january to the th respondent pointing out that the financial institutions were of the view that the letter of the th respondent dated nd december did not purport to commit the < org > for the concession mentioned and it was therefore necessary to obtain a formal order of exemption in terms of the application submitted by it the t
227	##h respondent however stated categorically in his letter in reply dated rd january that the proposed < org > factory of the appellant will be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of going into production and that this will apply to all < org > sold during that period in uttar pradesh itself and expressed his surprise that a letter from the chief secretary to < org > stating this fact in clear and unambiguous words should not carry conviction with the financial institutions the appellant by its letter dated th april advised the th respondent that < org > being convinced by the clear and categorical assurance given by the th respondent that the < org > factory of the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production had sanctioned financial assistance to the appellant and the appellant was going ahead with the project in full speed to enable it to start production at the earliest the appellant made considerable progress in the setting up of the < org > factory but it seems that by the middle of may < org > started having second thoughts on the question of exemption and a letter dated may was addressed by the th respondent who was deputy secretary to the < org > in < org > intimating that a meeting has been called by the chief minister on rd may to discuss the question of giving concession in sales tax on < org > products and requesting the appellant to attend the meeting the appellant immediately by its letter dated th may pointed out to the th respondent that so far as the appellant was concerned < org > had already granted exemption from sales tax by the letter of the chief secretary dated rd january but still the appellant would be glad to send its representative to attend the meeting as desired by the th respondent the appellant representative attended the meeting on that day and reiterated that so far as the appellant was concerned it had already been granted exemption from sales tax and < org > stood committed to it the appellant thereafter proceeded with the work of setting up the < org > plant on the basis that in accordance with the assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of < org > the appellant would be exempt from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production < org > however went back upon this assurance and a letter dated th january was addressed by the th respondent intimating that the government had taken a policy decision that new
228	vanaspati units in the state which go into commercial production by th september would be given partial concession in sales tax at the following rates for a period of three years first year of production second year of production third year of production the appellant by its letter dated th june pointed out to the secretary to the government that the appellant proposed to start commercial production of < org > with effect from st july and stated that as notified in the letter dated th january the appellant would be availing of the exemption granted by < org > and would be charging sales tax at the rate of instead of on the sales of < org > manufactured by it for a period of one year commencing from st july the factory of the appellant thereafter went into production from nd july and the appellant informed the secretary to the government about the same by its letter dated rd july the appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in < org > asking for a writ directing < org > to exempt the sales of < org > manufactured by the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years commencing from nd july by issuing a notification under section a and not to collect or charge sales tax from the appellant for the said period of three years it appears that in the writ petition as originally filed there was no plea of promissory estoppel taken against < org > and the writ petition was therefore amended by obtaining leave of < org > with a view to introducing the plea of promissory estoppel the appellant urged in the amended writ petition that the th respondent acting on behalf of < org > had given an unequivocal assurance to the appellant that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production and this assurance was given by the th respondent intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant acting in reliance on it established the < org > factory by investing a large amount and < org > was therefore bound to honour the assurance and exempt the < org > manufactured and sold by the appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from nd july the appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal after obtaining a certificate of fitness from < org > the principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the th respondent had given a categorical assurance on behalf of < org > that the appellant would be exempt from payment of sales tax for a period
229	of three years from the date of commencement of production and such assurance was given intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant acting in reliance on it altered its position and < org > was therefore bound on the principle of promissory estoppel to honour the assurance and exempt the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years from nd july being the date on which the factory of the appellant commenced production the appellant urged that waiver was a question of fact which was required to be pleaded and since no plea of waiver was raised in the affidavit filed on behalf of < org > in opposition to the writ petition it was not competent to < org > to rely on the plea of waiver for the first time at the hearing of the writ petition even if the plea of waiver were allowed to be raised notwithstanding that it did not find place in the pleadings no waiver was made out said the appellant since there was nothing to show that were the circumstances in which the appellant had addressed the letter dated th june stating that it would avail of the exemption granted under the letter dated th january and it was not possible to say that the appellant with full knowledge of its right to claim total exemption from payment of sales tax waived that right and agreed to accept the concessional rates set out in the letter dated th january < org > on the other hand strongly pressed the plea of waiver and submitted that the appellant had clearly waived its right to complete exemption from payment of sales tax by addressing the letter dated th june < org > also contended that in any event even if there was no waiver the appellant was not entitled to enforce the assurance given by the th respondent since such assurance was not binding on < org > and more over in the absence of notification under section a < org > could not be prevented from enforcing the liability to sales tax imposed on the appellant under the provisions of the act it was urged on behalf of < org > that there could be no promissory estoppel against < org > so as to inhibit it from formulating and implementing its policies in public interest these were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to consider them we shall first deal with the question of waiver since that can be disposed of in a few words < org > held that even if there was an assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of < org > and such assurance was binding on < org > on the principle of promissory estoppel the appellant had waived
230	its right under it by accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set out in the letter of the th respondent dated th january no plea of waiver can be allowed to be raised unless it is pleaded and the factual foundation for it is laid in the pleadings here it was common ground that the plea of waiver was not taken by < org > in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to the writ petition nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit if waiver were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated th june and establishing that on these facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent but in the absence of such pleading in the affidavit in reply this opportunity was denied to the appellant it was therefore not right for < org > to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea should have been rejected in limine it is pointed out in halsbury laws of england volume in paragraph at page that for a waiver to be effectual it is essential that the person granting it should be fully informed as to his rights and < name > delivering the judgment of < org > in < name > < org > has also emphasised that waiver must be with knowledge an essential supported by many authorities now in the present case there is nothing to show that at the date when the appellant addressed the letter dated th june it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right it is difficult to speculate what was the reason why the appellant addressed the letter dated th june stating that it would avail of the concessional rates of sales tax granted under the letter dated th january it is possible that the appellant might have thought that since no notification exempting the appellant from sales tax had been issued by < org > under section a the appellant was legally not entitled to exemption and that is why the appellant might have chosen to accept whatever concession was being granted by < org > the claim of the appellant to exemption could be sustained only on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and this doctrine could not be said to be so well defined in its scope and ambit and so free from uncertainty in its application that we should be compelled to hold that the appellant must have had knowledge of its right to exemption on the basis of promissory estoppel at the time when it addressed the
231	letter dated th june in fact in the petition as originally filed the right to claim total exemption from sales tax was not based on the plea of promissory estoppel which was introduced only by way of amendment moreover it must be remembered that there is no presumption that every person knows the law it is often said that every one is presumed to know the law but that is not a correct statement there is no such maxim known to the law over a hundred and thirty years ago < name > pointed out in < name > < name > there is no presumption in this country that every person knows the law it would be contrary to common sense and reason if it were so there is the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse a maxim of very different scope and application it is therefore not possible to presume in the absence of any material placed before the < org > that the appellant had full knowledge of its right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing the letter dated th june we accordingly reject the plea of waiver raised on behalf of < org > that takes us to the question whether the assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of < org > that the appellant would be exempt from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production could be enforced against < org > by invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice and though commonly named promissory estoppel it is as we shall presently point out neither in the realm of contract nor in the realm of estoppel it is interesting to trace the evolution of this doctrine in england and to refer to some of the english decisions in order to appreciate the true scope and ambit of the doctrine particularly because it has been the subject of considerable recent development and is steadily expanding lord < name > stated the doctrine in its earliest form it has undergone considerable development since then in the following words in < name > < org > supra it is the first principle upon which all courts of equity proceed that if parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal results afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or held in abeyance the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which
232	have thus taken place between the parties this principle of equity laid down by lord < name > made sporadic appearances in stray cases now and then but it was only in that it was disinterred and restated as a recognised doctrine by mr justice < name > as he then was in the high trees case supra the facts in that case were as follows the plaintiffs leased to the defendents a subsidiary of the plaintiffs in a block of flats for years at a rent of a year the plaintiffs agreed at the request of the defendants to reduce the rent to the claim was allowed because the court took the view that the period for which the full rent was claimed fell out side the representation but mr justice < name > as he then was considered < name > whether the plaintiffs could have recovered the covenanted rent for the whole period of the lease and observed that in equity the plaintiffs could not have been allowed to act inconsistently with their promise on which the defendants had acted it was pressed upon the < org > that according to the well settled law as laid down in jorden money no estoppel could be raised against plaintiffs since the doctrine of estoppel by representation is applicable only to representations as to some state of facts alleged to be at the time actually in existence and not to promises de futuro which if binding at all must be binding only as contracts and here there was no representa tion of an existing state of facts by the plaintiffs but it was merely a promise or representation of intention to act in a particular manner in the future they are cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which to the knowledge of the person making the promise was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on ten years later < org > also used the same terminology in < org > < org > and < org > supra that if persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct those against whom they have such rights to believe in fact < name > < name > pointed out in < org > < org > lord < name > in his enunciation of the principle assumed a pre existing contractual relationship between the parties but this does not seem to me to be essential provided that there is a pre existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties but even this limitation suggested by < name > < name > that there should be a pre existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties is not warranted
233	and it is significant that the statement of the doctrine by mr justice < name > in the high trees case does not contain any such limitation the learned judge has consistently refused to introduce any such limitation in the doctrine and while sitting in < org > he said in so many terms in < name > < org > counsel for the appellant referred us however to the second edition of < name > book on estoppel by representation pp i do not think it is so limited see < org > < org > it applies whenever a representation is made whether of fact or law present or future which is intended to be binding intended to induce a person to act on it and he does act on it this observation of lord < name > clearly suggest that the parties need not be in any kind of legal relationship before the transaction from which the promissory estoppel takes its origin the doctrine would seem to apply even where there is no pre existing legal relationship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship which will arise in future of course it must be pointed out in fairness to lord < name > that he made it clear in the high trees case that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot found a cause of action in itself since it can never do away with the necessity of consideration in the formation of a contract but he totally repudiated in < name > case the necessity of a pre existing relationship between the parties and pointed out in < name > arun district council that equity will in a given case where justice and fairness demand prevent a person from insisting on strict legal rights even where they arise not under any contract but on his own title deeds or under statue the true principle of promissory estoppel therefore seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any preexisting relationship between the parties or not it may be pointed out that in england the law has been well settled for a long time though there is some indication of a contrary trend to be found in recent jurist
234	##ic thinking in that country that promissory estoppel cannot itself be the basis of an action the ghost of traditional estoppel continues to haunt this new doctrine and that is why we find that while boldly formulating and applying this new equity in the high trees case lord < name > added a qualification that though in the circumstances set out the promise would undoubtedly be held by the courts to be binding on the party making it notwithstanding that under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it the courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it that principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before it only prevents a party from insisting upon his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties so also said < name > in the more recent case of < name > < org > the doctrine may afford a defence against the enforcement or otherwise of enforceable rights it cannot create a cause of action it is however necessary to make it clear that though this doctrine has been called in various judgments and text books as promissory estoppel and it has been variously described as equitable estoppel quasi estoppel and new estoppel it is not really based on the principle of estoppel but it is a doctrine evolved by equity in order to prevent injustice where a promise is made by a person knowing that it would be acted on by the person to whom it is made and in fact it is so acted on and it is inequitable to allow the party making the promise to go back upon it they are really promises promises intended to be binding intended to be acted upon and in fact acted upon it is an equitable principle evolved by the courts for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence it may be noted that even lord < name > recognised in < name > arun distric council supra that there are estoppels and estoppels some don and added that in the species of estoppel called proprietary estoppel it does give rise to a cause of action the learned law lord after quoting what he had said in < org > twitchings namely that the effect of estoppel on the true owner may be that his own title to the property be it land or goods has been held to be limited or extinguished and new rights and interests have been created therein proceeded
235	to observe that the new rights and interests so created by estoppel in or over land will be protected by the courts and in this way give rise to a cause of action but if we look at the judgments of lord < name > and < name > < name > it is apparent that they did not base their decision on any distinctive feature of proprietary estoppel but proceeded on the assumption that there was no distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel so far as the problem before them was concerned lord < name > referring to what lord < name > had said in < name > < org > a decision from which inspiration was drawn by him for evolving the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the high tree case observed that it is the first principle on which all courts of equity proceed that it will prevent person from insisting on his strict legal rights whether arising under a contract or on his title deeds or by statute when it would be inequitable for him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties < name > < name > also observed that in pursuing the inquiry as to whether there was an equity in favour of < name > he did not find helpful the distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel he added that this distinction may indeed be valuable to those who have to teach or expound the law but i do not think that in solving the particular problem raised by a particular case putting the law into categories is of the slightest assistance the representative of < org > clearly gave assurance to < name > that they would give him access to the new road at point to serve the southern portion of his land and < org > in fact constructed a gate at point and in the belief induced by this representation that he would have right of access to the new road at point < name > agreed to sell the northern portion of his land without reserving for himself as owner of the southern portion any right of way over the northern portion for the purpose of access to the new road this was the reason why the court raised an equity in favour of < name > and held that the equity would be satisfied by giving < name > the right of access at point free of charge without paying anything for it < org > was held bound by its promise to provide < name > access to the new road at point and this promise was enforced against < org > at the instance of < name > the case was one which fell within the category of promissory estoppel and it may be regarded as supporting the view that promissory estoppel can be the basis
236	of a cause of action it is possible that the case also came within the rule of proprietary estoppel enunciated by lord < name > in < name > dyson the rule of law applicable to the case appears to me to be this if a man under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land or what amounts to the same thing under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord and upon the faith of such promise or expectation with the knowledge of the land lord and without objection by him lays out money upon the land < org > will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation and < name > and < name > may be right in observing that that was perhaps the reason why it was held that the promise made by arun district council gave rise to a cause of action in favour of < name > if proprietary estoppel can furnish a cause of action why should promissory estoppel not there is no qualitative difference between the two both are the off springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action there is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as a cause of action if necessary to satisfy the equity the learned authors have also observed at page that to give a plaintiff a cause of action on a promissory estoppel must be little less than to allow an action in contract where consideration is not shown and that cannot be done because consideration still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract it can hardly be disputed that over the last three or four centuries the doctrine of consideration has come to occupy such a predominant position in the law of contract that under the english law it is impossible to think of a contract without consideration and therefore it is understandable that the english courts should have hesitated to push the doctrine of promissory estoppel to its logical conclusion and stopped short at allowing it to be used merely as a weapon of defence though as we shall point out there are quite a few cases where this doctrine has been used not as founding a cause of action in itself but as a part of a cause of a action the modern attitude towards the doctrine of consideration is however changing fast and there is considerable body of juristic thought which believes that this doctrine is something of an anchronism < name > pointed out long ago in his history of english law that the requirements of consideration in its present shape prevent the enforcement of many contracts which ought to be enforced if the
237	law really wishes to give effect to the lawful intentions of the parties to them and it would prevent the enforcement of many others if the judges had not used their ingenuity to invest considerations lord < name > observed in the well known case of < org > < org > i confess that this case is to my mind apt to nip any budding affection which one might have had for the doctrine of consideration for the effect of that doctrine in the present case is to make it possible for a person to snap his fingers at a bargain deliberately made a bargain not in itself unfair and which the person seeking to enforce it has a legitimate interest to enforce we do not see any valid reason why promissory estoppel should not be allowed to found a cause of action where in order to satisfy the equity it is necessary to do so two such cases are < name > minister of pensions and < name > < org > the english courts have thus gone a step forward from the original position when promissory estoppel was regarded merely as a passive equity and allowed it to be used as a weapon of offence to a limited extent as a part of the cause of action but still the doctrine of consideration continues to inhibit the judicial mind and that has thwarted the full development of this new equitable principle and the realisation of its vast potential as a juristic technique for doing justice it is true that to allow promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation but that is no reason why this new principle which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should be held in fetters and not allowed to operate in all the activist magnitude so that it may fulfil the purpose for which it was conceived and born we would do well to recall the famous words uttered by mr justice < name > while closing his first lecture on paradoxes of legal science the disparity between precedent and ethos may so lengthen with the years that only covin and chicenery would be disappointed if the separation were to end there are many intermediate stages mores if inadequate to obliterate the past may fix direction for the future < name > < org > we may profitably consider at this stage what the american law on the subject is because in the united states the law has always shown a greater capacity for adjustment and growth than elsewhere it is true that the restatement has not the same weight as a source of law
238	as actual decisions of courts of high standing yet the principle set out in article has in fact formed the basis of a number of decisions in various states and it is now becoming increasingly clear that a promise may in the united states derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor intending that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in english and commonwealth jurisprudence there are numerous examples of the application of this principle to be found in recent american decisions there is for instance the long line of cases in which a promise to give a charitable subscription has been consistently held to be enforceable at the suit of the charity we held the promise binding though consideration there was none except upon the theory of a promissory estoppel decisions which have stood so long and which are supported by so many considerations of public policy and reason will not be over ruled to save the symmetry of a concept which itself came into our law not so much from any reasoned conviction of its justice as from historical accidents of practice and procedure the most notable instances are to be found in what may be called the sub contractor bid cases in which a contractor about to tender for a contract invites a sub contractor to submit a bid for a sub contract and after receiving his bid the contractor submits a tender it is not possible to say that any detriment which the contractor may be able to show in these cases would amount to consideration in its strict sense and these decisions have plainly been reached on an application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel there are also numerous cases where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the government where the interest of justice morality and common fairness clearly dictated such a course we shall refer to these cases when we discuss the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the government suffice it to state for the present that the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been taken much further in the united states than in english and commonwealth jurisdictions and in some states at least it has been used to reduce if not to destroy the prestige of consideration as an essential of valid contract < name > in an early decision in < org > the king held that an undertaking given by < org > to certain neutral ship owners during the first world war that if the shipowners sent a particular ship to the united kingdom with a specified cargo she shall not be detained was not enforceable against < org > in a court of law and observed that his main reason for taking this
239	view was that it is not competent for the < org > to fetter its future executive action which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when the question arises it cannot by contract hamper its freedom of action in matters which concern the welfare of the < org > nor can the < org > escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity that is the doctrine that the < org > cannot bind itself so as to fetter its future executive action that doctrine was propounded by < name > in < org > the king but it was unnecessary for the decision because the statement there was not a promise which was intended to be binding but only an expression of intention it only avails the < org > where there is an implied term to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract the courts in america for a long time took the view that the doctrine of promissory estoppel does not apply to the < org > but more recently the courts have started retreating from that position to a sounder one namely that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may apply to the < org > when justice so requires later in the same paragraph it is stated that as a general rule the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the < org > in its governmental public or sovereign capacity but a qualification is introduced that promissory estoppel may be applied against the < org > even in its governmental public or sovereign capacity if its application is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice since there is an increasing trend towards applying the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the < org > and the old law that promissory estoppel does not apply against the government is definitely declining on winter wheat acreage was insurable and acting upon it the respondents made an application for insurance which was forwarded by < org > to the denver office of the < org > with a recommendation for acceptance there were at this time wheat crop insurance regulations framed by the < org > and published in < org > which prohibited insurance of spring wheat reseeded on winter wheat acreage but neither the respondents nor < org > s which was acting as the agent of the < org > was aware of them a few months later most of the respondent crop was destroyed by drought and on a claim being made by the respondents under the policy of insurance the < org > refused to pay the loss on the ground that the wheat crop insurance regulations expressly prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat the majority observed it is to

247	gained new dimensions in recent years a new class of estoppel i promissory estoppel has come to be recognised by the courts in this country as well as in england the learned judge after referring to the decisions in < org > case < name > minister of pensions supra and the indo afghan agencies case pointed out that the rule laid down in these decisions undoubtedly advanced the cause of justice and hence we have no hesitation in accepting it because that was a decision strongly relied upon on behalf of the < org > for negativing the applicability of the doctrine of estoppel against the < org > this was a case where the appellant was appointed to a temporary post and on the post being abolished the service of the appellant was terminated the appellant challenged the validity of termination of service inter alia on the ground that the < org > was precluded from abolishing the post and terminating the service on the principle of promissory estoppel at paragraph and observed that the high < org > rightly held that the courts exclude the operation of the doctrine of estoppel when it is found that the authority against whom estoppel is pleaded has owed a duty to the public against whom the estoppel cannot fairly operate it was this observation which was heavily relied upon on behalf of the < org > but we fail to see how it can assist the contention of the < org > in the first place this observation was clearly obiter since as pointed out by us there was on the facts of the present case no scope for the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel secondly this observation was based upon a quotation from the passage in paragraph at page of volume of american jurisprudence but unfortunately this quotation was incomplete and it overlooked perhaps inadvertently the following two important sentences at the commencement of the paragraph which clearly show that even in the united < org > s the doctrine of promissory estoppel is applied against the < org > when justified by the facts there is considerable dispute as to the application of estoppel with respect to the < org > even the truncated passage quoted by the < org > recognised in the last sentence that though as a general rule the doctrine of promissory estoppel would not be applied against the < org > in its governmental public or sovereign capacity the < org > would unhesitatingly allow the doctrine to be invoked in cases where it is necessary in order to prevent fraud or manifest injustice this proposition is unexceptionable because where the < org > owes a duty to the public to act in a particular manner and
248	here obviously duty means a course of conduct enjoined by law the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing the < org > from acting in discharge of its duty under the law the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be applied in teeth of an obligation or liability imposed by law it is not necessary to reproduce the facts of this case because the only purpose for which this decision was relied upon on behalf of the < org > was to show that the view taken by < org > in < name > < org > supra was preferred by this court to that taken by lord < name > in < name > minister of pension supra it is true that in this case the court expressed the opinion that the view taken by < org > is the correct one and not the one taken by lord < name > but we fail to see how that can possibly help the argument of the < org > the ratio of the decision was succinctly put by lord < name > when he said neither a minister nor any subordinate officer of the < org > can by any conduct or representation bar the < org > from enforcing a statutory prohibition or entitle the subject to maintain that there has been no breach of it it may also be noted that promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to compel the < org > or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law the < org > can never be precluded from exercising its legislative function by resort to the doctrine of promissory estoppel this was also a decision on which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the < org > in the first place it is clear that in this case there was factually no foundation for invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel when the < org > auctioned the licence for retail sale of country liquor and the respondents being the highest bidders were granted such licence there was in force a notification dated th april issued under section of the sales tax act exempting sale of country liquor from payment of sales tax no announcement was made at the time of the auction whether the exemption from sales tax under this notification dated th april was or was not likely to be withdrawn however on the day following the commencement of the licence granted to the respondents the < org > of issued a notification dated nd april superseding the earlier notification dated th april and imposing sales tax on the turnover in respect of country spirit with immediate effect this notification dated nd april was challenged by the respondents by filing a writ petition and amongst the several grounds of challenge taken in the writ petition one
249	was that since the < org > < org > did not announce at the time of the aforesaid auction that the notification dated th april was likely to be withdrawn and the sales of country liquor were likely to be subjected to the levy of sales tax during the excise year and in reply to the query made by them at the time of the auction they were told by the authorities that there was no sales tax on the sale of country liquor the appellants herein were estopped from making the demand in respect of sales tax and recovering the same from them it was in the context of this ground of challenge that the court came to make the observation relied upon on behalf of the < org > now it is clear that even taking the case of the respondents at its highest there was no representation or promise made by the < org > that they would continue the exemp tion from sales tax granted under the notification dated th april and would not withdraw it and the notification dated nd april could not therefore be assailed as being in breach of any such representation or promise there was accordingly no factual basis for making good the plea of promissory estoppel and the observation made by the court in regard to the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the < org > was clear obiter that perhaps was the reason why the < org > did not consider it necessary to refer to the earlier decisions in < org > case and < org > case and particularly the decision in the indo afghan agencies case where the court in so many terms applied the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the < org > in the exercise of its executive power this observation was made on the basis of certain decisions which the < org > proceeded to discuss in the succeeding paragraphs of the judgment the < org > first relied on the statement of the law contained in paragraph at page volume of the american jurisprudence but it omitted to mention the two important sentences at the commencement of the paragraph and the words unless its application is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice at the end which clearly show that even according to the american jurisprudence the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not wholly inapplicable against the < org > in its governmental public or sovereign capacity but it can be invoked against the < org > when justified by the facts as for example where it is necessary to prevent fraud or injustice in fact as already pointed out above there are numerous cases in the united states where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the < org > in the exercise
250	of its governmental public or executive powers the < org > then relied upon the decision in < org > case but that decision was confined to a case where legislation was sought to be precluded by relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and it was held and in our opinion rightly that there can be no promissory estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its legislative function but this passage itself makes it clear that the courts will bind the < org > by its promise where it is necessary to do so in order to prevent manifest injustice or fraud the last decision on which the < org > relied was < org > < name > supra but this decision also does not support the view contended for on behalf of the state we have already referred to this decision earlier and pointed out that the < org > in this case was held not liable on the policy of insurance because the regulations made by the < org > prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat it will thus be seen from the decisions relied upon in the judgment that the < org > could not possibly have intended to lay down an absolute proposition that there can be no promissory estoppel against the < org > in the exercise of its governmental public or executive powers it was held in this case in paragraph of the judgment that the respondent could not invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel because he was unable to show that relying on the representation of the govern ment he had altered his position by investing moneys and the allegations made by him in that behalf were much too vague and general and there was accordingly no factual foundation for establishing the plea of promissory estoppel moreover it is clear from paragraph of the judgment that this court did not intend to lay down any proposition of law different from that enunciated in the < org > case because it approved of the decision in the < org > case and distinguished it on the ground that in that case there was not enforcement of contractual right but the claim was founded upon equity arising from the scheme while in the case before the court a contractual right was sought to be enforced there is therefore nothing in this decision which should compel us to take a view different from the one we are otherwise inclined to accept this court approved of the decisions in the indo afghan agencies case and < org > case and pointed out that these were cases where it could be held that public bodies or the < org > are as much bound as private individuals are to carry out obligations incurred by them because parties seeking to bind the authorities have altered their position to their disadvantage or
251	have acted to their detriment on the strength of the representations made by these authorities it would therefore be seen that there is no authoritative decision of < org > which has departed from the law laid down in the celebrated decisions in the indo afghan agencies case and < org > case the law laid down in these decisions as elaborated and expounded by us continues to hold the field it is clear from the letter of the th respondent dated rd january that a categorical representation was made by the th respondent on behalf of the < org > that the proposed vanaspati factory of the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected in uttar pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production this representation was made by way of clarification in view of the suggestion in the appellant letter dated nd january that the financial institutions were not prepared to regard the earlier letter of the th respondent dated nd december as a definite commitment on the part of the < org > to grant exemption from sales tax now the letter dated rd january clearly shows that the th respondent made this representation in his capacity as the chief secretary of the < org > and it was therefore a representation on behalf of the government it was faintly contended before us on behalf of the < org > that this representation was not binding on the < org > but we cannot countenance this argument because in the first place the averment in the writ petition that the th respondent made this representation on behalf of the government was not denied by the < org > in the affidavit in reply filed on its behalf and secondly it is difficult to accept the contention that the th respondent who was at the material time the chief secretary to the government and also advisor to the governor who was discharging the functions of the < org > we must therefore proceed on the basis that this representation made by the th respondent was a representation within the scope of his authority and was binding on the < org > the < org > however contended that the doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application in the present case because the appellant did not suffer any detriment by acting on the representation made by the < org > the vanaspati factory set up by the appellant was quite a profitable concern and there was no prejudice caused to the appellant we do not think it is necessary in order to attract the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel that the promisee acting in reliance of the
252	promise should suffer any detriment this position was implied accepted by < name > in the high trees case when the learned judge pointed out that the promise must be one which was intended to create legal relations and which to the knowledge of the person making the promise was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact acted an emphasis supplied viscount < name > also observed in < org > < org > that the gist of the equity lies in the fact that one party has by his conduct led the other to alter his position then again in < name > < name > supra lord < name > said this equity is however subject to the qualification that the other party has altered his position there is in fact not a single case in england where detriment is insisted upon as a necessary ingredient of promissory estoppel we do not think that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is necessary for the promise to show that he suffered detriment as a result of acting in reliance on the promise but we may make it clear that if by detriment we mean injustice to the promisee which could result if the promisor were to recede from his promise then detriment would certainly come in as a necessary ingredient the detriment in such a case is not some prejudice suffered by the promisee by acting on the promise but the prejudice which would be caused to the promisee if the promisor were allowed to go back on the promise the classic exposition of detriment in this sense is to be found in the following passage from the judgment of < name > in the australian case of < name > < org > it is often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment although substantially such a statement is correct and leads to no misunderstanding it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the doctrine that purpose is to avoid or prevent a detriment to the party asserting the estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting this means that the real detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the change of position if the assumption were deserted that led to it so long as the assumption is adhered to the party who altered his situation upon the faith of it cannot complain his complaint is that when afterwards the other party makes a different state of affairs the basis of an assertion of right against him then if it is allowed his own original change of position will operate as a detriment his
253	action or inaction must be such that if the assumption upon which he proceeded were shown to be wrong and an inconsistent state of affairs were accepted as the foundation of the rights and duties of himself and the opposite party the consequence would be to make his original act or failure to act or source of prejudice it would therefore be correct to say that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is enough to show that the promisee has acting in reliance of the promise altered his position and it is not necessary for him to further show that he has acted to his detriment here the appellant clearly altered its position by borrowing moneys from various financial institutions purchasing plant and machinery from < org > bombay and setting up a vanaspati plant in the belief induced by the representation of the < org > that sales tax exemption would be granted for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production of course it may be pointed out that if the sales tax act did not contain a provision enabling the < org > to grant exemption it would not be possible to enforce the representation against the < org > because the < org > cannot be compelled to act contrary to the statute but since section of the sales tax act confers power on the < org > to grant exemption from sales tax the < org > can legitimately be held bound by its promise to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax it is true that taxation is a sovereign or governmental function but for reasons which we have already discussed no distinction can be made between the exercise of a sovereign or governmental function and a trading or business activity of the < org > so far as the doctrine of promissory estoppel is concerned we are therefore of the view that in the present case the < org > was bound to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected by it in the state of uttar pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production and was not entitled to recover such sales tax from the appellant but when the assessment was made by < org > sales tax was levied on the appellant at the rate of and the appellant was required to pay up a further sum of rs the appellant had prayed for an interim order in the present appeal staying further proceedings but this court by an order dated rd april granted interim stay only on the appellant paying up the amount of sales tax due for the assessment year before st july and so far as the assessment years and were concerned the court directed
254	that the assessments for those years may proceed but only the final order shall not be passed it appears that surcharge amounting to rs now obviously since the government is bound to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from nd july being the date of commencement of the production the appellant would not be liable to pay any sales tax to the < org > in respect of sales of vanaspati effected during that period and hence the < org > would have to refund to the appellant the amount of sales tax paid for the period nd july to st march subject to any claim which the < org > may have to retain any part of such amount under any provision of law if no such claim is made or if made not adjudicated upon within the time specified the < org > will refund the amount of sales tax to the appellant with interest thereon at the rate of per annum from the date when such refund becomes due and if such claim is made and adjudicated upon within the specified time and it is found that a part of this amount is liable to be retained by the < org > under some provision of law the < org > will refund the balance to the appellant with interest at the like rate so far as the assessment years and are concerned < org > will proceed to complete the assessments for those assessment years in the light of the law laid down in this judgment and the amounts of sales tax deposited by the appellant will be refunded to the appellant to the extent to which they are not found due and payable as a result of the assessments subject to any claim which the < org > may have to retain those amounts under any provision of law we accordingly allow the appeal set aside the judgment of < org > and issue a writ order or direction to the above effect against the respondents the state will pay the costs of the appellant throughout [SEP]
255	[CLS] this appeal is directed against the order in original dt he held that by their actions the goods are liable for confiscation and also they are liable for penalty under section a of the < org > act the goods shall be assesseed on merits and the duty of customs amounting to rs on the basis of the examination the concerned appraising officer had definite doubts regarding the validity of the export to ussr from the details of the consignment the department gathered that the appellants had cleared a consignment declared as units of haemafiltration instrument haemodialysers life saving equipments and accessories and spares for above and acetate concentrate and others of west german make contained in containers vide home consumption the acetate concentrate and others were cleared on payment of duty at basic duty auxiliary duty and though they cleared the goods for home consumption under home consumption after availing themselves of duty exemption benefits and the provisions of stock and sale under ogl without declaring at the time of clearance that the imported goods are meant for re export they presented the same for re export noting all these details the department in the show cause notice alleged that the importer had contravened the provisions of saving clause of the export trade control order and saving clause of the import trade control order and the conditions of ogl of am read with import export control act and section of the customs act and accordingly these goods are liable to confiscation under section of the customs act since the goods were cleared for home consumption under nil rate of duty under custom notification no but later on re exported the customs duty was payable on these goods at the appropriate rate the appellants filed a detailed reply therefore considering the fact that the goods had already been exported he proceeded to taken action in terms of the bond bank guarantee and cash deposit furnished by the exporter he imposed a penalty of rs thus they had made a profit of more than rs one crores in this transaction although it caused considerable loss of hard currency to the country he also held that the transaction was more motivated by the huge profit rather than the desire to held the armenian earthquake victims which was the ostensible reason given by the exporters after the matter was decided by the < org > in favour of the < org > the appellants took the matter to hon ble < org > of india while determining the case the hon ble < org > in para incidentally also noted that the hon ble < org > was not concerned with the questions of whether the attempt of the assesse
256	##e to export the goods which has in the event been successful would amount to an infringement of the conditions permitting the import so as to render either the import itself vide section of the act or the exemption from the import duty or both illegal and invalid and if so the consequences thereof this was said when the counsel for the < org > emphasised on the circumstances that the importer had obtained the import of the goods free of duty relying on the notification granting exemption from customs duty in terms of proviso to section of the < org > act and also demanded as to why the goods concerned should not be held liable to confiscation under section of the < org > act and why a penalty should not be imposed under section a of the < org > act the learned collector after dealing with the matter on the liability to pay the duty under notification somehow has dealt with time bar aspect without keeping in view the previous proceedings and dropping of duty demand by the collector < name > the first important aspect of the matter is as to whether the < org > can initiate the proceedings by issue of fresh show cause notice dt months after the earlier proceedings having culminated by the judgment of < org > rendered on as can be seen from the judgment of the hon ble < org > the < org > had raised the arguments before < org > that the importer had obtained import of the goods free of duty by relying on the notification granting exemption from the customs duty the hon ble < org > after noting such arguments of the < org > proceeded to say that the intention is therefore relevant for the issue before the court to the limited extent that it lends support to the construction of list of appendix in the manner the court interpreted it further the hon ble < org > proceeded to say that they were not concerned with the question whether the attempt of the assessee to export the goods which is in the event been successful would amount to infringement of the conditions permitting the import so as to render either import itself vide section of the act or the exemption from import duty or both illegal and invalid and if so the consequences thereof it can be very clearly noticed that in the previous proceedings the collector dropped the demands for duty both on the ground that he did not have jurisdiction and also that the duty is not demandable as the goods were exempted under the notification the relevant has also been defined in sub section of section means a in a case where duty is not levied the date on which the proper officer makes an order for the clearance of
257	the goods in a case where duty is provisionally assessed under section the date of adjustment of duty after the final assessment thereof in a case where duty has been erroneously refunded the date of refund in any other case the date of payment of duty therefore from the facts and circumstances of the case it appears that on a different opinion being taken by collector bombay in the matter other than that expressed by the < org > < org > and < org > in the matter in view of the findings given on the time bar and the unsustainability of the proceedings the question of entering into the merits would not arise in the present case however the counsel had also argued on this aspect and had relied on several rulings and had also pointed out that < org > had been granting benefit of the < org > similar circumstances when goods were exported without any manufacturing process carried out and the goods having been utilised for home consumption we notice that on this aspect of the matter < org > has very clearly held in para that although there is no express prohibition the re export as such of items of goods specified in list and imported into india is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of and the scheme underlying the grant of ogl in regard to them the learned dr submitted that there is mis declaration and that the appellants were required to have declared in the bill of entry the purpose for which the imported goods are required that they would be used in india only or would be sold in india or would be exported outside india without any process of manufacture being carried out the expression home consumption has also in the context no clear or definite meaning and raised a lot of conundrums if literally interpreted to mean that imported goods should always be consumed in india the court raised question that is it home consumption if the importer does not use the goods himself but sells them at what point of time should the importer make up his mind whether he proposes to sell the imported goods in india or wishes to export them outside the court again raised the question that is the condition infringed if a purchaser of goods from the importer sells it to buyer in a foreign country will it be permissible for the importer to use the imported goods in the manufacture of other goods which he proposes to export < org > answered that all these uncertainties in the connotation of the expression home consumption preclude one from giving an interpretation to this expression that the imported goods cannot be at all exported and incline one to hold that in the context it is only used in
258	contrast to the expression for warehousing < org > in para precisely answered that the charges raised in the present show cause notice about the importer making capital of the export and did not accept the < org > interpretation and also held that it is possible to think of cases where though economically unremunerative the re exports can be justified on considerations of international amity and goodwill such as for example where the goods are exported to a country which is in dire need of help and assistance the above general consideration apart there are other indications in the statute which show that the act does not prohibit the export of imported goods the act provides that goods which are cleared from the customs area for warehousing can be cleared from the warehouse for home consumption it is indeed suggested by < org > counsel that if an importer intends to export the imported goods he should clear them for warehousing and then proceed in terms of section but where for one reason or other he wants to import the goods into india and then sell them to the foreign country or where the importer decides on an export sale only after he has arranged for the import of the goods into india the act prescribes no form of a bill of entry under which he can clear such goods intended for re export whether to deposit the goods in warehouse or not is an option given to the importer but where he has either some difficulty in payment of the duties or where he has no ready place to stock the goods before use or sale he cannot clear the goods from the customs area there is nothing in the provisions of the act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in india or whether he proposes to re export them it would make export trade difficult to say that he cannot accept the export offer as the goods when imported had been cleared for home consumption section therefore should be only read as a provision setting out the procedure for export of warehoused goods and not as a provision which makes warehousing an imperative pre condition for exporting the imported goods incidentally we may observe that even this principle contended for by < org > may itself be of doubtful validity as it is based on an erroneous assumption that a re export of imported goods will always be detrimental to the country but conceivably there may be cases where an importer is able to import goods from soft currency area and sell them in a hard currency area earning foreign exchange for the country it is also possible to think of cases where though economically
259	unremunerative the re exports can be justified on considerations of international amity and goodwill such as for example where the goods are exported to a country which is in a dire need of help and assistance the question raised by the < org > in the present case are also answered by < org > as can be clearly noted member i am writing my separate order as under proviso to section of the < org > act provides that where any duty has not been levied or has not been short levied or erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any wilful mis statement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter the provisions of sub section will have the effect as if for the words proper officer the words collector of < org > and for the words one year and six months the words five years were substituted collector of < org > kandla has jurisdiction only in regard to port at kandla and such other areas as are specified in the notification issued by the government likewise collector of < org > bombay has jurisdiction in regard to matters pertaining to specified bombay region < org > held < org > has issued notifications under section of the < org > act appointing collectors of < org > and lower officers for different jurisdictions in terms of these notifications the respective jurisdictions of the collectors have been clearly spelt out see for example notification no cus notification no dated as amended appoints the collector of < org > and < org > cochin as the collector of < org > in his jurisdiction evidently it does not extend to madras port for which the collector is the collector of < org > madras vide notification no dated there are of course a few officers appointed as collectors with all india jurisdiction such as the director of revenue intelligence but the collector of < org > cochin is not one among them in these circumstances we hold that the collector of < org > cochin had no jurisdiction to demand duty in the present case and consequently we set aside the demand dated as amended < org > in exercise of powers conferred by sub section of section of < org > act have appointed officers mentioned in column of the table appended to the notification to be collectors of < org > it may not therefore be possible to hold that proceedings had already been initiated and therefore fresh proceedings could not be initiated it can therefore be seen that it was not fresh proceeding initiated by the proper officer after he had initially initiated the proceedings and dropped the demand of duty in
260	fact collector of < org > < org > while dropping the demand himself admitted that he had no jurisdiction in relation to the matter pertaining to duty it is not the case of the appellants that as soon as they were penalised at < org > or they were issued a show cause notice by < org > < org > they made disclosure of these facts to the proper officer in relation to the imports i collector of < org > bombay collector of < org > bombay therefore was competent to initiate proceedings against the appellants as soon as he came to know that a short levy had indeed taken place since goods had been exported and this fact had not been disclosed to the proper officer < org > held that the circumstances that these items are also exempt from customs duty at the time of import also lends support to the conclusion that the goods so permitted are not meant for re export < org > therefore held we are therefore of the opinion that although there is no express prohibition the re export as such of items of goods specified in list and imported into india is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of and the scheme underlying the grant of ogl in regard to them here we have a situation where goods have been contracted for re export even prior to their import in the statement dated of shri < name > it is indicated that they had prior orders for exporting these items and they had to check the feasibility of import of these commodities taking into consideration the duty free import under notification no it is also admitted by him that they made a gross profit of approximately rs he also admitted to have availed benefit of notification to import goods with no import duty and that the interest was purely business interest it has also been admitted by him that the goods were imported and cleared form < org > with the sole purpose of exporting these to russia with a business intention and to earn adequate profits it is therefore clear that even prior to import of goods cleared under duty exemption the appellants had entered into contract for re export of these goods as such to earn profits in the light of this it is obvious that the appellants when they imported goods and claimed duty free exemption already knew that they would be exporting the goods and they knew also that they could not export these goods without subjecting them to certain processes and therefore as was contended by the < org > before < org > they put up a facade of taking the goods to ankleshwar after their import allegedly for being subjected to some processes < or
261	##g > in case of < name > ecr sc held that extended period is applicable where there was wilful mis statement and suppression of facts by the importer in the instant case the appellant had obtained the import licence dated february for expansion of its business on the recommendation of the director of industries kerala state and the said import licence contained specific endorsement of project import when the goods arrived at the port in india the appellant filed a bill of entry on november with the customs authorities which contained a declaration signal by a partner of the appellant in addition the appellant submitted an application form dated november before the customs authorities for registration under project import registration of contracts regulations wherein it was stated that the goods to be imported were for substantial expansion of an existing plant and that the existing installed capacity of the plant of the appellant was sq there is nothing on the record to show that the appellant had informed the customs authorities that the machinery to be imported would be transferred by the appellant to the < org > and the < org > would install the same on the other hand the endorsement on the import licence submitted with the bill of entry which contained a declaration by a partner of the appellant and the statements contained in the application from for registration dated november indicated that the appellant would be using the imported machinery for substantial expansion of its existing unit and on that basis the appellant was assessed for duty at a concessional rate under head ing no of the customs tariff since the appellant did not install the said machinery for the expansion of its existing unit but transferred it to the < org > after it had been cleared from the customs the appellant cannot claim the benefit of the concessional rate of duty under heading no of the customs tariff and is liable to pay such duty at the normal rates prescribed in the customs tariff in sub section of section it is prescribed that a notice shall be served on the person chargeable with the duty requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice the said notice has to be served within one year of the relevant date in cases when import is made by an individual for his personal use or by < org > or by an educational research or charitable institution or hospital and the period for service of such notice is six months in other cases the proviso to sub section of section enhances the aforementioned periods for service of the notice to five years in cases where any duty has not been levied or has been short levied or erroneously refunded by reasons of collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter or the agent or employee of
262	the importer or exporter the present case falls within the ambit of the said proviso because the appellant had cleared the goods from the customs on payment of concessional rate of duty under heading no of the customs tariff by making a misstatement in the application form dated november for registration under the project import registration of contracts regulations that the machinery that had been imported was for substantial expansion of the existing industrial unit of the appellant and by suppressing the fact that under agreement dated july the appellant had agreed to transfer the said machinery to the < org > in the circumstances the collector was justified in directing that the goods in question should be re assessed to duty on merits under the appropriate heading of the customs tariff without giving the benefit of the assessment under heading and to collect the short levy from the appellant considering goods had been contracted for export even prior to import and yet they claimed exemption when they knew such exemption could not be availed of in case goods were for re export as such extended period for demanding duty was sustainable in view of difference of opinion between the members the following question arises for determination by third member on reference of the matter by hon ble president whether the appeal is required to be allowed in terms of findings given by member < org > in his order or the appeal is required to be rejected in terms of the order recorded by member technical in his order i have heard both sides on difference of opinion the facts are set out in the first eight paragraphs of the order of the judicial member order and therefore i do not propose to repeat them it is first contended by the advocate for the appellant that the demand is barred by limitation the notice issued in april for goods imported in invokes the extended period provided in section of the act on the ground that the importer did not declare on the bill of entry till investigation commenced that the goods were intended to be exported to the ussr he points out that < org > has clearly held that the demand is barred by limitation on merits he contends that when the goods were imported in the appellant was under the bonafide impression that notification would apply and the goods were for stock and sale going by the plain meaning of the policy and the notification the appellant had every reason to believe that the goods were intended to be imported under ogl and were exempt from duty when they were imported the point if any in export has been wiped out and there is no reason to deny the importation there is no material to show this and the order itself says that he came to know from intelligence he says that it is not possible to say whether the earlier export
263	##s were of goods disclosed to be imported goods and they may have been declared as goods manufactured in india it had also observed in para that it would not have been the intention of the legislature to grant exemption from < org > duty in respect of vital goods and in order that the importer may make profit by selling them abroad in that the notification was issued in the public interest which means the interest of the public in india member judicial has found that the proceedings were barred by limitation because the full facts were known to the collector of < org > kandla when he issued the demand for duty and subsequently dropped it the view of the member technical is that there are clear territorial division with which each collector exercise his jurisdiction and it does not follow that merely because the collector of < org > kandla initiated and dropped the proceedings for duty the collector of < org > at mumbai was aware of the imported goods sought to be re exported the import took place in october and the notice was issued in april i four years and six months after the importation the collector also says that the appellant took the goods to ankleshwar ostensibly for processing although no such processing has been carried out the attribute of the goods being a life saving drug medicine or equipment would continue whether the goods are utilised for that purpose in india or elsewhere member < name > finds the notice was barred by limitation as the revenue had all the information to initiate proceedings for recovery of duty < org > in mj exports cegat in para itself noted that there nothing in the provisions of the < org > act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in india or whether he proposes to re export them it would make export trade difficult to say that he cannot accept such an offer as the goods when imported had been cleared for home consumption the < org > in making its observation was interpreting the provisions of sections and of the act and answering the contention of the revenue before it that the goods cleared for home consumption are prohibited for export in that situation obviously the extended period could not be invoked on the ground that there was suppression of facts or mis statement it is however possible that he may have changed his mind and decided to keep the goods in india say that if the deal with russia fell through or was cancelled because of it is more profitable to sell the goods in india this would also lend support to the plea that there was no bar to export of
264	such goods for the extended period provided in the proviso to section to apply in the facts of this case it must be shown that the appellant while being aware that the benefit of the notification would not be available for the reason that export of goods subsequent to import under and clearance under the notification was not permissible suppressed from the department the fact that the goods were to be exported i therefore agree with the member judicial that the demand is barred by limitation as the extended period will not apply he agreed with the submission that he had no jurisdiction to demand on the goods imported through bombay he added that even otherwise notification exempts the goods unconditionally from import duty when once the collector of < org > < name > admits that he has no jurisdiction and says so his subsequent observation that the demand for duty is unsustainable cannot be binding on this point i agree with the views expressed by the member technical there is therefore no difference of opinion on this aspect [SEP]
265	[CLS] but it did not pay the amount collected to the < org > the < org > directed the appellant to pay the amount to the < org > and it thereupon filed a writ petition in < org > questioning the validity of of the hyderabad general sales tax act the main contention of the appellant before < org > was that of the act which authorises the < org > to recover a tax collected without the authority of law was beyond the competence of < org > because a tax collected without the authority of law would not be a tax levied under the law and it would therefore not be open to the < org > to collect under the authority of a law enacted under the entry of list ii of the vii schedule to the constitution any such amount as it was not a tax on sale or purchase of goods held i it cannot be said that < org > was directly legislating for the imposition of sales or purchase tax under entry list ii when it made the provisions of a for on the face of the provisions the amount though collected by way of tax was not exigible as tax under the law even so there is a limit to such incidental or ancillary powers these have to be exercised in aid of the than topic of legislation which in the present case is a tax on sale or purchase of goods the ambit of ancillary or incidental powers does not so to the extent of permitting the legislature to provide that though the amount collected may be wrongly by way of tax is not exigible under the law as made under the relevant taxing entry it shall still be paid over to the govern ment as if it were a tax therefore the provision contained in a cannot be made under entry list ii and cannot be justified as incidental or ancillary provisions permitted under that entry there is no element of regulation of trade and commerce in a provision like and therefore that section cannot be justified under entry the judgment of the court was delivered by < name > an appeal by special leave against the order of < org > the appellant filed a writ petition in < org > questioning the validity of of the hyderabad general sales tax act no xiv of hereinafter referred to as the act the appellant acted as agent in the then state of hyderabad to both resident and non resident principals in regard to sale of betel leaves after realising the tax however the appellant did not pay the amount realised to the < org > but kept it in the suspense account of
266	its principals namely the purchasers when the accounts were scrutinized by < org > this was discovered and thereupon the appellant was called upon to pay the amounts realised to the < org > the appellant however objected to the payment on the ground that it was the seller and the relevant notification for the relevant period imposed tax at the purchase point i on the purchaser the main contention raised on behalf of the appellant in < org > was that of the act which authorised the < org > to recover from any person who had collected or collects after may any amount by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the argument was that the act was passed under entry of list of the seventh schedule to the constitution which enables the state legislature to enact a law taxing transactions of sale or purchase of goods the entry therefore vests power in the state legislature to make a law for taxing sales and pur chases of goods and for making all necessary incidental provisions in that behalf for the levy and collection of sales or purchase tax but it was urged that that entry did not empower the state legislature to enact a law by which a dealer who may have collected a tax without authority is required to hand over the amount to < org > as any collection without the authority of law would not be a tax levied under the law and it would therefore not be open to the state to collect under the authority of a law enacted under entry of list ii any such amount as it was not a tax on sale or purchase of goods < org > having refused a certificate to appeal to this court the appellant obtained special leave and that is how the matter has come up be fore us it is necessary to read ii of the act in order to appre ciate the point urged on behalf of the appellant section is in these terms no person who is not registered as a dealer hall collect any amount by way of tax under this act nor shall a registered dealer make any such collection before the st day of may except in accordance with such conditions and restrictions if any as may be prescribed provided that government may exempt persons who are not registered dealers from the provisions of this sub section until such date not being later than the st day of june as government may direct notwithstanding to the contrary contained in any order of an officer or tribunal or judgment decree or order of a court every person who has collected or collects on or before st may any amount by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act shall pay over to the government within such time and in such manner as
267	may be prescribed the amount so collected by him that provision however does not apply in the present case for the appellant is admittedly a registered dealer it applies to collections made after may by any person whether a registered dealer or otherwise and lays down that any amount collected by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the act shall be paid over to the government and in default of such payment the said amount shall be recovered from such person as if it were arrears of land revenue it is clear from the words other wise than in accordance with the provisions of this act that though the amount may have been collected by way of tax it was not exigible as tax under the act section thus provides that amounts collected by way of tax though not exigible as tax under the act shall be paid over to government and if not paid over they shall be recovered from such person as if they were arrears of land revenue clearly therefore as it stands provides for recovery of an amount collected by way of tax as arrears of land revenue though the amount was not due as tax under the act the first question therefore that falls for consideration is whether it was open to the state legislature under its powers under entry of list ii to make a provision to the effect that money collected by way of tax even though it is not due as a tax under the act shall be made over to government so it cannot be said that the state legislature was directly legislating for the imposition of sales or purchase tax under entry of list ii when it made such a provision for on the face of the provision the amount though collected by way of tax the provision however is attempted to be justified on the ground that though it may not be open to a state legislature to make provision for the recovery of an amount which is not a tax under entry of list in a law made for that purpose it would still be open to the legislature to provide for paying over all the amounts collected by way of tax by persons even though they really are not exigible as tax as part of the incidental and ancillary power to make provision for the levy and collection of such tax now there is no dispute that the heads of legislation in the various lists in the seventh schedule should be interpreted widely so as to take in all matters which are of a character incidental to the topics mentioned therein even so there is a limit to such incidental or ancillary power flowing from the legislative entries in the various lists in the seventh schedule these incidental and ancillary powers have to be exercised in aid of the main topic of legislation
268	which in the present case is a tax on sale or purchase of goods all powers necessary for the levy and collection of the tax concerned and for seeing that the tax is not evaded are comprised within the ambit of the legislative entry as ancillary or incidental but where the legislation under the relevant entry proceeds on the basis that the amount concerned is not a tax exigible under the law made under that entry but even so lays down that though it is not exigible under the law it shall be paid over to government merely because some dealers by mistake or otherwise have collected it as tax it is difficult to see how such provision can be ancillary or incidental to the collection of tax legitimately due under a law made under the relevant taxing entry we do not think that the ambit of ancillary or incidental power goes to the extent of permitting the legislature to provide that though the amount collectedmay be wrongly by way of tax is not exigible under the law as made under the relevant taxing entry it shall still be aid over to government as if it were a tax the legisla turd cannot under entry of list ii make a provision to the effect that even though a certain amount collected is not a tax on the sale or purchase of goods as laid down by the law it will still be collected as if it was such a tax such a provision cannot in our opinion be treated as coming within incidental or ancillary powers which the legislature has got under the relevant taxing entry to ensure that the tax is levied and collected and that its evasion becomes impossible we are therefore of opinion that the provision contained in cannot be made under entry of list and cannot be justified even as an incidental or ancillary provision permitted under that entry but as we read we cannot find anything in it to justify that it is a penalty for breach of any prohibition in the act penalties imposed under taxing statutes are generally with respect to attempts at evasion of taxes or to default in the payment of taxes properly levied see ss and of the indian income tax act the act also provides for penalties for example and section in our opinion has nothing to do with penalties and cannot be justified as a penalty on the dealer actually makes provision in cl for penalty in case of breach of ii and makes the person committing a breach of that provision liable on conviction by a magistrate of the first class to a fine we are therefore of opinion that cannot be justified under entry of list ii either as a provision for levying the tax or as an incidental or ancillary provision
269	relating to the collection of tax in this connection we may refer to cl of which provides that any person who fails to pay the amounts specified in sub section of section within the prescribed time shall on a conviction by a magistrate be liable to fine it is remarkable that this provision makes the person punish able for his failure to pay the amount which is not authorised as a tax at all under the law to government it does not provide for a penalty collecting the amount wrongly by way of tax from purchasers which may have been justified as a penalty for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the taxing legislation if a dealer has collected anything from a purchaser which is not authorised by the taxing law that is a matter between him and the purchaser and the purchaser may be entitled to recover the amount from the dealer that case in our opinion has no application to the facts of the present case respect of goods despatched for consumption outside the < org > were held to be not taxable the dealer then applied for refund of tax which was held to be not exigible < org > allowed the petition in part and there were appeals to this court both by the dealer and the < org > in the meantime the orissa legislature amended the law by introducing a in the principal act which provided that refund could be claimed only by a person from whom the dealer had actually realised the amount as tax we are not dealing with a case of refund in the present case what ii provides is that something collected by way of tax though it is not really due as a tax under the law enacted under entry of list ii must be paid to the < org > lastly we come to the contention of the respondent that is within the legislative competence of the < org > legislature in view of entry of list that entry deals with trade and commerce within the < org > subject to the provisions of entry of list iii entry of list deals with trade and commerce and has nothing to do with taxing or recovering amounts realised wrongly as tax it is said that regulates trade and commerce and the < org > legislature therefore was competent under entry of list ii to enact it if it cannot be so justified as we hold that it cannot we are unable to uphold it as regulating trade and commerce under entry of list ii there is in our opinion no element of regulation of trade and commerce in a provision like we therefore allow the appeal and quash the assessment order dated september insofar as it is based on ii the appellant will get his costs in this < org > as

274	what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given this shows that the fiction has been created for the purpose of computation of the assessable income of the assessee under the head business income a legal fictions are created only for a definite purpose and they should be limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond their legitimate field the fiction under is created for the purpose of computation of assessable income of the assessee under the head business income and under in order to compute and allow the permissible special deduction computation of total income in accordance with the other provisions of the act is required to be done and after allowing such deduction the net assessable income chargeable to tax is to be determined in other words the legal fiction under and the grant of special deduction in case of specified industries are so closely connected with each other that taking into account the balancing charge i deemed profits before computing deduction under would amount to extending the legal fiction within the limits of the purpose for which the said fiction had been created whenever the < org > wanted to give a restricted meaning it has used the expression derived from as for instance in since the expression of wider import namely attributable to has been used the legislature intended to cover receipts from sources other than the actual conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity having regard to the construction placed on sub of section as above it is obvious that in computing the total income of the concerned assessee items of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate will have to be deducted before arriving at the figure that will become exigible to the deduction of contemplated by in sub of the expression total income is followed by the words as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this act in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression total income has been used in the sense of commercial profits the expression total income has been defined in of the act as meaning the total amount of income referred to in section computed in the manner laid down in this act and when this definition has been furnished by the act itself the expression as appearing in must be in the absence of anything in the context suggesting to the contrary be construed in accordance with such definition the question whether special benefit under as well as the normal or usual benefit of carry forward of losses of previous years should both be available to an assessee without one impinging on the other must depend upon the intention of the < org > and such intention has to be

277	our view the answer to the question raised before us really turns upon the proper construction of the provision contained in of the act rather than on what is the real nature or character of a balancing charge arising under of the act and it would therefore be proper to set out the provisions of as it stood at the relevant time in the case of a company to which this section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the fifth schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent thereof in computing the total income of the company this section applies to a an indian company or any other company which has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends including dividends on preference shares within india but does not apply to any indian company referred to in clause a or to any other company referred to in clause if such indian or other company is a company referred to in section and its total income as computed before applying the provisions of sub section does not exceed twenty five thousand rupees it was not disputed before us that the aforesaid provision contained in has been enacted for the purpose of providing for certain special deduction to be made in computing the total income in the case of specified industries over and above the other general deductions contemplated by the act us that the assessee being an indian company engaged in the business of generation and distribution of electricity is a company to which the section applies and is entitled to claim the deduction of contemplated by that provision and the only question is how and in what manner the said deduction should be computed on reading sub it will become clear that three important steps are required to be taken before the special deduction permissible thereunder is allowed and the net total income exigible to tax is determined first compute the total income of the concerned assessee in accordance with the other provisions of the act i in accordance with all the provisions except secondly ascertain what part of the total income so computed represents the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity and thirdly if there be profits and gains so attributable deduct thereof from such profits and gains and then arrive at the net total income exigible to tax as regards the first step mentioned above the important words in sub are those that appear in parenthesis
278	namely as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this act and these words clearly contain a mandate that the total income of the concerned assessee must be computed in accordance with the other provisions of the act without reference to and since in the instant case it is income from business the same as per will have to be computed in accordance with ss to a which would include in the case of < org > supra the question that arose for determination was whether a balancing charge which was brought to tax on the basis of deemed income and was therefore included in the assessable income of an assessee under the second proviso to cl vii of sub of of the act equivalent to of the act could be taken into account while considering smallness of profit for purposes of deciding whether the case attracted the applicability of a of the act and this < org > took the view that the balancing charge was not real income but was made taxable income for the purpose of computation of the assessable income by legal fiction but on that account it did not become commercial profit and was not liable to be taken into account in assessing whether in view of the smallness of profits a larger dividend would be unreasonable in that context this < org > observed that what in truth was a capital return was by a fiction regarded for the purposes of the act as income and was made chargeable to income tax but because of that its character was not altered and it was not converted into assessee business profits and that smallness of profit in a had to be adjudged in the light of commercial principles and not in the light of total receipts actual or fictional in the subsequent decision in the < org > case supra this < org > has regarded a balancing charge as being the escaped profits of the business for which the assessee is made liable to tax if the machinery is sold for rs if it had not been allowed that amount would have swelled the profits to that extent the second proviso therefore in substance brings to charge an escaped profit or gain of the business carried on by the assessee these apparently divergent views have given rise to two rival contentions urged before us by counsel on other tide it is unnecessary in this case to go into the question whether the divergence is real or merely apparent for it is true that by a legal fiction created under a balancing charge arising from sale of old machinery or building is treated as deemed income and the same is brought to tax in other words the legal fiction enables the < org > to take back what it had given by way of depreciation allowance
279	in the preceding years since what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given this shows that the fiction has been created for the purpose of computation of the assessable income of the assessee under the head business income it was rightly pointed out by the learned solicitor general that legal fictions are created only for a definite purpose and they should be limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond their legitimate field but as indicated earlier the fiction under is created for the purpose of computation of assessable income of the assessee under the head business income and under in order to compute and allow the permissible special deduction computation of total income in accordance with the other provisions of the act is required to be done and after allowing such deduction the net assesaable income chargeable to tax is to be determined in other words the legal fiction under and the grant of special deduction in case of specified industries are so closely connected with each other that taking into account the balancing charge i deemed profits before computing the deduction under would amount to extending the legal fiction within the limits of the purpose for which the said fiction had been created as regards the aspect emerging from the expression attributable to occurring in the phrase profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity on which the learned solicitor general relied it will be pertinent to observe that the < org > has deliberately used the expression attributable to and not the expression derived from had the expression derived from been used it could have with some force been contended that a balancing charge arising from the sale of old machi nery and buildings cannot be regarded as profits and gains derived from the conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity in this connection it may be pointed out that whenever the < org > wanted to give a restricted meaning in the manner suggested by the learned solicitor general it has used the expression derived from as for instance in for the aforesaid reasons and particularly on true construction of the provision itself we are of the view that both the < org > and < org > were right in taking the view that the item of rs here again the answer to the question must depend upon the construction of sub of and the construction which we have placed on the said provision while disposing of the < org > appeal will furnish the correct answer to the question posed as indicated earlier sub contemplates three steps being taken for computing the special deduction permissible thereunder and arriving at the net income exigible to tax and the
280	first two steps read together contain the legislative mandate as to how the total income of which the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry forms a part of the concerned assessee is to be computed and according to the parenthetical clause which contains the key words the same is to be computed in accordance with the provisions a the act except and since in this case it is income from business the same will have to be computed in accordance with ss to a which would include which provides for carry forward of depreciation and which provides for carry forward of development rabate for eight years on this construction therefore < org > in our view was right in deducting unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate aggregating to rs from rs in the first place before < org > it was strenuously urged though not seriously before us that the expression total income appearing in has been used in its commercial sense and since neither the unabsorbed depreciation nor the unabsorbed development rebate has anything to do with commercial profits in sub of the expression total income is followed by the words as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this act in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression total income has been used in the sense of commercial profits secondly the expression total income has been defined in of the act as meaning the total amount of income referred to in section computed in the manner laid down in this act and when this definition has been furnished by the act itself the expression as appearing in must in the absence of any thing in the context suggesting to the contrary be construed in accordance with such definition it may be stated that the first two decisions did not deal with the question of unabsorbed depreciation or unabsorbed rebate but merely dealt with the question of carried forward losses in the context of while the third decision dealt with all the three things carried forward loss carried forward depreciation and carried forward development rebate in the context of and it was held that the deduction under will have to be worked out before setting off or adjusting each of the three things in that case < org > held that as regards carried forward loss the point was covered by its earlier decision in < name > case supra that unabsorbed development rebate stood on the same footing as unabsorbed losses and as regards unabsorbed depreciation it took the view that since itself postponed the adjustment of unabsorbed depreciation to a stage subsequent to the set off of business losses under
281	and set off of the losses in speculation business under the unabsorbed depreciation cannot be it will thus appear clear that in the last mentioned case unabsorbed development rebate was held to be non deductible for the same reasons for which unabsorbed loss could not be deducted under the earlier decision and the unabsorbed depreciation was held to be non deductible on the basis of de priori reasoning the question that arises for consideration therefore is whether the view taken in regard to non deductibility of carried for i it is true that in the instant case the question of deductibility or otherwise of carried forward losses of earlier years in the context of has not directly arisen before us but since counsel for the assessee has raised a contention about non deductibility of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate on the basis of the view taken by < org > in < org > case supra and < org > in < name > case supra in regard to nondeductibility of unabsorbed losses of earlier years we are constrained to express our opinion on the validity of the view taken in those two cases in our opinion the view taken in < org > case supra and < name > case supra in regard to the nondeductibility of unabsorbed losses of the earlier years in the context of computing the deduction under of the act is open to grave doubts after pointing out that chapter iv of the act deals with the computation of income falling under the various heads mentioned in of the act that chapter vi in which occurs deals with the aggregation of income and set off or carry forward of loss and that deals with deduction to be made in computing total income the < org > has proceeded to observe thus computation as such is used only in the heading in chapter iv section also provides that in computing the total income of an assessee there shall be included all income on which no income tax is payable under chapter vii etc what is provided in section is also relating to computation similarly the same words are used in section but there are no such words in section section speaks of the net result of the computation under the bead profits and gains of business or profession we consider that the set off permitted under section is from an amount arrived at after applying the provisions of chapter iv along with other sections of the act such as sections and etc the court has further observed that in its opinion the deduction under is a special benefit given to a company which satisfies the
282	conditions under section and the deduction permissible thereunder is only from profits and gains attributable to the specified activities and this benefit should not be diminished by the other benefits conferred by the act such as the right to have the previous losses set off that the two serve different purposes and the benefit of both must be available to an assessee without the one impinging on the other it will thus appear that < org > has regarded section appear ing in chapter vi as a provision unconnected with the computation of the total income of an assessee and a provision which comes into operation at a stage subsequent to the computation of the total income arising from business done in accordance with ss to a occurring in chapter iv of the act and therefore the unabsorbed losses cannot be set off before calculating the deduction under it is not possible to accept the view that has no bearing on or is unconnected with the computation of the total income of an assessee under the head profits and gains of business or profession actually provides that where the net result of computation under the head profits and gains of business or profession is a loss and such loss cannot be or is not wholly set off against the income under any head of income in accordance with the provisions of so much of the loss as has not been so set off subject to the other provisions of the chapter shall be carried forward to the following assessment year and shall be set off against the profits and gains if any of any business or profession for that assessment year further the question whether special benefit under as well as the normal or usual benefit of carry forward of losses of previous years should both be available to an assessee without one impinging on the other must depend upon the intention of the < org > and such intention has to be gathered from the language employed as observed earlier on proper construction of the provision contained in sub of items like unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate will have to be deducted in arriving at the figure which would be exigible to deduction of under in our view that decision has nothing whatever to do with the question posed before us in that case the question was whether the loss incurred by an assessee in non priority business could be set off against the profits and gains made by the assessee in the priority business while computing the deduction under and < org > upheld the < org > view that for the purpose of allowing a deduction under the words such profits occurring in that section mean the profits
283	and gains attributable to an activity as specified in the th schedule of the act and therefore the deduction was required to be worked out with out reference to the loss incurred in non priority business the decision was rendered on the language of but it cannot avail the assessee on the point raised in the appeal [SEP]

286	purpose of levy of duties of customs on goods imported or exported by sea this makes it clear that the provisions conferring various powers on the sea < org > officers are for the purpose of levying and realization of duties of customs on goods and that those powers are conferred on the < org > customs officers also for the same purpose apart from such an expression in of the land < org > act there are good reasons in support of the view that the powers conferred on the < org > officers are different in character from those of the police officers for the detection and prevention of crime and that the powers conferred on them are merely for the purpose of ensuring that dutiable goods do not enter the country without payment of duty and that articles whose entry is prohibited are not brought in it is with respect to the detecting and preventing of the smuggling of goods and preventing loss to the central revenues that < org > officers have been given the power to search the property and person and to detain them and to summon persons to give evidence in an enquiry with respect to the smuggling of goods the preamble of the sea < org > act says whereas it is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to the levy of sea < org > duties the < org > officers are given the power to confiscate to fix the duty and to impose penalties which can in certain cases be of enormous amounts they have nothing to investigate about it similarly the offence at item relates to a person making a false declaration item creates an offence with respect to a person doing certain things to defraud the < org > the < org > officer therefore is not primarily concerned with the detection and punishment of crime committed by a person but is mainly interested in the detection and prevention of smuggling of goods and safeguarding the recovery of customs duties it was said at it is clear on a perusal of the above pro visions that the powers of search arrest and detention are given to the customs authorities for the levy of sea customs duties an provision is made at the same time for a reference to the magistrate in all cases where in < name > the estate of punjab it was there are as many as entriesin the schedule to besides those added later but each one of those or more entries though an offence being an act infringing certain provisions of the sections and rules under the act is not a criminal offence they i < org > officers have been only given limited powers of search similarly they have been given limited powers to summon persons to give evidence or to produce
287	documents further it was observed at it is true that the petitioners were dealt with by the collector of < org > for the offence of smuggling were found guilty and a deterrent punish ment was imposed upon them but as he had not been vested with the powers of a magistrate or a criminal court his proceedings against the petitioners were in the nature of < org > proceedings with a view to detecting the infringement of the provisions of the sea customs act and imposing penalties when it was found that they had been guilty of those infringements those penalties the collector had been empowered to impose in order not only to prevent a recurrence of such infringements but also to recoup the loss of such revenue resulting from such infringements a person is a member of the police force when he holds his office under any of the acts dealing with the police sections and of the police act provide for the appointment of special police officers who are not enrolled under the act but are appointed for special occasions and have the same powers privileges and protection and are liable to perform the same duties as the ordinary officer of the police there has however arisen a divergence of opinion about officers on whom some powers analogous to those of police officers have been conferred being police officers for the purpose of of the evidence act the view which favours their being held police officers is based on their possessing powers which are usually possessed by the police and on the supposed intention of the legislature at the time of the enactment of of the evidence act to be that the expression police officer should include every one who is engaged in the work of detecting and preventing crime the other view is based on the plain meaning of the expression and on the consideration that the mere fact that an officer who by no stretch of imagination is a police officer does not become one merely because certain powers similar to the powers of a police officer are conferred on him we now refer to certain aspects which lead us to consider that the expression police officer has not such a wide meaning as to include persons on whom certain police powers are conferred the object of enacting of the evidence act whose provisions formerly formed part of the code of criminal procedure was to exclude from evidence confessions made to the regular police which had a very bad reputation for the methods it employed in investigation especially in forcibly extracting confessions with the object of securing a conviction it is too much to suppose that the < org > did intend that all persons who may have to investigate or arrest persons or seize articles in pursuance of any particular law of which at the time it had no conception should be considered to be so unre
288	##liable that any confession made to them must be excluded just as a confession made to a regular police officer if it could not contemplate the later creation of offences or of agencies to take action in respect to them under future legislation it could not have intended the expression police officer to include officers entrusted in future with the duty of detecting and preventing smuggling and similar offences with the object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of < org > duties if the < org > had intended to use the expression police officer for such a wide purpose it would have used a more comprehensive expression it could have expressed its intention more clearly by making any confession made to any officer whose duty is to detect and prevent the commission of offences inadmissible in evidence the police officer referred to in of the evidence act need not be the officer investigating into that particular offence of which a person is subsequently accused < org > officers can even if the respondent contention be accepted be considered to be police officers only when they are exercising the limited powers which are similar to the powers of the police officers this is clear from the observations in the cases relied upon on behalf of the respondent is that in section of the act in respect of an officer of the police there is a personal disability implied irrespective of the question whether be is holding an investigation or not while no such disability can be said to have been intended in the case of an excise officer section empowers a police officer to seize articles liable to confiscation under the act on suspicion that they had been stolen section provides that the officer adjudging confiscation shall take and hold posses sion of the thing confiscated and every officer of police on request of such officer shall assist him in taking and holding such possession section a of the act empowers the < org > officer to summon any person to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing in any enquiry which he be making in connection with the smuggling of any goods it would be highly incongruous that moat of the offences under be disposed of by the < org > officers themselves and that such confessional statements recorded by < org > officers be good material for them to take action and to penalize the offender to any amount of fine and yet the and statements be held to be not admissible in evidence if they have to be used at a trial for a criminal offence in a regular court of law we therefore allow the appeal set aside the order of acquittal of the respondent for the aforesaid offences and restore the order of conviction passed by the magistrate and confirmed by the sessions judge we make it clear however that
289	we do not express any opinion on the question whether officers of departments other than the police on whom the powers of an officer in charge of a police station under ch xiv of the code of criminal procedure have been conferred are police officers or not for the purpose of of the evidence act as the learned counsel for the appellant did not question the correctness of this view for the purpose of this appeal i cannot bring myself to hold that while a confession made by an accused to a police officer is not admissible in evidence in a court of law the same if made under exactly similar circumstances to a customs officer can be relied and acted upon against the said order the accused filed revisions to < org > apart from the confessions alleged to have been made by the accused there was no other evidence to prove that they were guilty of the offence with which they were charged it was contended before < org > that the said confessional statements were hit by of the evidence act and therefore they were inadmissible in evidence < org > accepting the contention held that if the statements were excluded there was no other evidence to sustain the conviction the state has preferred the present appeal against the acquittal of < name > learned counsel for the < org > contended that < org > officials are not police officers within the meaning of of the evidence act and therefore the statements made by the respondents confessing their guilt were admissible in evidence and the convictions based thereon were sustainable the indian evidence act section no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence all offences under any other law shall be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner of place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences section the word police shall include all persons who shall be the police act of gives an inclusive definition of the word police and therefore it is not exhaustive and it comprehends not only such things as it signifies according to its natural import but also enlarges the meaning of the said word so as to take in other things section of the code of criminal procedure also contemplates investigation of or inquiry into offences under other enactments regulating the manner or place of investigation that is if an act creates an offence and regulates the manner and place of investigation or inquiry in regard to the said offence the procedure proscribed by the code of criminal procedure will give place to that provided in that act it may mean any one of the following categories of officers i a police officer who is a member of the
290	police force constituted under the police act ii though not a member of the police force constituted under the police act an officer who by statutory fiction is deemed to be a police officer in charge of a police station under the code of criminal procedure and iii an officer oh whom a statute confers powers and imposes duties of a police officer under the code of criminal procedure without describing him as a police officer or equating him by fiction to such an officer what was the meaning which the legislature intended to give to the term police officer at the time the said section was enacted that section was taken out of the criminal procedure code act of and inserted in the evidence act of as < name > in his introduction to the evidence act states at thus i may observe upon the provisions relating to them that sections and were transferred to the evidence act verbatim from the code of criminal procedure act xxv of i the legislature had in view the malpractices of police officers in extorting confessions from accused persons in order to gain credit by securing convictions and that those malpractices went to the length of positive torture nor do i doubt that the < org > in laying down such stringent rules regarded the evidence of police officers as untrustworthy and the object of the rules was to put a stop to the extortion of confession by taking the salutary principle underlying the section would apply equally to other officers by whatever designation they may be known who have the power and duty to detect the civil force to which is entrusted the duty of maintaining public order enforcing regulations for the prevention and punishment of breaches of the law and detecting crime construed as plural the members of a police force the constabulary of a locality a police officer appointed under the police act of has such powers and duties under the code of criminal procedure but they are not confined only to such police officers as the state power and duties increased manifold acts which were at one time considered to be innocuous and even praiseworthy have become offences and the police power of the state gradually began to operate on different subjects the question therefore in each case is does the officer under a particular act exercise the powers and discharge the duties of prevention and detection of crime if lie does he will be a police officer there is a conflict of judicial opinion on the question raised answering that question the learned chief justice observed at thus in construing the th section of the evidence act of i consider that the term police officer should be read not in any technical sense but according to its more comprehensive and popular meaning in common parlance and amongst the generality of people
291	the commissioner and deputy commissioner of < org > are understood to be officers of < org > or in other words police officers quite as much as the more ordinary members of the force it is true that in that case i the court was concerned with the question whether the deputy commissioner of police was a police officer this decision stood the test of time and indeed it represented the contemporaneous judicial opinion of the time < name > after considering the relevant provisions and the case law on the subject came to the following conclusion at after giving then my best attention to the arguments which have been addressed to us in my judgment we should hold that as < org > has deliberately conferred upon these abkari officers substantially all the powers of a police officer they have thereby in effect made them police officers within the meaning of < name > stated much to the same effect at it seems to me a perfectly fair interpretation of section to say that the < org > officer within the meaning of that section is an officer who exercises the powers of police conferred upon him by law whether he is called a < org > officer or he is called by any other name and exercises other functions also under other provisions of law he is a < org > officer within the meaning of section if in the investigation of offences under particular act he exercises the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence conferred upon him by that act it is true that of the bombay abkari act stated every such officer shall in the conduct of such investigation exercise the powers conferred by the code of criminal procedure upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence a full banch of < org > in < name > emperor adopted the same test for deciding whether an officer was a police officer or not < name > who delivered the leading judgment after scrutinizing the relevant provisions and the cases concluded his discussion thus at it is the nature of the duties performance of which was likely to give occasion for improper influences being exercised or felt and not any particular aversion for a particular department of public service that must have moved the legislature in enacting the provision i am therefore of opinion that if matterrs which previously did not fall within the category of crime subsequently came to be recognized as such and on that officers have been appointed to discharge or have been vested with powers of discharging duties which a police officer had to discharge in then whatever may be the name of the department to which such officers may have been attached such officers must be regarded
292	as coming within the term police officer with regard to whom section of the evidence act was intended to be applied this passage neatly summarises the law on the subject and i entirely agree with it < name > in a separate judgment came to the same conclusion and he stated at thus since not only have new off noes been created by later acts but new bodies of officers have been created who are vested with powers of police with regard to these offenses then the learned judge posed the question would that make any difference to the application of the section to these officers and answered it thus at the words police officer may be plain but they are not defined in the evidence act on the other band it is quite consistent with the scheme of the act that person who exercises the powers of a police officer should be hit by the prohibitive provision of section the learned judges held that an excise officer invested with the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for investigation of offences under a i mad < name > made the following observations at there is no exhaustive definition of the expression police officer in any of our statutes in the absence of a statutory definition and apart from all authority one would be tempted to say that a police officer is a person whom any statute or other provision of law calls such or on whom it confers all or substantially all the powers and imposes the duties of a police officer if he is expressly called a police officer there is no difficulty whatsoever if he is not so called then the next step is to ask what does the law require him to do what are the ditties imposed on him and what are the powers conferred on him if these are substantially those of a police officer there need be no qualms in regarding him as one the material thing to consider would be not the name given to him nor the colour of the uniform be is required to wear but his functions powers and duties a police officer does not cease to be such merely because he is put into a white khadder uniform instead of one in khaki drill a medicine will be just the same whether it is packaged in a glass jar or a plastic container this passage in my view lays down with clarity the real test for determining whether a particular officer is a police officer or not within the meaning of a statute that court swung to the other extreme and held that the distinction between a person who is nothing but a police officer and one who is primarily not a police officer but merely invested with the powers of a police officer is material and cannot be ignored for the purpose of construing section of the
293	evidence act on the basis of the said principle it came to the condition that an excise officer was not a police officer within the meaning of of the evidence act with at respect to the learned judges who decided that case i think that they looked too narrowly at the appearance of things and declined to look at the substance behind the appearance if that interpretation be correct an officer who is simply designated as a police officer will come under the mischief of of the evidence act whereas an officer who is not described as a police officer but who is entrusted with all the police powers and duties would not be hit by it in coming to that conclusion the learned judge distinguished a decision of a division bench of < org > on the ground that the ordinance on which that decision turned specifically mentioned that in conducting the investigation particular officers would have all the powers duties privileges and liabilities of an officer in charge of a police station under the criminal procedure code i do not see how that circumstance makes a difference in the application of of the evidence act the fact that that ordinance by reference to the code of criminal procedure conferred powers on the commercial tax officers but the sea < org > act conferred similar powers not by reference to any code but by express enactment could not make any difference in the application of the principle i shall consider at a later stage the scope of the powers conferred by the sea < org > act on a < org > officer in the matter of prevention detection and investigation of crimes though powers of prevention and detection were conferred on a < org > officer no powers of investigation was given to him i shall consider this aspect at a later stage if a literal meaning is given to the term police officer indicating thereby an officer designated as police officer it will lead to anomalous results an officer designated as a police officer even though he does not discharge the well understood police functions will be hit by of the evidence act whereas an officer not so designated but who has all the powers of a police officer would not be hit by that section with the result the object of the section would be defeated the intermediate position namely that an officer can be a police officer only if powers and duties pertaining to an officer in charge of a police station within the meaning of the code of criminal procedure are entrusted to him would also lead to an equally anomalous position for it would exclude from its operation a case of an officer on whom specific powers and functions are conferred under specific statutes without reference to the code of criminal procedure a police officer within the meaning of of the evidence act may be defined thus an officer by whatever designation he is
294	called on whom a statute substantially confers the powers and imposes the duties of the police is a police officer within the meaning of of the evidence act section of the sea < org > act opens out with the following words the offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively chapter xvi of the act deals with offences and penalties the first column gives the particulars of offences the second column gives the section to which the offence has reference and the third column gives the penalties in respect of each offence chapter xvii prescribes the procedure relating to offences appeals etc section confers on an officer of < org > duly employed in the prevention of smuggling the power to search on reasonable suspicion any person on board of any vessel in any port in india or within the indian customs waters or any person who has landed from any vessel section empowers such officer to board a vessel for searching it an order to ascertain whether any breach of the act or any other law relating to customs has been or is being or is likely to be committed section a which was inserted by act of gives power to the said officer to summon persons to give evidence and produce documents presumably to facilitate investigation of the offence the said sections therefore create offences and for the purpose of prevention and detection of such offences confer specific powers on the < org > officers to search persons or places to arrest persons suspected of such offences and to make necessary investigation in respect thereof the < org > officers under the act have the powers and they also discharge the functions of police officers and therefore they are police officers for the purpose of the evidence act in so far as they exercise or discharge such powers and functions if so it follows that a confession made to him cannot be proved against a person accused of an offence in the present case it is not disputed that if the confession made by the respondent to the < org > officers was excluded there would be no other evidence on which the conviction could be sustained [SEP]
295	[CLS] when the police party proceeded towards < name > house they saw two young men coming from the opposite side on a motorcycle < org > by order dated disposed of the petition with an observation that petitioners may file a criminal complaint in a competent court the petitioner published a notice in < org > dated that he had disowned his son < name > and was not responsible for his actions the petitioner sent an undated letter to this court received on wherein he alleged that < name > in charge of < org > along with some < org > officers came to his house on at about a to enquire about the whereabouts of his son < name > and that when he informed them that he was not aware of it they started beating him thereafter the < org > took him his wife and two minor daughters forcibly to the < org > post through the bazaar he also alleged that the < org > forced him to bring money for the vehicles to conduct raids to catch his son < name > and he was forced to accompany them on such raids and was put in wooden shikanza at tulvan thana when he begged that he should be released he was informed that he was being taken for the raids on the instructions of < name > jind and that without the permission of the he could not be released the petitioner alleged that his friends and relatives who wanted to meet him when he was being illegally detained were not permitted to meet him and they were also tortured he prayed for a direction to the < org > to stop the atrocities and torture according to < org > on the sho < org > station garhi along with other police officials visited the house of petitioner in search of < name > who had escaped from custody the petitioner filed an affidavit dated before this court on alleging interrogation by < org > on and in regard to escape of his son < name > from < org > custody a further affidavit was filed by the petitioner on wherein he alleged that his younger son < name > was forcibly taken from his sister house on and tortured this brought forth a further affidavit dated from the < name > by way of reply denying the allegations not being satisfied with the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the < org > in regard to the letter petition this court on directed the chief secretary of the < org > of haryana to file a detailed affidavit in regard to the steps taken on the allegations made by the petitioner he submitted a report dated stating that the allegations of the
296	petitioner relating to police torture illegal detention harassment to wife and daughters and removal of cash licensed weapon jewellery were not substantiated not being satisfied with the said report this court on directed the < org > to inquire into the matter with reference to the allegations made in the letter as also the subsequent affidavits filed by the petitioner and his relatives and the reply affidavits filed by the respondents the findings in the said report are arrived at on the basis of the allegations made in the affidavits filed before this court and the statements made by the petitioner his family members and others nearly witnesses before the inquiry officer on this court directed that the state government to take appropriate action on the report of the < org > this court also took note of the submission of the amicus curiae that in such cases apart from < org > inquiry and criminal prosecution compensation has to be awarded to the victims and the submission of the < org > that having regard to the facts of the case and having regard to the registration of the fir the matter may have to await the result of the prosecution while adjourning the case this court observed that the question of awarding any compensation at that stage did not arise the findings contained in the report of < org > are summarized below allegations by petitioner and his relatives finding by i note however in the writ petition filed by < name > and petitioner on in < org > it is alleged that petitioner and < name > were kept in illegal confinement from to and again from to there is no allegation of any torture at all the report further shows that petitioner was involved in several criminal cases from and his son < name > was involved in more number of criminal cases from the year as detailed below cases in respect of petitioner no and above on and sentenced to undergo ri for six years and two years respectively position emerging from the records cbi report arguments a careful examination of the facts lead to the following inferences i all allegations relating to petitioner and his family members being taken to < org > stations < org > posts and being questioned beaten up tortured are in connection with the effort of < org > to find the whereabouts of < name > whenever he was involved in a serious incident that is a incident on when joginder was suspected of killing a < org > constable incident on when joginder escaped from < org > custody when he was being taken to court and incident on when joginder was suspected of killing two persons at tohana ii though there is some evidence of illegal detention and beating of petitioner and his relatives the allegations of custodial torture are exaggerated and
297	to a certain extent false iii there is no medical evidence nor any visible scars marks disability resulting from the alleged torture either in the case of petitioner or his family members relatives we will next refer to the factors which indicate that petitioner and his relatives have made false and exaggerated claims in regard to illegal detention torture etc but in the writ petition filed by petitioner and < name > in < org > on it is alleged that the petitioner and < name > were confined by < org > between and three days and again for a day between and but in the writ petition filed in < org > on by petitioner and < name > there is no allegation of beating or torture but only expression of an apprehension that they may be arrested harassed and tortured note petitioner blames his counsel for not mentioning the facts properly in the writ petition filed before < org > in the letter petition petitioner completely suppressed the fact that he along with < name > had filed a writ petition on in < org > in regard to the said incident between to and the fact that the said writ petition was disposed of on by < org > reserving liberty to file a criminal complaint he even published a notice in < org > in august stating that he has no connection with his son < name > in his affidavit dated filed in this case on petitioner reiterates that he has disowned his son < name > and alleges that he did not have any contact with him and that in spite of it the police were continuously harassing him and his family members seeking information about the whereabouts of < name > and raiding his house and his relatives houses to find out whether < name > was hiding there petitioner was traveling to meet his son < name > whenever he was being produced in courts in respect of different cases in fact petitioner received money from < org > tohana kacchi union of which he was a member to meet the expenses of the travel to meet his son on and further the jail records showed that < name > was met by petitioner wife on petitioner brother < name > on and petitioner uncle < name > on and petitioner brother in law < name > on there was thus reasonable cause for the < org > to think that the family members of < name > might know about his whereabouts the report of the < org > shows that there is prima facie evidence about petitioner and some of his relatives being illegally detained in < org > station post and subjected possibly to some third degree methods to extract information regarding the whereabouts of < name > singh this leads us
298	to the question whether in addition to directing < org > inquiry and prosecution of the officers concerned on the facts and circumstances of this case compensation should be awarded to petitioner and his family members as a public law remedy for the violation of their fundamental rights under article of the constitution though illegal detention and custodial torture were recognized as violations of the fundamental rights of life and liberty guaranteed under article to begin with only the following reliefs were being granted in writ petitions under article or a direction to set at liberty the person detained if the complaint was one of illegal detention direction to the concerned < org > to hold an inquiry and take action against the officers responsible for the violation in the bhagalpur blinding case < name > ii vs state of bihar scc < name > as he then was speaking for the bench posed the following question while considering the relief that could be given by a court for violation of constitutional rights guaranteed in article of the constitution but if life or personal liberty is violated otherwise than in accordance with such procedure is the court helpless to grant relief to the person who has suffered such deprivation why should the court not be prepared to forge new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating the most precious of the precious fundamental right to life and personal liberty the question was expanded in a subsequent order in bhagalpur blinding case < name > iv vs state of bihar scc thus if an officer of the < org > acting in his official capacity threatens to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty without the authority of law can such person not approach the court for injuncting the < org > from acting through such officer in violation of his fundamental right under article can the < org > urge in defence in such a case that it is not infringing the fundamental right of the petitioner under article because the officer who is threatening to do so is acting outside the law and therefore beyond the scope of his authority and hence the < org > is not responsible for his action would this not make a mockery of article and reduce it to nullity a mere rope of sand for on this view if the officer is acting according to law there would ex concessionis be no breach of article and if he is acting without the authority of law the < org > would be able to contend that it is not responsible for his action and therefore there is no violation of article so also if there is any threatened invasion by the < org > of the fundamental right guaranteed under article the
299	petitioner who is aggrieved can move the court under article for a writ injuncting such threatened invasion and if there is any continuing action of the < org > which is violative of the fundamental right under article the petitioner can approach the court under article and ask for a writ striking down the continuance of such action but where the action taken by the < org > has already resulted in breach of the fundamental right under article by deprivation of some limb of the petitioner would the petitioner have no remedy under article for breach of the fundamental right guaranteed to him would the court permit itself to become helpless spectator of the violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner by the < org > and tell the petitioner that though the constitution has guaranteed the fundamental right to him and has also given him the fundamental right of moving the court for enforcement of his fundamental right the court cannot give him any relief answering the said questions it was held that when a court trying the writ petition proceeds to inquire into the violation of any right to life or personal liberty while in police custody it does so not for the purpose of adjudicating upon the guilt of any particular officer with a view to punishing him but for the purpose of deciding whether the fundamental right of the petitioners under article has been violated and the < org > is liable to pay compensation to them for such violation this < org > further clarified that in a given case if the investigation is still proceeding the < org > may even defer the inquiry before it until the investigation is completed or if the < org > considered it necessary in the interests of justice it may postpone its inquiry until after the prosecution was terminated but that is a matter entirely for the exercise of the discretion of the < org > and there is no bar precluding the < org > from proceeding with the inquiry before it even if the investigation or prosecution is pending he was released from jail only on after years and sought compensation for his illegal detention this court while recognizing that article cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary processes of courts civil and criminal raised for consideration the important question as to whether in the exercise of its jurisdiction under article this court can pass an order for payment of money as compensation for the deprivation of a fundamental right this court answered the question thus while awarding compensation article which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this court were limited to passing orders of release from illegal detention one of the telling ways in
300	which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of article secured is to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt the right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the < org > as a shield if civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well known to suffer mention it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy therefore the < org > must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner rights it may have recourse against those officers the next day his dead body was found on a railway track this court awarded compensation to the mother of the deceased < name > as he then was spelt out the following principles award of compensation in a proceeding under article by this < org > or by the high < org > under article of the constitution is a remedy available in public law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort enforcement of the constitutional right and grant of redress embraces award of compensation as part of the legal consequences of its contravention a claim in public law for compensation for contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms the protection of which is guaranteed in the constitution is an acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection of such rights and such a claim based on strict liability made by resorting to a constitutional remedy provided for the enforcement of a fundamental right is distinct from and in addition to the remedy in private law for damages for the tort resulting from the contravention of the fundamental right it is this principle which justifies award of monetary compensation for contravention of fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution when that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention made by the < org > or its servants in the purported exercise of their powers and enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by resort to the remedy in public law under the constitution by recourse to articles and of the constitution emphasis supplied dr a anand as he then was in his concurring judgment elaborated the principle thus convicts prisoners or under trials are not denuded of their fundamental rights under article and it is only such restrictions as are permitted by law which can
301	be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights by such persons it is an obligation of the < org > to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible rights of a citizen to life except in accordance with law while the citizen is in its custody the public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings the purpose of public law is not only to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights therefore when the court moulds the relief by granting compensation in proceedings under article or seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights it does so under the public law by way of penalizing the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the < org > which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen the payment of compensation in such cases is not to be understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an order of making monetary amends under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of public duty of not protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen the compensation is in the nature of exemplary damages awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of its public law duty and is independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under the private law in an action based on tort through a suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or and prosecute the offender under the penal law this court held custodial violence including torture and death in the lock ups strikes a blow at the rule of law which demands that the powers of the executive should not only be derived from law but also that the same should be limited by law it is aggravated by the fact that it is committed by persons who are supposed to be the protectors of the citizens it is committed under the shield of uniform and authority in the four walls of a police station or lock up the victim being totally helpless any form of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would fall within the inhibition of article of the constitution whether it occurs during investigation interrogation or otherwise if the functionaries of the < org > become law breakers it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to become law unto himself thereby leading to anarchy does a citizen shed off his fundamental right to life the moment a policeman arrests him can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance on his arrest police is no doubt under a
302	legal duty and has legitimate right to arrest a criminal and to interrogate him during the investigation of an offence but it must be remembered that the law does not permit use of third degree methods or torture of accused in custody during interrogation and investigation with a view to solve the crime end cannot justify the means by torturing a person and using third degree methods the police would be accomplishing behind the closed doors what the demands of our legal order forbid no society can permit it award of such compensation by way of public law remedy will not come in the way of the aggrieved person claiming additional compensation in a civil court in enforcement of the private law remedy in tort nor come in the way of the criminal court ordering compensation under section of code of civil procedure this takes us to the next question as to whether compensation should be awarded under article for every violation of article where illegal detention or custodial violence is alleged whether compensation should be awarded for every violation of article he can in that event seek remedial assistance under article the power of the court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases we are deliberately using the words in appropriate cases because we must make it clear that it is not in every case where there is a breach of a fundamental right committed by the violator that compensation would be awarded by the court in a petition under article the infringement of the fundamental right must be gross and patent that is incontrovertible and ex facie glaring and either such infringement should be on a large scale affecting the fundamental rights of a large number of persons or it should appear unjust or unduly harsh or oppressive on account of their poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to require the person or persons affected by such infringement to initiate and pursue act in the civil courts ordinarily of course a petition under article should not be used as a substitute for enforcement of the right to claim compensation for infringement of a fundamental right through the ordinary process of civil court emphasis supplied in nilabati behera supra this < org > put in a word of caution thus of course relief in exercise of the power under article or would be granted only when it is established that there has been an infringement of the fundamental rights of the citizen and no other form of appropriate redressal by the court in the facts and circumstances of the case is possible law is in the process of development and the process necessitates developing separate public law procedures as also public law principles it may be necessary to identify the situations to which separate proceedings and principles apply and the courts have to act firmly but with certain amount
303	of circumspection and self restraint lest proceedings under article or are misused as a disguised substitute for civil action in private law this court also drew attention to the following aspect there is one other aspect also which needs our consideration we are conscious of the fact that the police in india have to perform a difficult and delicate task particularly in view of the deteriorating law and order situation communal riots political turmoil student unrest terrorist activities and among others the increasing number of underworld and armed gangs and criminals many hard core criminals like extremists the terrorists drug peddlers smugglers who have organized gangs have taken strong roots in the society it is being said in certain quarters that with more and more liberalization and enforcement of fundamental rights it would lead to difficulties in the detection of crimes committed by such categories of hardened criminals by soft peddling interrogation it is felt in those quarters that if we lay too much of emphasis on protection of their fundamental rights and human rights such criminals may go scot free without exposing any element or iota of criminality with the result the crime would go unpunished and in the ultimate analysis the society would suffer this is all the more so in view of the expectation of the society that police must deal with the criminals in an efficient and effective manner and bring to book those who are involved in the crime scc this court warned against non genuine claims but at the same time there seems to be a disturbing trend of increase in cases where false accusations of custodial torture are made trying to take advantage of the serious concern shown and the stern attitude reflected by the courts while dealing with custodial violence it needs to be carefully examined whether the allegations of custodial violence are genuine or are sham attempts to gain undeserved benefit masquerading as victims of custodial violence we have come to the conclusion that < name > and < name > had been illegally detained by respondents to from the afternoon of to the < org > must be held responsible for the unlawful acts of its officers and it must repair the damage done to the citizens by its officers for violating their indivisible fundamental right of personal liberty without any authority of law in an absolutely high handed manner we would have been therefore inclined to direct the < org > government of haryana to compensate < name > and < name > but since < name > has indulged in false hood in this court and < name > has also exaggerated the incident by stating that on when he was way laid along with < name
304	> and < name > advocate two employees of respondents and were also present with the police party which version has not been found to be correct by the < org > they both have disentitled themselves from receiving any compensation as monetary amends for the wrong done by respondents to in detaining them we therefore do not direct the payment of any compensation to them cases where violation of article involving custodial death or torture is established or is incontrovertible stand on a different footing when compared to cases where such violation is doubtful or not established where there is no independent evidence of custodial torture and where there is neither medical evidence about any injury or disability resulting from custodial torture nor any mark scar it may not be prudent to accept claims of human right violation by persons having criminal records in a routine manner for awarding compensation while custodial torture is not infrequent it should be borne in mind that every arrest and detention does not lead to custodial torture in cases where custodial death or custodial torture or other violation of the rights guaranteed under article is established courts may award compensation in a proceeding under article or however before awarding compensation the < org > will have to pose to itself the following questions a whether the violation of article is patent and incontrovertible whether the violation is gross and of a magnitude to shock the conscience of the court whether the custodial torture alleged has resulted in death or whether custodial torture is supported by medical report or visible marks or scars or disability where there is no evidence of custodial torture of a person except his own statement and where such allegation is not supported by any medical report or other corroboration evidence or where there are clear indications that the allegations are false or exaggerated fully or in part courts may not award compensation as a public law remedy under article or but relegate the aggrieved party to the traditional remedies by way of appropriate civil criminal action we should not however be understood as holding that harassment and custodial violence is not serious or worthy of consideration where there is no medical report or visible marks or independent evidence the exaggerated adherence to and insistence upon the establishment of proof beyond every reasonable doubt by the prosecution ignoring the ground realities the fact situations and the peculiar circumstances of a given case in the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged tortures in police custody which of late are on the increase receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach of the < org > because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them if an odd prisoner dies in the lock up because there would
305	hardly be any evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture unfortunately police in the country have given room for an impression in the minds of public that whenever there is a crime investigation usually means rounding up all persons concerned say all servants in the event of a theft in the employer house or all acquaintances of the deceased in the event of a murder and subjecting them to third degree interrogation in the hope that someone will spill the beans police are branded as inefficient even when there is a short delay in catching the culprits in serious crimes effort should be made to remove the very causes which lead to custodial violence so as to prevent such occurances an independent investigating agency preferably the respective < org > or < org > may be entrusted with adequate power to investigate complaints of custodial violence against police personnel and take stern and speedy action followed by prosecution wherever necessary in this case there is no clear or incontrovertible evidence about custodial torture nor any medical report of any injury or disability the law will have to take own course this order will not come in the way of any civil court awarding compensation in an action in tort or the criminal court awarding compensation under section cpc in the pending prosecution against any of the officers if the charges are established we record our appreciation for the effort put in by < name > amicus curiae in presenting the matter [SEP]
306	[CLS] this is an application by the sholapur municipality against the order of the learned district judge of sholapur purporting to act under section of the bombay city municipalities act xviii of and directing the sholapur municipality to pay compensation for square feet at the rate of rs per square foot to opponent no < name > alone and holding that opponent no < name > mortgage was vitiated by the doctrine of lis pendens inasmuch as he took the mortgage with notice of a prior agreement by the owner with tuljaram during the pendency of a suit by the latter the arbitrators gave an award allowing rs < name > then made the present application to the district court demanding the amount as determined by the panchas and prayed for an order compelling the municipality to pay the amount due to the applicant at rs the learned district judge held that at the time when the negotiations were going on and when the panchayat was constituted the intention of the < org > was to acquire an area of square feet in order to open up and widen the roads in the locality that it was impossible to say that the applicant acceptance of the rate fixed by the panchas was not induced by the consideration of the resulting improvements to his remaining property and that it was not open to the < org > to withdraw from the acquisition of square feet and that the award was binding on both the parties not only in respect of the rate but also in respect of the area it is urged on behalf of the municipality that the application made by tuljaram for compelling the municipality to pay compensation for the whole of the land is not warranted by any of the provisions of section of the bombay city municipalities act and therefore < org > had no jurisdiction to entertain the application and the order passed by < org > is a nullity and should be set aside under sub section either party if dissatisfied with the decision of the panchayat may apply to < org > which shall determine the matter in accordance with sub section i according to the procedure prescribed by the land acquisition act in the present case the panchayat gave the decision in favour of tuljaram and it cannot be said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the panch under sub section the < org > has power after the award has been made by the panchayat or < org > to take possession of the land after paying the amount of compensation to the party to whom such compensation may be payable and if the party
307	refuses to accept such compensation or it there is no person competent to alienate the land or if there is any dispute as to the title to the compensation or as to the apportionment the < org > may deposit the amount of the compensation in < org > it is clear from the provisions of section that the application made by tuljaram to < org > to compel the < org > to pay compensation for the whole land is not maintainable under any of the provisions of the section it appears that the section has failed to make provision for compelling the < org > to pay the amount determined by the panchayat though provision has been made in favour of the < org > to take possession of the property after paying compensation to the party entitled to it or depositing it in court it is therefore clear that < org > had no jurisdiction in this case to entertain the application made by < name > it had also no jurisdiction to determine the right of opponent no < name > who was a mortgagee from the predecessor in title of < name > < org > therefore clearly had no jurisdiction to decide the question submitted for its consideration and the decision is null and aoid the next question is whether < org > has power to interfere with the order of < org > act iii of which corresponds to section of the bombay city municipalities act that though a right of appeal is given by section of the land acquisition act no appeal is provided by section of the bombay district municipal act corresponding to section of the bombay city municipalities act and that the order of < org > is not a decree because it is made not under the ordinary civil jurisdiction but under the special jurisdiction created by the special act in that case it was held that as no appeal lay from the decision of the that though the words occurring in section are < org > the distinction was not sufficient to support an application for revision to < org > in < name > < name > it was held that a district judge acting under section of the bombay district municipal act was not a court within the meaning of the word in section of the civil procedure code corresponding to a of the present code and < org > had no jurisdiction to revise his order and it was held that a district judge as distinguished from < org > is a persona designata it was held by < org > that an order made by < org > under section of the religious endowments act was an order revisable by the high < org
308	> under section of the civil procedure code reference was made to the decision in the case of < name > < name > and the decision that the district judge was a persona designata under section of the bombay district municipal act was held to be correct on the ground that the district judge was a persona designata for a specific purpose and not an officer exercising judicial functions under the act but it was held that under the religious endowments act < org > was not a persona designata but a civil < org > exercising jurisdiction under the act the case went on appeal to < org > in < name > < name > i a bom where it was observed by their lordships of < org > moreover it is to < org > and not to the individual judge who may preside in or constitute < org > that jurisdiction is given the decision in the case of < name > was referred to in the madras case which went up to < org > and the remark of their lordships appears to have been made in reference to the designation of the person who had to decide an election under section of the municipal act as a district judge as distinguished from < org > their lordships of < org > confirmed the view of < org > that < org > under section of the religious endowments act xx of empowering a civil < org > to fill up the vacancy in < org > was acting in a judicial capacity as a < org > and not merely in an administrative capacity and that though no appeal lay under the civil procedure code from such an order the matter in which the order of < org > was made was a case within the meaning of section of the civil procedure code it appears therefore that where a judge or the presiding officer of a < org > as distinguished from the < org > itself is directed to perform any function of an authority created by a statute such a judge may be considered as a persona designata and not a < org > but where a civil < org > subordinate to the high < org > is constituted an authority to decide the rights between the parties and is directed to perform judicial functions it is difficult to hold that such a < org > is a persona designata and not a < org > subordinate to the high < org > in < org > postmaster general a it was held that < org > which as regards england consisted of one ex officio and two appointed < org > e
309	##rs was established as < org > and an appeal lay from the < org > to < org > except upon questions of fact and locus standi where by statute matters are referred to the determination of a < org > of record with no further provision the necessary implication is i think that the < org > will determine the matters as a < org > the question was fully discussed by the full bench of < org > in < org > < name > i ram the question therefore is whether the < org > which decides the rights between the parties according to the provisions of any statute is a subordinate < org > and reference is made to the district < org > the district < org > under sub sections and has to act according to the procedure provided by the land acquisition act of it was held that no appeal lay to < org > from the order passed by the district judge as persona designata under a scheme for management of a charitable institution but at page it was observed as follows we are not concerned with hypothetical oases which have been suggested be us such as the district judge declining to exercise the functions imposed upon him by the scheme or in the exercise of those functions entirely failing to exercise any discretion in the matter when such oases arise we have no doubt that < org > will be competent to deal with them i would therefore set aside the order of the lower court it was agreed between the parties that square feet should be acquired and as the municipality considered that the compensation demanded by tuljaram was exorbitant the matter was referred to arbitration as provided by section of act xviii of the area to be acquired was not settled by the panchas because at the time there was no dispute on that point but afterwards the municipality changed its mind and proposed to acquire square feet only at the same rate per square foot per square foot for the whole area and that the compensation should be paid to < name > and payment was ordered accordingly a preliminary question arises as to whether the application is competent that is to say whether < org > has any power to revise the order of < org > purporting to have been made under section of act xviii of section of the civil procedure coda gives power to < org > to revise the proceedings of any < org > subordinate to < org > in a case in which no appeal lies of the code provides as follows in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary nothing in this code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any
310	special or local law now in force or any special jurisdiction or power conferred or any special form of procedure prescribed by or under any other law for the time being in force this has been interpreted to mean that the provisions of the code apply to proceedings under special acts unless there is some provision in the special act which shows a contrary intention was a case under the madras rent recovery act which contained an express provision that orders passed under it should not be liable to revision except by < org > there is no provision in act xviii of such as there was in the act dealt with in < name > < name > which excludes the revisional jurisdiction of < org > it would appear therefore that section must apply and give this < org > power to revise the order of the district judge if it can be regarded as an order of a < org > subordinate to < org > then there is section of the government of india act which gives < org > powers of superintendence over all < org > subject to its appellate jurisdiction the power of superintendence here referred to includes the power of revision < name > < name > i cal therefore has power to revise the order in question under section of the government of india act if it is an order of a < org > normally subject to the appellate jurisdiction of < org > that in the present case we are concerned with an order of a < org > is clear from the language of section under clause the district judge is given power to appoint arbitrators in certain circumstances but when it is a question of the determination of any dispute between the parties whether on failure of the panchayat to give a decision clause or in case either party is dissatisfied with the decision of the panchayat clause it is the district < org > which is empowered to deal with the matter and the procedure to be followed is that laid down in the land acquisition act for proceedings referred for the determination of the < org > and < name > king emperor where it was held respectively that the high < org > has no power to revise the orders of a district registrar a rent collector under the rangoon rent act a district judge acting departmentally as the head of an office and a commissioner appointed under the defence of india act has little or no application in the present case lastly section of the code provides in terms that the district < org > is subordinate to the high < org > for the purposes of the code the difficulty arises owing to the
311	decision in < org > < name > where it was held that no application for revision lies against the decision of < org > under clause of section of the bombay district municipal act iii of which corresponds to clause of section of the present act the first point to be noted in connection with this case is that the application had been properly made to < org > under clause of section it is true that the judge in that casehe happened to be an assistant judgedid not decide the dispute because he was of opinion that he had no jurisdiction to do so until certain other matters had first been submitted to arbitration it was not a case like the present where < org > was applied to for an order which it was not empowered to makethere is nothing in section which gives < org > power to enforce an award on the application of a party who relies upon itand where moreover the < org > has determined a dispute viz such a decision would in our opinion be seriously anomalous and we do not think that the words of the statute require us to make such a pronouncement the only decision which seems to us fairly consistent with that already recorded in < name > case is the decision that no application for revision is competent in < name > < name > this < org > has held that it has no jurisdiction to revise the order of a district judge acting under section of the bombay district municipalities act of and although the words occurring in that section are district judge whereas the words occurring in section last clause are district < org > we do not think that the distinction is sufficient to support the argument that an application for revision is competent although admittedly no appeal would lie in < name > case it was decided that no appeal lies from the decision of < org > under clause of section of the bombay district municipal act the fact that there is no appeal does not ordinarily imply that there is no remedy by revision either in fact revision only lies under section of the code in cases where there is no appeal so that evidently what < name > meant when he said that any other decision would be seriously anomalous was this viz that the particular grounds on which it had been decided that there was no appeal would apply equally in the case of a revision application a subsidiary ground was that in < name > < name > it was decided that < org > had no jurisdiction to revise the order of a district judge under section of the bombay district municipal act of on the ground that the district judge was not a < org > but
312	a persona designata < name > apparently considered that it made no material difference whether the powers under a special act were assigned to the district judge or to the district < org > < org > made an order determining the amount and the applicant appealed < name > view was that < org > only came in as a substitute for the panchayat where adjudication by the latter had failed and therefore < org > order could not be questioned any more than the award of the panchayat could be questioned by way of an appeal the learned judge also referred to the provisos to section clause which are the same as the provisos to section clause of the present act namely a no application to the collector for a reference shall be necessary and the court shall have full power to give and apportion the costs of all proceedings in any manner it thinks fit this so far as i can see is the only reason in the judgment which can in any way be said to negative the power of < org > to revise < org > order the additional reason given for holding that there was no appeal namely that the order could not be regarded as a decree would not affect the question of revision at all now if the decision in this case is to be considered not with reference to the question which was decided in the case itself namely the question whether there was an appeal but with reference to the question whether a revision application lies there are two important points of difference which i think must affect the decision it can only be made executable apparently by being filed as a decree as provided by the civil procedure code or by means of a suit to enforce it it would be impossible to hold that the < org > was functioning simply as a substitute for the panchayat when it dealt with matters not referred to the panchayat at all as regards < name > < name > that was a case under the bombay district municipal act section of which act empowered the district judge to pass an order for confirming or amending the declared result of an election or for setting the election aside it was this order for payment of costs which < org > was asked to revise and it was held that the district judge acting under section was not a court and that < org > could not interfere in the first place the powers under section of the act of were given to the district judge and not to < org > [SEP]
313	[CLS] the petitioners in this writ petition numbering have challenged the quashing of the demand made by the respondent dda vide their letter of demand received by the petitioners in september it has been further alleged by the petitioners that the draw of lot held on st august for the said category of registrants the < org > has demanded in dilshad garden east delhi for mig flats on ground floor rupees according to the petitioners there is no justification for the < org > to ask more price in for the same category of registration at a higher price than those stated above on the other hand learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the petitioners had to wait for years when < org > allotted flats to them the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners vehemently argued that respondent authority is constituted under the act of parliament for providing amongst other things housing to the population of metropolitan city of delhi at no profit no loss basis according to the petitioners the above clause was limited to the right of the respondent authority to revise and modify terms and conditions depending upon the exigencies of layout cost of construction but will not encompass in its fold power to disregard the scheme altogether and make exhorbitant demand as has been done in this case respondent < org > has argued that in view of clause of the brochure < org > reserves its right to alter any terms and conditions in its discretion as and when considered necessary according to them the prices demanded are totally reasonable and there is nothing unreasonable about the same it is further argued by learned counsel for < org > that on account of tremendous rush under the scheme a priority list was prepared according to which flats were allotted from time to time as per draw of lots according to seniority list the stand of the < org > is that prices of the flats have been arrived at after meticulous calculations and after taking into consideration all relevant considerations and there is nothing arbitrary or irrational about the same counsel for the < org > has also relied upon < org > < name > and has argued that on that basis once the petitioner willingly enters into a contract with the public authority fully aware with the terms and conditions the petitioners are estopped from challenging the terms and conditions of the contract lastly respondent has also contended that in view of clause of the brochure wherein some of the areas where construction was likely to be undertaken or flats were constructed were mentioned that would not create a bar for construction being undertaken in other areas it is in this background that we have to examine the facts of this
314	case the land in delhi has been acquired by < org > from time to time there is an averment by the petitioner in the present case that the land was acquired by < org > much prior to the induction of scheme of where the flats have been constructed time and again we asked the counsel for < org > to tell us as to when the land in question was acquired where the petitioners are being allotted respective flats nothing was made available before us to indicate that the land was acquired in or or thereafter or any period earlier to that we are discussing this aspect in order to understand the basis on which the < org > has enhanced the prices of flats in question there are three essential components which may have bearing in escalation of cost the land rate which includes cost of acquisition future cost and additional price which state has to incur on account of enhancement of compensation cost of construction and cost of administrative expenses which may include profit to the contractor if it is to be constructed by the outside agency particularly speaking these are the basic cost which are essential for determining the fixation of price apart from other incidental cost which may not vary the cost to a large extent the petitioners have filed the rejoinder in which specific instances were given which are a mr < name > registered under the same scheme called new pattern registration scheme nprs it may be stated that the area of rohini is a much better locality as compared to jahangirpuri and some other areas where flats have been offered to the petitioners a flat offered to the petitioner on rd floor in the area of jahangirpuri is for rs mr < name > requested that a flat could be allotted to him somewhere in north delhi by demand dated the flat was then offered to mr < name > for rupees the < org > was afforded an opportunity to file additional affidavit to explain the circumstances under which aforesaid flats have been allotted but nothing substantial was filed to controvert what has been stated by the petitioner except that meticulous calculations were taken into consideration according to the < org > the revision in land rate was well considered policy decision and there is nothing arbitrary or illegal about the same it is not for us in normal course to go through the policy regarding fixation of land rate or land premium but in the instant case fixation of land rate by the < org > is so arbitrary and without any basis that we have to discuss this in detail this also finds corroboration from page of the paper book where in relation to ground floor flat in jahangi
315	##rpuri the land rate has been shown at the rate of rs we fail to understand that when initially the < org > in the brochure has estimated cost to be worked out as rs for mig category this estimated cost obviously had taken into account all possible items of expenses including the land which had been acquired cost of construction and other administrative expenses no material whatsoever in spite of our insistence as to what were the factors which were taken into consideration by lt that will make mockery of law secondly even though the construction of the flats may have been delayed on account of disputes between the respondent and the contractor but the amounts so spent on account of delay of construction was totally not passed on to the petitioners thirdly according to the learned counsel for the respondent no allottee could claim that he has an entitlement to a particular set of land rate which was prevailing at different times we are afraid that this proposition cannot be of any help to the respondent as in that case the challenge was to a surcharge levied by the < org > as part of purchase price of the flat and petitioners before < org > were already allotted flats and < org > observed in that case that the real purpose of the petitioners to file the petition before < org > was to get back a part of the purchase price of the flats paid by the petitioners after flats have been secured by them therefore < org > in paragraph thus observed even if there may be any merit in this contention though there is none such a relief of refund cannot be the subject matter of a petition under article concerning for this submission that the authority has the trappings of a < org > or would be comprehended in other authority for the purpose of article while determining price of flats constructed by it it acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations which dealings of the < org > with the individual citizens import into every transaction entered into in the exercise of its constitutional powers but after the < org > or its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract the relations are no longer governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se or of any other constitutional provision when the < org > or its agents purporting to act within this field perform any act in this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in and confers some special statutory power or obligation on the < org > in the contractual field which is
316	apart from contract petitioners were under no obligation to seek allotment of flats even after they had registered themselves they looked at the price and flats and applied for the flats each one of them was allotted a flat and he paid the price voluntarily they are now trying to wriggle out by an invidious method so as to get back a part of the purchase price not offering to return the benefit under the contract namely surrender of flat possession of the fiat is taken and price is paid at a later stage when they are secure in possession with title petitioners are trying to get back a part of the purchase price and thus trying to reopen and wriggle out of a concluded contract only partially has observed that those who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along with its benefits reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon whether a contracting party findings its prudent to abide by the terms of the contract by such a test no contract would ever have a binding force however as the petitions were heard on merits the contentions canvassed on behalf of the petitioners may as well be examined what is forbidden by art is discrimination amongst persons of the same class and for the purposes of allotment of flats scheme wise allottees of flats in the same scheme not different schemes in the same income bricket will have each such class there is unequal treatment or unreasonable or arbitrary treatment the complaint that art according to the petitioners before < org > there was another scheme of mig fiats munirka where allotment took place at and about the same time where no surcharge was levied these authorities do not help the case of the respondents as < org > was considering the validity of notification dated regarding prices fixed for various grades of sugar with reference to geographical cum agro econo mic consideration and average cost profiles of factories located in respective zones < org > further laid down that judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for conclusions reached by concerned authority from the aforesaid observations in < org > case supra it is dear that the scope of judicial review in cases like the present one relating to fixation of price is limited but as stated earlier it would be only when it is found that there is a rational basis for the conclusion reached by < org > for fixation of price as has been done in the instant case in our opinion the respondent authority had no basis for arriving at the rates fixed what to talk of rational basis in this case < org > was dealing with case of fixation of price under the essential
317	commodities act where the ultimate interest of the consumers was the primary consideration for upholding the order of fixation of prices of essential commodities learned counsel for the petitioners also cited < org > < org > all er and house of lord cases in support of his proposition this authority is of no help to the case of the respondent as < org > was examining altogether different issue involved in the matter the petitioner has entered into a contract with < org > being fully aware of the terms and conditions of the contract before dealing with < org > case we would like to mention the brief facts of < name > case in this regard no assurance was given to any registrants that he will be allotted a flat on hire purchase basis the learned counsel overlooked the fact that < org > for short < org > dealt with cases where allottees after voluntarily accepting the conditions imposed by the < org > have entered into the realm of contract purely and simple with the < org > and hence allottees could only claim the right conferred upon them by the said contract and was bound by the terms of the contract in the < org > case the note given in the brochure clearly stated that the cost shown therein is only an estimated cost and would increase or decrease in the price only at the time of completion of the house flat many persons got themselves registered for allotment of flats houses it was in these circumstances that < org > held that it was in the realm of contract pure and simple more so the petitioner before < org > was highly educated and has accepted the revised terms of the < org > therefore and he was not entitled to any relief as the contract entered into between the < org > and the persons aggrieved was non statutory and purely contractual and therefore the rights were governed only by the terms of the contract no notice was issued to the petitioners informing them of the revision of prices no acceptance was asked for by the < org > from the petitioners as was done in the case of < org > rather nothing has been brought on record by < org > as to how this land rate land premium has been raised from to from rs how this revision of rales which adversely affected their rights could be notified at their back without petitioners having any say are courts so powerless under article of the constitution that when such a mischief so apparent is committed under the statutory powers that the citizen can be non suited on the pretext that it falls in the realm of contractual obligations and this < org > under article of
318	the constitution is a silent spectator there is no other authority whether
