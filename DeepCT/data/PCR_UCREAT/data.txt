after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of sec tion or that there has been a breach of a

injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in clause of sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section be of no effect provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability or any person which

insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person no insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub section", "has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in subsection otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section it will have been noticed that sub of makes an insurer liable on the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured sub section provides that no sum shall be payable by the insurer under sub unless he has been given notice of the proceedings resulting in that judgment and that an insurer who has been given such a notice shall be entitled to be made a party to the action and to defend it on the grounds enumerated the contention of the appellants is that when an insurer becomes a party to an action under sub he is entitled to defend it on all grounds available at law including the grounds on which the assured himself could have relied for his defence and that the only restriction on the insurer right of defence is that he cannot rely on the conditions of the policy which sub makes as of no effect this is the contention which we have to examine in these appeals to start with it is necessary to remember that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury sub section of however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it the right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute it would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others to do that would be adding words to the statute it says that no insurer to whom the notice of the action has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability under sub otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section now the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in subs is by successfully raising any of the defences therein mentioned if he could then he would have been in a position to avoid his liability in a manner other than that provided for in sub we therefore think that sub clearly provides that an insurer made a defendant to the action is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified in it three reported decisions were cited at the bar and all of them proceeded on the basis that an insurer had no right to defend the action except on the grounds mentioned in sub it does not appear however to have been seriously contended in any of these cases that the insurer could defend the action on a ground other than one of those mentioned in sub the learned counsel for the respondents the plaintiffs in the action referred us to the analogous english statute the road traffic act in support of", "the view that the insurer is restricted in his defence to the grounds set out in sub we proceed now to consider the arguments advanced by the learned solicitor general who appeared for the appellants he contended that there was nothing in sub to restrict the defence of an insurer to the grounds therein enumerated said that as under sub an insurer was entitled to be made a defendant to the action it followed that he had the right to take all legal defences excepting those expressly prohibited sub section in fact deals with defences other than those based on the conditions of a policy thus cl a of that sub section permits an insurer to defend an action on the ground that the policy has been duly cancelled provided the conditions set out in that clause have been satisfied clause gives him the right to defend the action on the ground that the policy is void as having been obtained by non disclosure of a material fact or a material false representation of fact therefore it cannot be said that in enacting sub the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy it also seems to us that even if sub and sub were confined only to defences based on the conditions of the policy that would not have led to the conclusion that the legislature thought that other defences not based on such conditions would be open to an insurer if that was what the legislature intended then there was nothing to prevent it from expressing its intention what the legislature has done is to enumerate in sub the defences available to an insurer and to provide by sub that he cannot avoid his liability excepting by means of such defences in order that sub may be interpreted in the way the learned solicitor general suggests we have to add words to it the learned solicitor general concedes this and says that the only word that has to be added is the word also after the word grounds but even this the rules of interpretation do not permit us to do unless the section as it stands is meaningless or of doubtful meaning neither of which we think it is the addition suggested will in our view make the language used unhappy and further effect a complete change in the meaning of the words used in the sub section we think that this is a very forced construction of sub and we are unable to adopt it the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in sub is through the defences therein mentioned therefore when sub talks of avoiding liability in the manner provided in sub it necessarily refers to these defences there is another ground on which the learned solicitor general supported the contention that all defences are open to an insurer excepting those taken away by sub", "he said that before the act came into force an injured person had no right of recourse to the insurer and that it was that made the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured binding on the insurer and gave him a right against the insurer he then said that being so it is only fair that a person sought to be made bound by a judgment should be entitled to resist his liability under it by all defences which he can in law advance against the passing of it the statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it it is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship we are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship first the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge he can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do secondly if he has been made to pay something which on the contract of the policy he was not bound to pay he can under the proviso to sub and under sub recover it from the assured it was said that the assured might be a man of straw and the insurer might not be able to recover anything from him in such circumstances the injured person also would not have been able to recover the damages suffered by him from the assured the person causing the injuries that also seems to us to be equitable for the loss falls on the insurer in the course of his carrying on his business a business out of which he makes profit and he could so arrange his business that in the net result he would never suffer a loss on the other hand if the loss fell on the injured person it would be due to no fault of his it would have been a loss suffered by him arising out of an incident in the happening of which he had no hand at all we think that < org > was right in the view that it took in the result these appeals are dismissed with costs [SEP]"]}

representation of fact which was false in some material particular where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in clause of sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section be of no effect provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability or any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person if the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person no insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub section", "has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in subsection otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section it will have been noticed that sub of makes an insurer liable on the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured sub section provides that no sum shall be payable by the insurer under sub unless he has been given notice of the proceedings resulting in that judgment and that an insurer who has been given such a notice shall be entitled to be made a party to the action and to defend it on the grounds enumerated the contention of the appellants is that when an insurer becomes a party to an action under sub he is entitled to defend it on all grounds available at law including the grounds on which the assured himself could have relied for his defence and that the only restriction on the insurer right of defence is that he cannot rely on the conditions of the policy which sub makes as of no effect this is the contention which we have to examine in these appeals to start with it is necessary to remember that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury sub section of however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it the right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute it would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others to do that would be adding words to the statute it says that no insurer to whom the notice of the action has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability under sub otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section now the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in subs is by successfully raising any of the defences therein mentioned if he could then he would have been in a position to avoid his liability in a manner other than that provided for in sub we therefore think that sub clearly provides that an insurer made a defendant to the action is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified in it three reported decisions were cited at the bar and all of them proceeded on the basis that an insurer had no right to defend the action except on the grounds mentioned in sub it does not appear however to have been seriously contended in any of these cases that the insurer could defend the action on a ground other than one of those mentioned in sub the learned counsel for the respondents the plaintiffs in the action referred us to the analogous english statute the road traffic act in support of", "the view that the insurer is restricted in his defence to the grounds set out in sub we proceed now to consider the arguments advanced by the learned solicitor general who appeared for the appellants he contended that there was nothing in sub to restrict the defence of an insurer to the grounds therein enumerated said that as under sub an insurer was entitled to be made a defendant to the action it followed that he had the right to take all legal defences excepting those expressly prohibited sub section in fact deals with defences other than those based on the conditions of a policy thus cl a of that sub section permits an insurer to defend an action on the ground that the policy has been duly cancelled provided the conditions set out in that clause have been satisfied clause gives him the right to defend the action on the ground that the policy is void as having been obtained by non disclosure of a material fact or a material false representation of fact therefore it cannot be said that in enacting sub the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy it also seems to us that even if sub and sub were confined only to defences based on the conditions of the policy that would not have led to the conclusion that the legislature thought that other defences not based on such conditions would be open to an insurer if that was what the legislature intended then there was nothing to prevent it from expressing its intention what the legislature has done is to enumerate in sub the defences available to an insurer and to provide by sub that he cannot avoid his liability excepting by means of such defences in order that sub may be interpreted in the way the learned solicitor general suggests we have to add words to it the learned solicitor general concedes this and says that the only word that has to be added is the word also after the word grounds but even this the rules of interpretation do not permit us to do unless the section as it stands is meaningless or of doubtful meaning neither of which we think it is the addition suggested will in our view make the language used unhappy and further effect a complete change in the meaning of the words used in the sub section we think that this is a very forced construction of sub and we are unable to adopt it the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in sub is through the defences therein mentioned therefore when sub talks of avoiding liability in the manner provided in sub it necessarily refers to these defences there is another ground on which the learned solicitor general supported the contention that all defences are open to an insurer excepting those taken away by sub", "he said that before the act came into force an injured person had no right of recourse to the insurer and that it was that made the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured binding on the insurer and gave him a right against the insurer he then said that being so it is only fair that a person sought to be made bound by a judgment should be entitled to resist his liability under it by all defences which he can in law advance against the passing of it the statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it it is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship we are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship first the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge he can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do secondly if he has been made to pay something which on the contract of the policy he was not bound to pay he can under the proviso to sub and under sub recover it from the assured it was said that the assured might be a man of straw and the insurer might not be able to recover anything from him in such circumstances the injured person also would not have been able to recover the damages suffered by him from the assured the person causing the injuries that also seems to us to be equitable for the loss falls on the insurer in the course of his carrying on his business a business out of which he makes profit and he could so arrange his business that in the net result he would never suffer a loss on the other hand if the loss fell on the injured person it would be due to no fault of his it would have been a loss suffered by him arising out of an incident in the happening of which he had no hand at all we think that < org > was right in the view that it took in the result these appeals are dismissed with costs [SEP]"]}

previously if so the right cannot be extended beyond what the statute gives it is true that the statute gives a right to the insurer to become a party to the action by the injured person which he did not have previously but the real question before the court is whether sub limits the right to defend on the grounds stated in that sub section in my submission subs exhausts only the defences based on the conditions of the policy which the insurer may wish to take if it was intended that these were to be the only defences open to the insurer the word only should have been used instead of the words any of before the words the following grounds what the legislature meant was that the insurer could defend the action also on the grounds stated in sub in addition to other grounds it can mean either that the insurer can take other defences or that he is limited to the matters stated in sub in those cases the hardship was sought to be overcome by allowing the insurer to defending the name of the insured i do not say that this latter procedure is correct but it shows that there is hardship < name > how can that be done how can the insurer be allowed to defend in the name of the insured how is the record to be", "kept there is no provision under which it can be done not even under of the code of civil procedure but that question does not arise for deter mination in this appeal the manner of avoiding liability stated in sub is that the insurer should apply to be made a party consequently the insurer can avoid liability only by being joined as a party hence the insurer can avoid liability only by being joined as a party but can take any defences he chooses including those stated in sub otherwise the third party and the assured may collude and a judgment may be passed which the insurer would be bound to satisfy without having had an opportunity of defending himself the real party affected is the insurer and yet he is given no right to be heard except on the limited grounds stated in sub before there was no system of compulsory insurance in respect of third party risks in england in the event of an accident the injured third party had a right to sue the motorist and recover damages even in those cases in which the motorist had taken out an insurance policy difficulties arose in the way of the injured third party recovering compensation the injured third party had no direct right of action against the insurer if the insurer failed to do so the third party had a right of action against the insurer based on the judgment obtained against the assured in this action a notice had to be sent to the third party injured who was given a right to join as a party and oppose the action at common law the insurer had no right to intervene in the action by the injured party against the insured and oppose the claim on merits that there was no accident or negligence or that there was contributory negligence etc the insurer could avoid liability only by showing that he was not liable for some reason connected with the policy it does not give additional rights to the insurer over what he would have had at common law or in accordance with the english statutes on the interpretation suggested by the solicitor general the insurer would get a right he never had before there is no ambiguity in it prevents the insurer from avoiding liability in a manner other than that stated in sub there is no hardship caused by giving full effect to the section as it stands by the insurer is given a right to recover from the insured any sums paid by him which he was not bound to pay due to breaches of conditions in the policy but which conditions have been made ineffective as against the third party sub section of the same section gives the insurer the right to recover from the < org > the excess which he is made to pay by virtue of over his obligations in the policy someone had to bear the loss ultimately and the legislature", "has tried so far as possible to ensure that the loss falls on the person causing the accident now the bombay cases referred to by the solicitor general are right in so far as they hold that the insurer can defend only on the grounds stated in sub those cases are wrong in proceeding on the assumption that there is hardship caused to the insurer by this view order rule code of civil procedure allows an ex parte decree to be set aside only at the instance of the defendant whilst there is no such limitation in there is no procedure known to law by which the insurer can be allowed to defend in the name of the insured this cannot be done

the insurer see < name > < name > all it was not necessary to expressly over rule the case of windsor < name > as in < org > was set tip in england as a result of which an insurer is bound to satisfy

person should be joined as a party if his presence is necessary for an effectual and complete adjudication the suits had been filed against owners of motor cars for recovery of damages suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the negligent driving of the cars the owners of the cars were insured against third party risks and the insurers were subsequently added as defendants to the suits under the provisions of sub of of the motor vehicles act the terms of that subsection will have to be set out later but it may now be stated that it provided that an insurer added as a party to an action under it was entitled to defend on the grounds enumerated in it on being added as defendants the insurers filed written statements taking defences other than those mentioned in", "that sub section the plaintiffs contended that the written statements should be taken off the records as the insurers could defend the action only on the grounds mentioned in the sub section and on no others a question thereupon arose in the suits as to what defences were available to the insurers in one of the suits it was held that the insurer could take only the defences specified in that sub section and in the other suit the view taken was that the insurers were not confined to those defences < org > held that the insurers could defend the actions only on the grounds mentioned in the subsection and on no others the question is whether the defences available to an insurer added as a party under are only those mentioned there section deals with the requirements of the policies of such insurance and the limits of the liability to be covered thereby sub section of this section provides a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of person specified in the policy to the extent specified in subsection against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place then comes round which the arguments advanced in this case have turned and some of its provisions have to be set out if after a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments no sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action", "on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of sec tion or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire on reward or for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle in a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in clause of sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section be of no effect provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability or any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person if the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person no insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub section", "has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in subsection otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section it will have been noticed that sub of makes an insurer liable on the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured sub section provides that no sum shall be payable by the insurer under sub unless he has been given notice of the proceedings resulting in that judgment and that an insurer who has been given such a notice shall be entitled to be made a party to the action and to defend it on the grounds enumerated the contention of the appellants is that when an insurer becomes a party to an action under sub he is entitled to defend it on all grounds available at law including the grounds on which the assured himself could have relied for his defence and that the only restriction on the insurer right of defence is that he cannot rely on the conditions of the policy which sub makes as of no effect this is the contention which we have to examine in these appeals to start with it is necessary to remember that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury sub section of however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it the right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute it would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others to do that would be adding words to the statute it says that no insurer to whom the notice of the action has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability under sub otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section now the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in subs is by successfully raising any of the defences therein mentioned if he could then he would have been in a position to avoid his liability in a manner other than that provided for in sub we therefore think that sub clearly provides that an insurer made a defendant to the action is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified in it three reported decisions were cited at the bar and all of them proceeded on the basis that an insurer had no right to defend the action except on the grounds mentioned in sub it does not appear however to have been seriously contended in any of these cases that the insurer could defend the action on a ground other than one of those mentioned in sub the learned counsel for the respondents the plaintiffs in the action referred us to the analogous english statute the road traffic act in support of", "the view that the insurer is restricted in his defence to the grounds set out in sub we proceed now to consider the arguments advanced by the learned solicitor general who appeared for the appellants he contended that there was nothing in sub to restrict the defence of an insurer to the grounds therein enumerated said that as under sub an insurer was entitled to be made a defendant to the action it followed that he had the right to take all legal defences excepting those expressly prohibited sub section in fact deals with defences other than those based on the conditions of a policy thus cl a of that sub section permits an insurer to defend an action on the ground that the policy has been duly cancelled provided the conditions set out in that clause have been satisfied clause gives him the right to defend the action on the ground that the policy is void as having been obtained by non disclosure of a material fact or a material false representation of fact therefore it cannot be said that in enacting sub the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy it also seems to us that even if sub and sub were confined only to defences based on the conditions of the policy that would not have led to the conclusion that the legislature thought that other defences not based on such conditions would be open to an insurer if that was what the legislature intended then there was nothing to prevent it from expressing its intention what the legislature has done is to enumerate in sub the defences available to an insurer and to provide by sub that he cannot avoid his liability excepting by means of such defences in order that sub may be interpreted in the way the learned solicitor general suggests we have to add words to it the learned solicitor general concedes this and says that the only word that has to be added is the word also after the word grounds but even this the rules of interpretation do not permit us to do unless the section as it stands is meaningless or of doubtful meaning neither of which we think it is the addition suggested will in our view make the language used unhappy and further effect a complete change in the meaning of the words used in the sub section we think that this is a very forced construction of sub and we are unable to adopt it the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in sub is through the defences therein mentioned therefore when sub talks of avoiding liability in the manner provided in sub it necessarily refers to these defences there is another ground on which the learned solicitor general supported the contention that all defences are open to an insurer excepting those taken away by sub", "he said that before the act came into force an injured person had no right of recourse to the insurer and that it was that made the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured

not convinced that the statute causes any hardship first the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge he can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do secondly if he has been made to pay something which on the contract of the policy he was not bound to pay he can under the proviso to sub and under sub recover it from the assured it was said that the assured might be a man of straw and the insurer might not be able to recover anything from him in such circumstances the injured person also would not have been able to recover the damages suffered by him from the assured the person causing the injuries that also seems to us to be equitable for the loss falls on the insurer in the course of his carrying on his business a business out of which he makes profit and he could so arrange his business that in the net result he would never suffer a loss on the other hand if the loss fell on the injured person it would be due to no fault of his it would have been a loss suffered by him arising out of an incident in the happening of which he had no hand at all we think that <

insurer the word only should have been used instead of the words any of before the words the following grounds what the legislature meant was that the insurer could defend the action also on the grounds stated in sub in addition to other grounds it can mean either that the insurer can take other defences or that he is limited to the matters stated in sub in those cases the hardship was sought to be overcome by allowing the insurer to defending the name of the insured i do not say that this latter procedure is correct but it shows that there is hardship < name > how can that be done how can the insurer be allowed to defend in the name of the insured how is the record to be", "kept there is no provision under which it can be done not even under of the code of civil procedure but that question does not arise for deter mination in this appeal the manner of avoiding liability stated in sub is that the insurer should apply to be made a party consequently the insurer can avoid liability only by being joined as a party hence the insurer can avoid liability only by being joined as a party but can take any defences he chooses including those stated in sub otherwise the third party and the assured may collude and a judgment may be passed which the insurer would be bound to satisfy without having had an opportunity of defending himself the real party affected is the insurer and yet he is given no right to be heard except on the limited grounds stated in sub before there was no system of compulsory insurance in respect of third party risks in england in the event of an accident the injured third party had a right to sue the motorist and recover damages even in those cases in which the motorist had taken out an insurance policy difficulties arose in the way of the injured third party recovering compensation the injured third party had no direct right of action against the insurer if the insurer failed to do so the third party had a right of action against the insurer based on the judgment obtained against the assured in this action a notice had to be sent to the third party injured who was given a right to join as a party and oppose the action at common law the insurer had no right to intervene in the action by the injured party against the insured and oppose the claim on merits that there was no accident or negligence or that there was contributory negligence etc the insurer could avoid liability only by showing that he was not liable for some reason connected with the policy it does not give additional rights to the insurer over what he would have had at common law or in accordance with the english statutes on the interpretation suggested by the solicitor general the insurer would get a right he never had before there is no ambiguity in it prevents the insurer from avoiding liability in a manner other than that stated in sub there is no hardship caused by giving full effect to the section as it stands by the insurer is given a right to recover from the insured any sums paid by him which he was not bound to pay due to breaches of conditions in the policy but which conditions have been made ineffective as against the third party sub

ultimately and the legislature", "has tried so far as possible to ensure that the loss falls on the person causing the accident now the bombay cases referred to by the solicitor general are right in so far as they hold that the insurer can defend only on the grounds stated in sub those cases are wrong in proceeding on the assumption that there is hardship caused to the insurer by this view order rule code of civil procedure allows an ex parte decree to be set aside only at the instance of the defendant whilst there is no such limitation in there is no procedure known to law by which the

filed against owners of motor cars for recovery of damages suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the negligent driving of the cars the owners of the cars were insured against third party risks and the insurers were subsequently added as defendants to the suits under the provisions of sub of of the motor vehicles act the terms of that subsection will have to be set out later but it may now be stated that it provided that an insurer added as a party to an action under it was entitled to defend on the grounds enumerated in it on being added as defendants the insurers filed written statements taking defences other than those mentioned in", "that sub section the plaintiffs contended that the written statements should be taken off the records as the insurers could defend the action only on the grounds mentioned in the sub section and on no others a question thereupon arose in the suits as to what defences were available to the insurers in one of the suits it was held that the insurer could take only the defences specified in that sub section and in the other suit the view taken was that the insurers were not confined to those defences < org > held that the insurers could defend the actions only on the grounds mentioned in the subsection and on no others the question is whether the defences available to an insurer added as a party under are only those mentioned there section deals with the requirements of the policies of such insurance and the limits of the liability to be covered thereby sub section of this section provides a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of person specified in the policy to the extent specified in subsection against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place then comes round which the arguments advanced in this case have turned and some of its provisions have to be set out if after a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments no sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action", "on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of sec tion or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire on reward or for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle in a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub section of section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in clause of sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause of sub section of section be of no effect provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability or any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person if the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person no insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub section", "has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in subsection otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section it will have been noticed that sub of makes an insurer liable on the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured sub section provides that no sum shall be payable by the insurer under sub unless he has been given notice of the proceedings resulting in that judgment and that an insurer who has been given such a notice shall be entitled to be made a party to the action and to defend it on the grounds enumerated the contention of the appellants is that when an insurer becomes a party to an action under sub he is entitled to defend it on all grounds available at law including the grounds on which the assured himself could have relied for his defence and that the only restriction on the insurer right of defence is that he cannot rely on the conditions of the policy which sub makes as of no effect this is the contention which we have to examine in these appeals to start with it is necessary to remember that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury sub section of however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it the right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute it would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others to do that would be adding words to the statute it says that no insurer to whom the notice of the action has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability under sub otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section now the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in subs is by successfully raising any of the defences therein mentioned if he could then he would have been in a position to avoid his liability in a manner other than that provided for in sub we therefore think that sub clearly provides that an insurer made a defendant to the action is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified in it three reported decisions were cited at the bar and all of them proceeded on the basis that an insurer had no right to defend the action except on the grounds mentioned in sub it does not appear however to have been seriously contended in any of these cases that the insurer could defend the action on a ground other than one of those mentioned in sub the learned counsel for the respondents the plaintiffs in the action referred us to the analogous english statute the road traffic act in support of", "the view that the insurer is restricted in his defence to the grounds set out in sub we proceed now to consider the arguments advanced by the learned solicitor general who appeared for the appellants he contended that there was nothing in sub to restrict the defence of an insurer to the grounds therein enumerated said that as under sub an insurer was entitled to be made a defendant to the action it followed that he had the right to take all legal defences excepting those expressly prohibited sub section in fact deals with defences other than those based on the conditions of a policy thus cl a of that sub section permits an insurer to defend an action on the ground that the policy has been duly cancelled provided the conditions set out in that clause have been satisfied clause gives him the right to defend the action on the ground that the policy is void as having been obtained by non disclosure of a material fact or a material false representation of fact therefore it cannot be said that in enacting sub the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy it also seems to us that even if sub and sub were confined only to defences based on the conditions of the policy that would not have led to the conclusion that the legislature thought that other defences not based on such conditions would be open to an insurer if that was what the legislature intended then there was nothing to prevent it from expressing its intention what the legislature has done is to enumerate in sub the defences available to an insurer and to provide by sub that he cannot avoid his liability excepting by means of such defences in order that sub may be interpreted in the way the learned solicitor general suggests we have to add words to it the learned solicitor general concedes this and says that the only word that has to be added is the word also after the word grounds but even this the rules of interpretation do not permit us to do unless the section as it stands is meaningless or of doubtful meaning neither of which we think it is the addition suggested will in our view make the language used unhappy and further effect a complete change in the meaning of the words used in the sub section we think that this is a very forced construction of sub and we are unable to adopt it the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in sub is through the defences therein mentioned therefore when sub talks of avoiding liability in the manner provided in sub it necessarily refers to these defences there is another ground on which the learned solicitor general supported the contention that all defences are open to an insurer excepting those taken away by sub", "he said that before the act came into force an injured person had no right of recourse to the insurer and that it was that made the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured binding on the insurer and gave him a right against the insurer he then said that being so it is only fair that a person sought to be made bound by a judgment should be entitled to resist his liability under it by all defences which he can in law advance against the passing of it the statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it it is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship we are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship first the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge he can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do secondly if he has been made to pay something which on the contract of the policy he was not bound to pay he can under the proviso to sub and under sub recover it from the assured it was said that the assured might be a man of straw and the insurer might not be able to recover anything from him in such circumstances the injured person also would not have been able to recover the damages suffered by him from the assured the person causing the injuries that also seems to us to be equitable for the loss falls on the insurer in the course of his carrying on his business a business out of which he makes profit and he could so arrange his business that in the net result he would never suffer a loss on the other hand if the loss fell on the injured person it would be due to no fault of his it would have been a loss suffered by him arising out of an incident in the happening of which he had no hand at all we think that < org > was right in the view that it took in the result these appeals are dismissed with costs [SEP]"]}

from the names entered in that register also strictly in the same order the selection cannot arbitrarily be restricted to a few candidates notwithstanding the number of vacancies and the availability of qualified candidates there must be a conscious application of the mind of the < org > and < org > before the number of persons selected for appointment is restricted in the instant case the reason given by < org > for not communicating the entire list of qualified candidates to the < org > is that they were originally informed that there were only vacancies out of the candidates who appeared at

and they included from the general category the petitioner claims that candidates in order of merit from the general category should have been selected for appointment and that the < org > the rules relating to the appointment of subordinate judges in haryana are in six parts a part a deals with qualifications part deals with submission of rolls rule prescribes that no candidate shall be called for the viva voce test unless he obtains at least per cent marks in the aggregate in all", "the written papers and per cent marks in the language paper hindi in devanagri script no candidate shall be considered to have qualified in the examination unless he obtains at least per cent in the aggregate of all papers including viva voce test provided that in case two or more candidates obtain equal marks their merit shall be determined according to the marks secured by them in the viva voce and if the marks in the viva voce of the candidates are also equal the older in age shall be placed higher in order of merit rule is also important and it is as follows i the result of the examination will < org > ii candidates will be selected for appointment strictly in the order in which they have been placed by < org > in the list of those who have qualified under rule provided that in the case of candidates belonging to the scheduled castes tribes and other backward classes government will have a right to select in order of merit a candidate who has merely qualified under rule irrespective of the position obtained by him in the examination provided further that the selection of candidates belonging to the scheduled castes tribes and other backward classes in the order of merit inter se shall be made against the vacancies reserved for them and in the manner prescribed by < org > from time to time rule of part is as follows the names of candidates selected by < org > for appointment as subordinate judges under rules and of part shall be entered on the < org > in the order of their selection rule may also be extracted and it is as follows whenever it shall appear to the judges that a vacancy or vacancies in the cadre of the judicial branch of < org > whether permanent temporary or officiating should be filled they will make a selection from the < org > in the order in which the names have been entered in the register under rule of this part every subordinate judge shall in the first instance be appointed on probation for two years but this period may be extended from time to time expressly or impliedly so that the total period of probation including extension if any does not exceed three years rule is again important and it is as follows there is no limit to the number of names borne on the < org > but ordinarily no more names will be included than are estimated to be sufficient for the filling of vacancies which are anticipated to be likely to occur within two years from the date of selection of candidates as a result of an examination unless a candidate secures per cent of the marks in the written papers and per cent in the language", "paper he will not be called for the viva voce test all candidates securing per cent of the marks in the aggregate in the written and viva voce tests are considered as qualified for appointment their merit being determined strictly in accordance with the marks obtained by them the result of the examination is required to be published in < org > and the selection for appointment is to be made strictly in the order in which they have been placed by < org > in the list of candidates qualified under rule of part the number of names to be entered in the register maintained by < org > may be sufficient to fill vacancies anticipated to occur within two years from the date of selection of candidates as a result of the examination the names of the selected candidates are then to be entered in the register maintained by < org > strictly in that order and appointments made from the names entered in that register also strictly in the same order the result was that although there were a large number of vacancies only a few candidates were selected for appointment however as we said the selection cannot arbitrarily be restricted to a few candidates notwithstanding the number of vacancies and the availability of qualified candidates there must be a conscious application of the mind of the < org > and < org > before the number of persons selected for appointment is restricted in the present case though the rules required < org > to publish the result of the examination and apparently also to communicate the result to the < org > < org > did not publish the result in the first instance and sent only the names of candidates belonging to general category to the < org > though many more had qualified the reason given by < org > for not communicating the entire list of qualified candidates to < org > is that they were originally informed that there were only vacancies the < org > of haryana has taken the stand that they were unable to select and appoint more candidates as the names of only a few candidates were sent to them by < org > it now transpires that even before < org > sent its truncated list to the < org > < org > had already informed the < org > that there were more vacancies which required to be filled if the < org > had been aware that there were qualified

receivable in the context in which it occurred in section indicated that it was the trust deed that one had to look at and not the actual exercise of discretion by the trustees in the course of the year section permitted the direct assessment of the beneficiary when it could possibly be done under the provisions of sections to in chapter xv because of the impossibility to deal with income in such cases the legislature had made the special provision of section the money in question so soon as the discretion was exercised in favour of one or more beneficiaries was receivable by them in fulfilment of the disposition made by the trust deed and what was merely a right to be considered as a potential recipient of a benefit became a vested right to receive the income or part of it according to the exercise of the discretion by the trustees the money in question as soon as the discretion was exercised was held in trust for the respective beneficiaries and they became entitled to receive the same in cases covered by section the option could be exercised on the strength of the trust deed itself since the income in such cases was specifically receivable by the trustees on behalf of or for the benefit of a single beneficiary or where there were more beneficiaries than one the individual shares of the beneficiaries were determinate and known so far as cases covered by section were concerned the exercise of the option became possible only upon the discretionary trustees allocating amongst the beneficiaries the whole or part of the income in the exercise of their discretion during the accounting year for upon the happening of such event the income was received by the beneficiaries in fulfilment of the disposition made by the trust deed and such income became chargeable to tax in the hands of the beneficiaries in view of the provisions of sections and of the act as regards the use", "of the word charge in the marginal note and the body of section in contradistinction to the use of the expression levied upon and recovered from in section the difference in the choice of language was of no significance the word charged in section could only be construed as conveying the meaning levied and recovered section was attracted in cases covered by section where the beneficiaries had received the income or part thereof pursuant to the exercise of discretion by the trustees of a discretionary trust in the course of the same accounting year even assuming that the word receivable in section had to be interpreted to mean receivable under the trust deed and that it was the trust deed that one had to look at this interpretation did not come in the way of holding that even a discretionary beneficiary pursuant to the exercise of discretion in his favour and upon his receiving his share of the income in the course of the accounting year in which it was received by the trustees was liable to be assessed and taxed in respect thereof the dissenting judgment therefore answered the question that was posed in the affirmative that is to say in favour of the < org > and against the assessee the learned solicitor general appearing for the < org > submitted that when income was received on behalf of a beneficiary of a trust the beneficiary could be directly assessed under section the act did not intend to levy tax except in relation to the person who received income beneficially at the same time it was made clear that the representative assessee liability did not extend beyond the limit of the direct assessee implicitly recognising the liability of the direct assessee to be assessed the second part of section namely levy and recovery in like manner and to the same extent was inherently inapplicable to the situation and it was here that section made special provision as to the status in which and the rate at which the tax was to be levied and recovered from the trustee no judgment stated that the income of a trust must only be assessed in the hands of the trustee what was stated was that where the assessment was made in the hands of the trustee it could only be made in terms of the provisions of sections to or the equivalent provisions of sections and of the act on a parity of reasoning there was no impediment to taxing the beneficiary of a discretionary trust when he had received the income in the accounting year section therefore excluded the application of section wherever it became applicable on account of the existence of the circumstances therein mentioned the argument that there were two limbs to section was misconceived because the trustees were liable to tax as owners and a beneficial interest in the income was not a condition essential to", "make the income taxable there are three judgments of this court which have a bearing on these appeals it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the income tax officer was bound to assess the income under each trust deed separately in the hands of the trustees as representative assessees and by reason of section was incompetent to assess the income in the hands of either the appellant or the beneficiaries this court held that it was implicit in the terms of section that the income tax officer could assess a representative assessee as regards the income in respect of which he was a representative assessee but he was not bound to do so the income tax officer could assess the person represented in respect of the income of the trust property and the appropriate provisions of the act relating to the computation of his total income and the manner in which the income was to be computed would apply to such assessment the contention raised by the appellant counsel that since the trustees were assessable in respect of the income of the beneficiaries under section that income could not by virtue of section be assessed in the hands of the beneficiaries was contrary to the plain terms of section it merely enacted that when a representative assessee was assessed to tax in the exercise of the option of the < org > he could be assessed only under the provisions of chapter xv and under no other provisions of the act it was pointed out that section had been enacted to remove the conflict of judicial opinion which had arisen in regard to the interpretation of the analogous provisions of sections and of the act they read it is clear that every case of an assessment against a trustee must fall under section and it is equally clear that even though a trustee is being assessed the assessment must proceed in the manner laid down in chapter iii section only comes into play after the income has been computed in accordance with chapter then the question of payment of tax arises and it is at that stage that section issues a mandate to < org > that when they are dealing with the income of a trustee they must levy the tax and recover it in the manner laid down in section it merely enacted that when income was assessed in the hands of a representative assessee in his own name the assessment would be deemed to be made upon him in the representative capacity only and tax could be levied and recovered in the manner provided in section the question that was considered was whether assessment could be made on the trustees under section apart from and without reference to section net wealth was defined in section to mean the amount by which the aggregate value computed in accordance with the provisions of this act of all the assets where", "##ver located belonging to the assessee on the valuation date including assets required to be included in his net wealth as on date under this act is in excess of the aggregate value of all the debts owed by the assessee on the valuation date an argument was advanced on behalf of the trustees that assets held by a trustee in the trust for others could not be said to be assets belonging to the trustee so as to be included in his net wealth prima facie this court observed there seemed to be force in the argument but it was not thought necessary to express any final opinion since there was an alternative argument advanced on behalf of the assessee which left no room for doubt but section imposed the charge of wealth tax subject to the other provisions of the act and these other provisions included section section was therefore made expressly subject to section and had to yield to that section insofar as the latter made special provision for the assessment of a trustee of a trust it was clear on a combined reading of sections and that whenever assessment was made on a trustee it had to be made in accordance with the provisions of section every case of assessment on a trustee would necessarily fall under section and he could not be assessed apart from and without reference to that section to take a contrary view giving option to the < org > to assess the trustee under section without following the provisions of section would be to refuse to give effect to the words subject to the other provisions of this act in section to ignore the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant and to deny mandatory force and effect to the provisions of section it had also to be noted that the assessment which was to be made on a trustee under section was an assessment in a representative capacity it was really the beneficiaries who were sought to be assessed in respect of their interest in the trust properties through the trustees this provision could apply only where the trust properties were field by the trustee for the benefit of a single beneficiary or where there were more beneficiaries than one the individual shares of the beneficiaries in the trust properties were determinate and known the beneficial interest was treated as if it belonged to one individual beneficiary and assessment was made on the trustee in the same manner and to the same extent as it would be made on such fictional beneficiary mr < name > drew our attention to the judgment of this court in < org > < name > where the trust deed provided for payment to the beneficiary of a minimum sum and left it to the discretion of the trustees whether or not any further distribution of income should be made there were similar provisions in", "relation to the corpus of the trust on the distribution of the accumulated balance at the end of the stipulated period there was no right in the beneficiary to receive any part thereof it was open to the trustees to ignore him altogether and they could pay it to such other members of the family as they chose as the judgments of this court referred to above lay down a representative assessee may be assessed in respect of income received by him as such and tax recovered from him thereon only under and in the scc itr scc scc tax manner provided by the provisions in the statute dealing with representative assessees a trustee may therefore be assessed in respect of the income of the trust and tax recovered from him thereon only under and in the manner provided by sections to of the act its first part makes him subject as regards the income in respect of which he is a representative assessee to the same duties responsibilities and liabilities as if the income were income received by or accruing to or in favour of him beneficially and he is made liable to assessment in his own name in respect thereof section states that where any income in respect of which a trustee is liable as representative assessee is not specifically receivable on behalf or for the benefit of any one person or where the individual shares of the persons on whose behalf or for whose benefit such income or part thereof is receivable are indeterminate or unknown tax shall be charged as if such income were the total income of an association of persons or where such income or part thereof is actually received by a beneficiary then at the rate applicable to the total income of the beneficiary if such course benefits the < org > put differently section states that tax shall be levied upon the income of a discretionary trust as if it were the total income of an association of persons except that if it or part of it is actually received by a beneficiary it or that part of it becomes chargeable to tax at the rate applicable to the total income of the beneficiary if that course is beneficial to the < org > the word charged in the context in which it is used in section means only levied section does not give any of these protections as clearly they must be given to all representative assessees the liability of a trustee of a discretionary trust to be assessed to tax in respect of its income and to recovery thereof is created by section and it also states that he is not liable to such assessment under any other provisions of the act section set out only how such tax shall be charged when the income is not distributed and when the income is distributed the principle contention raised by mr <", "name > on behalf of the assessee must accordingly be rejected why then should the beneficiary of a discretionary trust stand on a footing different from that of the beneficiary of a specific trust it is true that the language of section does not avail the < org > because it states that sections to do not prevent either the direct assessment of the person on whose behalf or for whose benefit income therein referred to is receivable or the recovery from such person of the tax payable in respect of such income even so since the word used in section is receivable it cannot apply to a discretionary trust for it cannot be said that the income thereon is receivable for one or more beneficiaries it being left to the discretion of the trustees whether or not the income should be distributed to one or more of the beneficiaries or not at all section of the act defines the total income of any person to include income received by him or received on his behalf or which accrues or arises to him it was said that it was implicit in the terms of section that the income tax officer could assess a representative assessee as regards the income in respect of which he was a representative assessee but he was not bound to do so it must also be remembered as was said in the case of < org > that when a trustee is assessed to tax upon the income of the trust it is really the beneficiaries who are

my learned brother for the reasons given by him which i need not repeat that we should exercise the power given to us by section itself to excuse delay in the circumstances of this case the second objection is based on the argument that an order like the one under appeal granting sanction to the official liquidator to sell by private sale is not one of the orders falling within section in this argument the respondent really lands himself in a dilemma for if the order granting sanction is not appealable it is not clear how the order revoking that sanction can be appealable and his appeals

creditors shall be made ex parte on the application of the official liquidator it is suggested that the rule does not apply to orders of sanction but only to orders which are ex facie to the prejudice of contributories such as orders to them to pay i do not see why the rule should be read in this restricted manner the words being wide enough to cover the present case an order for sale of a company property and an order for the adoption of a particular mode of conducting that sale are both to my mind orders which may work to the prejudice of the contributories and creditors as they may result in considerable loss to them it stands to reason that such orders should not be made without notice and there is thus no valid ground to read the rule as not referring to them no authority has been cited

this conclusion as regards hardship resort to the < org > inherent power is unnecessary when as it seems to me the wording of rules and is wide enough to cover all ordinary cases of default including those instanced by < name > in which the circumstances of a failure to appear are in question and it may be suggested that in them the matters referred to by him the merits of the defaulter case if indeed they can safely be assumed at that stage in the proceedings and the grave consequences of an ex parte disposal can in fact be considered in order to form an estimate of the honesty of the

following remedies are open he can bring a suit to set aside the decree if there has been any fraud in the obtaining of it see < name > < name > i cal he can prefer an appeal against the decree itself there can be no doubt that the powers of < org > are large enough to enable it to set aside the ex parte decree if there has been a miscarriage of justice < org > is not confined to the grounds

is comprehensive enough to cover most cases of default of appearance there is no reason for limiting the language of the clause in that way further there is the authority of < name > < name > against this suggestion i am therefore of opinion that there is no reason for invoking the inherent power of the < org > in respect of this matter on the question of a < org > possessing such a power i have great doubts because in either case the effect of entertaining the proceeding is to vacate a decree which has been obtained by one of the parties to the suit a right of remand is implied in the right to hear the appeal therefore the possession of an inherent power", "to remand does not argue that there is a power to set aside an ex parte decree on grounds other than those mentioned in order rule section has been introduced for the simple reason that no code can exhaustively deal with the procedure for exercising every power which a < org > of justice is competent to exercise and the language of the section shows that it should be availed of only where a power which has been exercised has not been provided for in the code as i pointed out already there is no necessity for invoking the principle of the remedy ex debito justitiae because in all conceivable cases excepting a case like the present in which the lower < org > has made no attempt to conform itself to any rule or precedent the party aggrieved can obtain justice by resorting to the proper procedure but none of them are cases in which the question of setting aside an ex parte decree directly arose the learned judges point out that there was by the practice of the < org > an inherent power which should not be regarded as having been taken away by the code of civil procedure but i am clear that where there is no proof that the power has been exercised by < org > s and where the < org > has given that power with limitations < org > s are not at liberty to disregard the limitations [SEP]"]}

the present suit they sold the right and interest of the two persons named in it still in the execution of the decree treating it as an instrument which had pledged the shares of those two in th at case therefore the plaintiff having obtained a decree by which the shares of the two persons who were the executants of the bond were rendered liable and having in execution of that decree sold these shares brought a second suit for the purpose of extending the operation of that decree on the ground that the original loan that was taken by < name > and < name > was taken not on behalf of themselves only but on behalf of themselves and the remaining members of the joint hindu family of which they are the members it was held that such a suit would not lie and that conclusion was arrived at upon the ground that either the original bond was executed by these two persons alone or that it was executed by these two persons as managers of the joint family if executed by these two alone no suit would lie against the others if executed by them as managers then all the other members were liable jointly but the creditors having elected to sue some of the joint debtors only were not entitled to bring another suit against those left out in the first suit so far as the plaint contains a prayer to that effect it is no doubt liable to objection but so far as it is a suit to have it declared that the mortgaged property is liable to be sold in execution of the plaintiff decree it comes under section here the decree holders have brought this suit to establish the right that they are entitled to sell the mortgaged property in execution of the decree they have already obtained upon the original cause of action it may be observed however that in this last case the learned judges make this observation we do not wish to be understood to hold that in a suit properly brought the mortgagee cannot obtain an order from the < org > declaring that as a son in a mitakshara family a person in the position of the defendant might not be liable for debts lawfully incurred by his father that is not as we understand it the present case and the nature of the claim now made therefore", "we need not discuss the questions that have been raised in this appeal viz that where there are adult sons the father even in case of necessity has no right without the concurrence of these sons to deal with the ancestral property so far as this proposition goes it has been well established by decided cases and we are bound to hold that the adult sons are not concluded by a transaction to which they are not parties unless their assent to it express or implied is proved < org > has found against the plaintiff upon this point and there is no appeal against that part of the judgment we must therefore take it that it was ancestral but having regard to the circumstances to which we shall presently refer it seems to us that although there was no express consent by the sons there was clear evidence of implied consent on their part to the transaction of his lordship then considered the evidence as to this point and continued we consequently come to the conclusion that the mortgage of the th april was a valid transaction binding upon the whole of the family therefore we need not take any notice of the widow so far as the question of consent is concerned the plaintiffs have established their right to sell the mortgaged property [SEP]"]}

quite at variance with the precept which seems to restrict the father right of disposition over his self acquired property in an unqualified manner and in the same way as ancestral lands there occur

ancestral property if and when the father inherits such property on the death of the grandfather or receives it by partition made by the grandfather himself during his lifetime on both these occasions the grand father property comes to the father by virtue of the latter legal right as a son or descendant of the former and consequently it becomes ancestral property in his hands but when the father obtains the grandfather property by way of gift he receives it not because he is a son or has any legal right to such property but because his father chose to bestow a favour on him which he could have bestowed on any other person as well the interest which he takes in such property must depend upon the will of the grantor in placitum of the section it is stated that though a son born after partition takes the whole of his father and mother property yet if the father and mother has affectionately bestowed some property upon a separated son that must remain with him a text of yagnavalkya is then quoted that the effects which have been given by the father and by the mother belong to him on whom they are bestowed he has got to make it in accordance with the directions laid down in the law when however he makes a gift which is only an act of bounty he is unfetterd in the exercise of his discretion by any rule or dictate of law we hold therefore that there is no warrant for saying that according to the mitakshara an vider placitum of mitakshara if this is the correct view to take as we think it is it would furnish a complete answer to the other contention indicated above that such gifted property must be held partible between the father and the sons as it does not come within the definition self acquisition as given by < name > shara what is argued is this that as the father gift cannot be said to have been acquired by the son without detriment to the father estate it cannot be regarded as selfacquisition of the son within the meaning of the definition given above

{"query": "itself an exception the provision in placitum cannot be read as requiring that the gift must also be without detriment to the father estate for it would be a palpable contradition to say that there could be any gift by a father out of the estate without any detriment to the estate mayane hindu law th edition paragraph page another argument is stressed in this connection which seems to have found favour with the learned judges of < org > who decided the < org > case referred to above it is said that the exception in regard to father gift as laid down in placitum has reference only to partition between the donee and his brothers but so far as the male issue of the donee is concerned it still remains partible if the provision relating to self acquisition is applicable to all partitions whether between collaterals or between the father and his sons there is no conceivable reason why placitum which occurs in the same chapter and deals with the identical topic should not be made applicable to all cases of partition and should be confined to collaterals alone the reason for making this distinction is undoubtedly the theory of equal ownership between the father and the son ancestral property which we have discussed already and which in our opinion is not applicable to the father gifts at all our conclusion therefore is that a property gifted by a father to his son could not become ancestral property in the hands of the donee simply by reason of the fact that the donee got it from his father or ancestor as the law is accepted and well settled that a mitak shara father has complete powers of disposition over his selfacquired property it must follow as a necessary consequence that the father is quite competent to provide expressly when he makes a gift either that the donee would take it exclusively for himself or that the gift would be for the benefit of his branch of the family if there are express provisions to that effect either in the deed of gift or a will no difficulty is likely to arise and the interest which the son would take in such property would depend upon the terms of the grant if however there are no clear words describing the kind of interest which the donee is to take the question would be one of construction and the court would have to collect the intention of the donor from the language of the document taken vide bhagwant mst < name > i

{"query": "to confer a bounty upon his son exclusively for his benefit and capable of being dealt with by him at his pleasure or that the apparent gift was an integral part of a scheme for partition and what was given to the son was really the share of the property which would normally be allotted to him and in his branch of the family on partition as it is open to the father to make a gift or partition of his properties as he himself chooses there is strictly speaking no presumption that he intended either the one or the other he had three sons the eldest of whom was defendant no the sons are to enjoy the properties allotted to them with absolute rights and with powers of alienation such as gift exchange sale etc the testator it seems had already given certain properties to the wives of his two brothers and to his own wife also they were to enjoy these properties during the terms of their natural lives and after their death they would vest in one or the other of his sons authority was given to his wife to sell this property to defray the marriage expenses with its sale proceeds it seems to us on reading the document in the light of the surrounding circumstances that the dominant intention of the testator was to make suitable provisions for those of his near relations whom he considered to have claims upon his affection and bounty he did not want simply to make a division of his property amongst his heirs in the same way as they themselves would have done after his death with a view to avoid disputes in the future had the testator contemplated a partition as is contemplated by hindu law he would certainly have given his wife a share equal to that of a son and a quarter share to his unmarried daughter his brothers wives would not then come into the picture and there could be no question of his wife being authorised to sell a property to defray the marriage expenses of his unmarried son and daughter the testator certainly wanted to make a distribution of his properties in it way different from what would take place in case of intestacy here the will is perfectly explicit and it expressly vests the sons with absolute rights with full powers of alienation by way of sale gift and exchange there is no indication in the will that the properties bequeathed were to be held by the sons for their families or mate issues and although the will

of special legislation providing for special measures and the central idea dominating it is public safety and maintenance of public order in a situation requiring special measures it was argued that public safety and maintenance of public order are used in the act disjunctively and they are separated by the word or and not and and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of the act providing

used in article and if it was to be used in what sense it was to be used on the one hand they must have had before their mind the very widely accepted view supported by numerous authorities that

{"query": "cause it this passage brings out two matters with remarkable clarity it shows firstly that sedition is essentially an offence against public tranquillity and secondly that broadly speaking there are two classes of offences against public tranquillity a those accompanied by violence including disorders which affect tranquillity of a considerable number of persons or an extensive local

the < org > or tend to overthrow it if left unchecked and as i have tried to point out there is a good deal of authorita tive opinion in favour of the view that the gravity ascribed to sedition is due to the fact that it tends to seriously affect the tranquillity and security of the < org > in principle then it would not have been logical to refer to sedition in clause of article and omit matters which are no less grave and which have equal potentiality for undermining the security of the < org > it appears that the framers of the constitution preferred to adopt the logical course and have used the more general and basic words which are apt to cover sedition as well as other matters which are as detrimental to the security of the < org > as sedition if the act is to be viewed as i have suggested it is difficult to hold that section falls outside the ambit of article that clause clearly states that nothing in clause a shall affect the operation of any existing law relating to any

order to determine whether a right is abridged or infringed it is first necessary to determine the extent of the right given by the articles and the limitations pre scribed in the articles themselves permitting its curtail ment even in their absence if any of the fundamental rights was infiringed by any legislative enactment the < org > has always the power to declare the enactment to the extent it transgresses the limits invalid the existence of article and in the constitution therefore is not material for the decision of the question what fundamental right is given and to what extent it is permitted to be abridged by the constitution itself as the preventive detention order results in the deten tion of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article a and have been infringed it was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses and although this argu ment is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention if correct it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the indian penal code unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided the article has to be read without any pre conceived notions", "if there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article will arise any other construction put on the article it seems to me it was next urged that while this interpretation may meet the contention in respect of rights under article a and the right given by article is left untouched that sub clause expressly gives the right to move freely throughout the territory of india it was argued that by the confinement of the peti tioner under the preventive detention order his right to move freely throughout the territory of india is directly abridged and therefore the < org > must show that the im pugned legislation imposes only reasonable restrictions on the exercise of that right in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of < org > under article article of the constitution gives the right to equality in these terms the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of india similarly it was urged that the words territory of india in article may be treated as superfluous and preventive detention would thus be an abridgement of the right to move freely mean ing the sub clause only means that if restrictions are sought to be put upon movement of a citizen from state to state or even within a state such restrictions will have to be tested by the permissive limits prescribed in clause of that article the constitution men tions a right to freedom of movement throughout the territo ry of india every word of that clause must be given its true and legitimate meaning and in the construction of a statute particularly a constitution it is improper to omit any word which has a reasonable and proper place in it or to refrain from giving effect to its meaning this position is made quite clear when clause is read along with this sub clause reading article as a whole therefore it seems to me that it has no application to a legislation dealing with preventive or punitive detention as its direct object article gave substantive rights to citizens while article prescribed that no person can be deprived of his life and personal liberty except by procedure established by law even so on a true construction of article it seems to me that both preventive and punitive detention are outside the scope of article in order to appreciate the true scope of article it is useful to read it by itself and then to consider how far the other articles in part hi affect or control its meaning it gives the rights mentioned in a to to all citizens of india these rights read by", "them selves and apart from the controls found in clauses to of the same article specify the different general rights which a free citizen in a democratic country ordi narily has but clause provides that such right shall not prevent the operation of a law which relates to libel slander defamation contempt of < org > or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the < org > clause thus only emphasizes that while the individual citizen has a free right of speech or expression he cannot be permit ted to use the same to the detriment of a similar right in another citizen or to the detriment of the < org > thus all laws of libel slander contempt of < org > or laws in respect of matters which offend against decency or morality are reaffirmed to be operative in spite of this individual right of the citizen to freedom of speech and expression a similar analysis of clauses and shows similar restrictions imposed on similar grounds in the same way clause also permits reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right to freedom of movement throughout the territory of india the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of india or the right to acquire hold and dispose of property being imposed by law provided such reasonable restrictions on the exercise of such right are in the inter est of the general public reading article in that way it appears to me that the concept of the right to move freely throughout the territo ry of india is an entirely different concept from the right to personal liberty contemplated by article for instance while the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression personal liberty the right to freedom of speech men tioned in article a or the right to acquire hold or dispose of property mentioned in cannot be considered a part of the personal liberty of a citizen they form part of the liberty of a citizen but the limita tion imposed by the word personal leads me to believe that those rights are not covered by the expression personal liberty so read there is no conflict between articles and as already mentioned in respect of each of the rights specified in sub clauses of article specific limitations in respect of each is provided while the expression personal liberty in article is generally controlled by the gener al expression procedure established by law deprivation total loss of personal liberty which inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes or to work or not to work as and when one pleases and sever al such rights sought to be protected by the expression personal liberty in article is quite different from restriction which is", "only a partial control of the right to move freely which is relatively a minor right of a citizen as safeguarded by article this is made clear when the provisions of the criminal procedure code in chapter viii relating to security of peace or maintenance of public order are read therefore article cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty so does article read with schedule seven list i entry and list iii entry therefore when the subject of preventive detention is specifically dealt with in the chapter on fundamental rights i do not think it is proper to consider a legisla tion permitting preventive detention as in conflict with the rights mentioned in article article does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of personal liberty personal liberty would primarily mean liberty of the physical body the rights given under article do not directly come under that description it seems to me improper to read article as dealing with the same subject as article article gives the rights specified therein only to the citizens of india while arti cle is applicable to all persons moreover the protection given by article is very general the legislative restrictions on the law making powers of the legislature are not here prescribed in detail as in the case of the rights specified in article article which is also in part iii under the caption right to freedom runs as follows no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law this article has been strongly relied upon by the peti tioner in support of his contention that the impugned act is ultra vires the < org > as it abridges the right given by this article to every person it was argued that under the constitution of the united states of america the corre sponding provision is found in the th and th amendments where the provision inter alia is that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty or property except by due process of law it was contended for the petitioner that the indian constitution gives the same protection to every person in india except that in the united states due process of law has been it had a wider meaning the word law did not mean enacted law because that will be no legislative protection at all if so construed any act passed by the < org > or < org > which was otherwise within its legislative power can destroy or abridge this right on the same line of reasoning it was argued that if that was the inten tion there was no necessity to put this as a fundamental right in part iii at all they are an objective test i a certain definite and ascer tainable rule of human conduct for the violation of which one can", "be detained notice of the grounds of such detention an impartial tribunal administrative judi cial or advisory to decide whether the detention is justi fied and orderly course of procedure including an opportunity to be heard orally not merely by making a written representation with a right to lead evidence and call witnesses in a constitution the same protection is given to proper ty while in india the fundamental right in respect of property is contained in article it seems unnecessary to embark on a discussion of the powers and jurisdiction of < org > of the a and how they came to enlarge or abridge the meaning of law in the expression due process of law without going into details i think there is no justification to adopt the meaning of the word law as interpreted by < org > of a in the expression due process of law merely because the word law is used in article the discussion of the meaning of due process of law found in willis on constitutional law and in < name > constitutional limitations shows the diverse meanings given to that expression at different times and under dif ferent circumstances by < org > of a so much so that the conclusion reached by these authors is that the expression moreover to control the meaning so given to that expression from time to time the doctrine of police powers was brought into play our attention was drawn to the debates and report of the drafting committee of < org > in respect of the wording of this clause normally read and without thinking of other constitutions the expression procedure established by law must mean procedure prescribed by the law of the state if the indian constitution wanted to preserve to every person the protection given by the due process clause of the ameri can constitution there was nothing to prevent the < org > from adopting the phrase or if they wanted to limit the same to procedure only to adopt that expression with only the word procedural prefixed to law however the correct question is what is the right given by article the only right is that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty except according to procedure established by law this is particularly so when in omitting to adopt due process of law it was considered that the expression procedure established by law made the standard specific if so there appears no reason why in this article it should receive this peculiar meaning article which is also in part iii and relates to the fundamental rights in respect of property runs as follows no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law the object of dealing with property under a differ ent article appears more to provide the exceptions found in article to rather than to give the word law a different meaning than", "the one given in article there is therefore no justification to give the meaning of jus to law in article but other articles of that constitution which expressly pre serve other personal liberties in different clauses have to be read together to determine the meaning of law in the expression procedure established by law under article it is provided that the liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of such except in accord ance with law in article it is provided that no one shall be tried save in due course of law and extraor dinary courts were not permitted to be established except < org > to try military offences < org > gave the expression due course of law the meaning given to it according to the english law and not the american law it was observed by lord < name > in < name > officer administering the government of nigeria that in accordance with british jurispru dence no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a british subject except when he can support the legality of his act before < org > a detailed discussion of the true limits of article will not be necessary if article is considered a code to the extent there are provisions therein for preventive detention connection it may be noticed that the articles in part iii deal with different and separate rights it is obvious that article and prescribe limita tions on the right given by article no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice every person who is arrested and detained in custo dy shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to < org > and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention no law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless a < org > consisting of persons who are or have been or are qualified to be appointed as judges of < org > has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi cient cause for such detention provided that nothing in this sub clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by < org > under sub clause of clause or such person", "is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by < org > under subclauses a and of clause when any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention the authority making the order shall as soon as may be communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order nothing in clause shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of < org > in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid ing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by < org > in an inquiry under sub clause a of clause to the extent the points are dealt with and included or excluded article is a complete code it may be noticed that neither the american nor the japanese constitution contain provisions permitting preventive detention the provisions of article to by their very wording leave unaffected the large powers of legislation on this point and emphasize particularly by article the power of the < org > to deprive a person of a right to have his case considered by an advisory board article in particular are the only restrictions on that power and but for those provisions the power to legislate on this subject would have been quite unrestricted parliament could have made a law without any safeguard or any procedure for preventive detention put in a positive form it will mean that a law which provides for preventive detention for a period longer than three months shall contain a provision establishing an advisory board consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned in sub clause a and which has to report before the expira tion of three months if in its opinion there was sufficient cause for such detention the proviso to this clause further enjoins that even though the advisory board may be of the opinion that there was sufficient cause for such detention i detention beyond the period of three months still the detention is not to be permitted beyond the maximum period if any prescribed by < org > under article article prescribes that when any person under a preventive detention law is detained the authority making the order shall as soon as may be commu nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has", "been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order article permits the authority making the order to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid ers against the public interest to disclose it may be noticed that this clause only permits the non disclosure of facts and reading clauses and together a distinc tion is drawn between facts and grounds of detention they provide for the establishment of an advisory board and the necessity of furnishing grounds to the detenue and also to give him a right to make a represen tation the constitution is silent as to the person to whom it has to be made or how it has to be dealt with it does not therefore mean that if a law made by the < org > in respect of preventive detention does not make provision on those two points it is invalid board is a fundamental right violated by the procedure prescribed in the act passed by the < org > the important clause to be considered is article it was argued that this gives the < org > a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely subclause permits the < org > to lay down the procedure to be followed by the advisory board in an inquiry under sub clause a of clause bearing in mind the provisions of article read with article and schedule vii list i entry and list iii entry it is thus clear that the < org > is empowered to enact a law of preventive detention a for reasons connected with defence for reasons connected with foreign affairs for reasons connected with the security of india and under list iii for reasons connected with the security of a state for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order or for reasons connect ed with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community counsel for the petitioner has challenged the validity of several provisions of the act observed that a constitution must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense i conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it but i do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert the lan guage of the enactment in the interest of any legal or con stitutional theory or even for the purpose of supplying omissions or of correcting supposed errors there is considerable authority for the statement that the < org > are not at liberty to declare an act void because in their opinion it is opposed to a spirit supposed to pervade the constitution but not expressed in words where the funda mental law has not limited either in terms or by necessary implication the general powers conferred upon the legisla ture", "we cannot declare a limitation under the notion of hav ing discovered something in the spirit of the constitution which is not even mentioned in the instrument it is diffi cult upon any general principles to limit the omnipotence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial interposition except so far as the express words of a written constitution give that authority it is also stated if the words be positive and without ambiguity there is no authority for a < org > to vacate or repeal a statute on that ground alone section of the impugned act is no delegation of legislative power to make laws it only confers discretion on the officer to enforce the law made by the legislature it will not be humanly possible to tabulate exhaustively all actions which may lead to a particular object it was also contended that section prescribes no limit of time for detention and therefore the legislation is ultra vires a perusal of the provisions of the impugned act moreover shows that in section provision is made for detention for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year in respect of clauses a and of that section it appears therefore that in respect of the rest of the clauses mentioned in section a the detention is not contem plated to be for a period longer than three months and in such cases a reference to the advisory board under section is contemplated it was argued that this gave only the right of making a representation without being heard orally or without affording an opportu nity to lead evidence and therefore was not an orderly course of procedure as required by the rules of natural justice the < org > by the act has expressly given a right to the person detained under a preventive detention order to receive the grounds for detention and also has given him a right to make a representation that clause which prescribes what procedure has to be followed as a matter of fundamental right is silent about the person detained having a right to be heard orally or by a lawyer the < org > having dealt with the requirements of receiving grounds and giving an opportunity to make a representation has deliberately refrained from providing a right to be heard orally new forms of procedure are as much held even by < org > due process of law as old forms provided they give a person a fair opportunity to present his case it was contended that the right to make a representation in article must carry with it a right to be heard by an independent tribunal otherwise the making of a representation has no substance because it is not an effective remedy article as giving a fundamental right to be heard by an independent tribunal to consider the right", "to make a representation as necessarily including a right to be heard by an independent judicial administrative or advisory tribunal will thus be directly in conflict with the express words of article the right to make a defence may be admitted but there is nothing to support the contention that an oral interview is compulsory both the points were urged before < org > on appeal any more than it would have been bound to disclose all the minutes made on the papers in the office before ho at a decision was come to what appears to me to have been the fallacy of the judgment of the majority in < org > is that it begs the question at the begin ning by setting up the test of the procedure of < org > instead of the other standard which was laid down for such cases in < org > < name > i do not think the board was bound to hear the respondent orally provided it gave him the opportunities he actually had a right to lead evidence against facts suspected to exist is also not essential in the case of preventive deten tion that is one of the clauses of the constitution dealing with fundamental rights if even the non disclosure of facts is permitted i fail to see how there can exist a right to contest facts by evidence and the noninclusion of such procedural right could make this act invalid section was challenged on the ground that it excludes the right to appear in person or by any lawyer before the advisory board and it was argued that this was an infringement of a fundamental right it must be noticed that article which gives a detained person a right to consult or be defended by his own legal practitioner is specifically excluded by article in the case of legislation dealing with preventive detention the < org > is expressly given power under article to lay down the procedure in an inquiry by an advisory board in my opinion this argument has nos substance because the act has to be read as a whole section of the impugned act is challenged on the ground that it does not conform to the provisions of article in my opinion this argument is unsound because the words used in article themselves are against such interpretation intended that the power of preventive detention beyond three months may be exercised either if the circumstances in which or the class or classes of cases in which a person is suspected or apprehended to be doing the objectionable things mentioned in the section it was next contended that by section the < org > had provided that a person might be detained for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board with a view to", "prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of india rela tions of india with foreign powers or the security of india or the security of a < org > or the maintenance of public order the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner on this point does not appeal to me because it assumes that the words of schedule vii list i entry and list iii entry are never capable of being considered as circum stances or classes of cases in my opinion that assumption is not justified particularly when we have to take into consideration cases of preventive detention and not of conviction and punitive detention the classification of cases having regard to an object may itself amount to a description of the circumstances if so there appears no reason why the same expression when used in section a and of the impugned act should not be held to have such specific meaning and thus comply with the requirement of prescribing circumstances or classes of cases there is nothing in the chapter on fundamental rights and in article or to prevent the inclusion of such a clause in a parliamentary legislation permitting preventive detention when in specified circumstances and classes of cases the preventive detention exceeds three months the absence of an advisory board is expressly per mitted by article as regards an opportunity to be heard there is no absolute natural right recognised in respect of oral representation it has been held to depend on the nature of the tribunal the right to make a representation is affirmed by the constitution in article and finds a place in the impugned act the right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it is guaranteed by article read with article and by article a and has also been thus provided in the act it seems to me therefore that the petitioner contentions even on these points fail section was strongly attacked on the ground that it violated all principles of natural justice and even in fringed the right given by article of the constitu tion no < org > shall except for the purposes of a prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection allow any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any communication made under section of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order and notwithstanding anything contained in any other law no < org > shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it or to disclose the substance of any such communication or representation made or the proceedings of < org > or that part of the report of < org > which is confidential it shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with", "both for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of < org > or < org > as the case may be any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub section provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order the < org > has the right under article not to disclose facts which it considers undesirable to disclose in the public interest moreover the position is made clear by the words of article it provides that the detaining authority shall communicate to such detained person the grounds on which the order has been made to urge this argument the aggrieved party must have a right to intimate to the < org > the grounds given for the alleged detention and the representation made by him if the detained person is not in a position to put before the < org > this paper the < org > will be prevented from considering whether the requirements of article are complied with and that is a right which is guaranteed to every person it seems to me therefore that the provisions therefore the decision that section is ultra vires does not affect the validity of the rest of the act < name > question to be decided in this case is whether the preventive detention act act iv of is wholly or in part invalid and whether the peti tioner who has been detained under that act is entitled to a writ in the nature of habeas corpus on the ground that his detention is illegal the question being a pure question of law can he decided without referring to a long chain of facts which are narrated in the petitioner application to this court and which have a more direct bearing on the alleged mala fides of the authorities who have detained him than on the validity of the act things done or omit ted to be done before that date section a provides that the central government or < org > may a if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to i the defence of india the relations of india with foreign powers or the security of india or ii the security of the < org > or the maintenance of public order or iii the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community or if satisfied with respect to any person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the foreigners act xxxi of that with a view to regulating his continued presence in india or with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from india it is necessary so to do make an order directing that such person be", "detained sub sections and of this section empower a district magistrate sub divisional magistrate or the com missioner of police in a presidency town to exercise the power conferred by and make the order contemplated in sub section but with the qualification that any order made thereunder must be reported forthwith to the < org > of the state to which the officer in question is subordinate with the grounds on which the order has been made and such other particulars as in his opinion have a bearing on the necessity for the order section of the act provides that the authority making an order of detention shall as soon as may be communicate to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order in a case where such order has been made by < org > to that < org > and in a case where it has been made by a state < org > or an officer subor dinate thereto to the state < org > section pro vides that when a detention order has been made with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community or if it is made in regard to a person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the foreigners act with a view to regulating his continued presence in india or making arrangements for his expulsion from india the grounds on which the order has been made and the representation if any section lays down the procedure to be followed by the advisory board and section provides that in any case where the advisory board has reported that there is sufficient cause for the detention of the person concerned the detention order may be confirmed and the detention of the person concerned may be continued for such period as < org > or < org > as the case may be thinks fit which is a very important section as we shall presently see runs as follows any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of < org > for a period longer than three months but not exceed ing one year from the date of his detention namely where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of india relations of india with foreign powers or the security of india

months from the date of his detention", "be reviewed where the order was made by the central government or a state government by such govern ment and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub section of section by < org > to which such officer is subordinate in consultation with a person who is or has been or is qualified to be appointed as judge of < org > nominated in that behalf by < org > or < org > as the case may be section which is also a material section for the purpose of this case is to the following effect no < org > shall except for the purposes of a prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection allow any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any communication made under section of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order and not withstanding anything contained in any other law no < org > shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it or to disclose the substance of any such commu nication or representation made or the proceedings of < org > or that part of the report of < org > which is

nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order the point which has been pressed before us is that the act is invalid as it takes away or abridges certain funda mental rights conferred by part iii of the constitution of india and in support of this general proposition reliance is placed on article which runs as follows the state shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void the rights guaranteed under part iii of the constitution are classified under seven broad heads as follows right to equality right to freedom right against exploitation right to freedom of religion cultural and educational rights right to property and right to constitutional remedies article is divided into seven sub clauses and runs as follows all citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely", "throughout the territory of india to reside and settle in any part of the territory of india to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business clauses and of this article pro vide that nothing in clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in regard to the rights under that clause under certain conditions which are mentioned there in clause with which we are directly concerned and which will serve as a specimen to show the nature of these provisions is to the following effect nothing in sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the state from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner with reference to this article are that the act under which he has been detained deprives him who is a citizen of the republic of india of the right to move freely throughout the territory of india which is guaran teed under article and that under clause of article it is open to this court to judge whether the restrictions imposed by the act on the exercise of the right conferred by article are reasonable or otherwise before dealing with this argument it is necessary to understand the meaning of the words used in article and to have a clear compre hension as to the true nature of the right conferred there under the contention put forward on behalf of the peti tioner is that freedom of movement is the essence of person al liberty and any restraint on freedom of movement must be held to amount to abridgment or deprivation of personal liberty as the case may be according to the nature of the restraint after very careful consideration i have come to the conclusion that this contention is well founded in law but the fact that he controls its movements for ever so short a time is an offence against the king peace for no one has the right to molest another in his free movements in wrongful restraint there is only a partial suspension of one liberty of locomotion while in wrongful confinement there is a total suspension of liberty beyond certain circum scribing limits but it is contended on behalf of the < org > that freedom of move how the use of the expression throughout the territory of india can qualify the meaning of the rest of the words used in the article is a matter beyond my compre hension throughout is an amplifying and not a limiting expression and i am sur prised to find that the expression throughout the territory", "of india which was used to give the widest possible scope to the freedom of movement is sought to be construed as an expression limiting the scope and nature of the freedom in my opinion the words throughout the territory of india having regard to the context in which they have been used here have the same force and meaning as the expression to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct used by < name > or the expression freedom to be able to go whithersoever one pleases used by < name > in < name > < name > the question as to whether preventive detention is an encroachment on the right guaranteed by article has been considered by the nagpur patna and calcutta < org > been ultimately adopted by these < org > is that preventive detention is not a violation of the right guaranteed by article but in the calcutta who have held the contrary view appears to be the same having regard to the fact that the view expressed by so many learned judges is opposed to the view i am inclined to take i consider it necessary to deal briefly with the main objections which have been raised in support of the narrow meaning sought to be attached to the words in article i it will be recalled that clause of article which i have already quoted in full provides among other things that nothing in clause shall affect the operation of any law present or future imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right of freedom of movement either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe it has been argued that the use of the words interests of any scheduled tribe in this clause shows that the right guaranteed by article is a limited right of movement such as the right to visit different localities and to go from one place to another and is different from the expression freedom of movement which has been stated by < org > to be another name for personal liberty it is pointed out that the restrictions in contemplation here are mainly restrictions preventing undesirable outsiders from visiting scheduled areas and exploiting scheduled tribes and if the words freedom of movement had been used in the larger sense such a small matter would not have found a place in clause of article i must frankly confess that i am unable to appreciate this argument and to hold that a mere reference to scheduled tribes affects the plain meaning of the words used in clause of article the words used in article are very wide and mean that a person can go at his will in any direction to any locality and to any distance the framers of the constitution wanted to save all restrictive legislation", "affecting freedom of movement made in the interests of the general public which expression means the same thing as public interests and i think that the law in regard to preventive detention is fully covered by the expression restrictions imposed in the public interests but they also remembered that there were restrictive laws made in the interests of an important community and that similar laws may have to be made in future and hence they added the words for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe it may at first sight appear to be a relatively small matter but in their anxiety to cover the whole field of restrictive laws made whether in the public interest or in the interests of a particular community and not to leave the smallest loophole the framers of the constitution apparently decided to draft the clause in the present form as far as i am aware there are no restrictive laws made in the interests of any commu nity other than the scheduled tribes and i think clause is sufficiently comprehensive to include the smallest as well as the most complete restrictions on freedom of move ment this ordinance provides for the apprehension and detention in custody of any person whom the authority empowered by the rules to appre hend or detain as the case may be suspects on grounds appearing to such authority to be reasonable of being of hostile origin or of having acted acting being about to act or being likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or interest the defence of british india the maintenance of public order his majesty relations with foreign powers or indian states the maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas or the efficient prosecution of the war or with respect to whom such authority is satisfied that his apprehension and detention are necessary for the purpose of preventing him from acting in any such prejudi cial manner the prohibition of such person from entering or residing or remaining in any area and the compelling of such person to reside and remain in any area or to do or abstain from doing anything the points to be noted in connection with the ordinance are that it is an ordinance specifically providing for apprehension and detention that notwithstanding the fact that there is a gener al reference in it to acts prejudicial to public safety or interests and maintenance of public order there is also a specific reference to maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas that tribal areas and scheduled tribes are kindred subjects as would appear from the fifth schedule appended to the constitution and that maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas may be as much in the public interest as in the inter ests of persons living in those areas this ordinance shows at least this much that sometimes the law of", "preventive detention can also be made in the interests of scheduled tribes or scheduled areas and conse quently the mere mention of scheduled tribes in clause does not necessarily exclude laws relating to preventive detention from the scope of article the same remarks apply to the ordinance called the restriction and detention ordinance ordinance no iii of which empow ered the central government or < org > to detain and make orders restricting the movements of certain persons in the interest of public safety maintenance of public order as well as maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas etc it is also argued that since preventive detention amounts to a total deprivation of freedom of movement it is not a violation of the right granted under article in regard to which the word restriction and not deprivation has been used in clause this argument also does not appeal to me there are really two questions which fall to be decided in this case viz a does pre ventive detention take away the right guaranteed by article and if so what are the consequences if any it seems obvious to me that preventive detention amounts to a complete deprivation of the right guaranteed by article in my opinion having regard to the context in which the word restriction has been used there is no antithesis between that word and the word depriva tion it appears that some of the judges who had to deal with the question which we have before us were greatly influenced by the argument that if the deprivation of per sonal liberty amounts to deprivation of the right granted under article any conviction for an offence under the indian penal code involving a sentence of impris onment will be subject to judicial review on the ground of reasonableness of the provisions of the code under which the conviction is recorded it would mean that every law under which a person may be imprisoned including all the provisions of the penal code is open to examination by the < org > on the ground of reasonableness it makes the < org > supreme arbiters in regard to any such legislation and they can reject it or accept it in accordance with their ideas of whether it appeals to their reason the obvious and strictly legal reply to this argument is that the consideration which has so greatly weighed with the learned chief justice is not enough to cut down the plain meaning of the general words used in article of the constitution as has been pointed out in a number of cases in construing enacted words we are not concerned with the policy involved or with the results injurious or otherwise which may follow by giving effect to the language used king emperor < name > and others i apart from this aspect of the matter i agree with one of the learned judges", "of < org > in his remark that no calamitous or untoward result will follow even if the provisions of the penal code become justiciable it seems to me that this court should not be deterred from giving effect to a fundamental right granted under the constitution merely because of a vague and unfounded fear that something catas trophic may happen i have so far proceeded on the assumption that the basis of the objection raised by < name > is correct in law but in my opinion it is not section of the indian penal code provides that every person shall be liable to punishment under this code and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions there of of which he shall be guilty within british india the indian penal code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely the punishment may consist in imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty if it consists in a pecuniary penalty it obviously involves no restriction on movement but if it consists in imprisonment there is a restriction on movement this restraint is imposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining crime and making it punishable the punishment is correlated directly with the violation of some other person right and not with the right of at in my opinion therefore the indian penal code does not come within the ambit of the words law imposing restriction on the right to move freely a person is punitively detained only after a trial for committing a crime and after his guilt has been established in a compe tent court of justice a person so convicted can take his case to < org > and sometimes bring it to this court also and he can in the course of the proceedings connected with his trial take all pleas available to him including the plea of want of jurisdiction of < org > and the invalidity of the law under which he has been prosecuted the final judgment in the criminal trial will thus constitute a serious obstacle in his way if he chooses to assert even after his conviction that his right under article has been violated but a person who is preventively detained has not to face such an obstacle whatever other obstacle may be in his way it was pointed out that article being confined to citizens the anomalous situation will follow that in cases of preventive detention a citizen will be placed in a better position than a non citizen because if a citizen is detained his detention will be open to some kind of judicial review under article but if a non citizen has been detained his case will not be open to such review it is equally clear that", "restric tions on those rights are to a limited extent at least open to judicial review the very same question which is raised in regard to article will arise with regard to most of the other sub clauses a citizen has the right to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions and so on if there is any law imposing unreason able restrictions on any of these rights that law will not be good law so far as citizens are concerned but it may be good law so far as non citizens are concerned if a citizen has been granted certain other additional protections under article there is no anomaly involved in the discrimination it was contended that the rights declared by article are the rights of a free citizen and if he has already been deprived of his liberty in the circumstances referred to in articles and then it would be idle to say that he still enjoys the right referred to in article after giving my fullest consideration to this argument i have not been able to appreciate how it arises in this case there is nothing in article go suggest that it applies only to those cases which do not fall under articles and this is the only question which arises in the case and it should not be obscured by any abstruse or metaphysical considerations it is true that if you put a man under detention he cannot move and therefore he is not in a position to exercise the right guaranteed under article but this is only the physical aspect of the matter and a person who is bed ridden on account of disease suffers from a similar disability if he has been detained under some provision of law imposing restrictions on the freedom of movement then the question will arise whether the restrictions are reasonable if he has been detained under no provision of law or under some law which is invalid he must be set at liberty to my mind the scheme of the chapter dealing with the fundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it namely that each article is a code by itself and is independent of the others the case of a person who is convicted of an offence will come under articles and and also under article so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned preventive detention which is dealt with in article also amounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is referred to in article and is a violation of the right of freedom of movement dealt with in article that there are other instances of overlapping of articles in the constitution may be illus trated by reference to article and article both of which deal with the right to property and to some extent overlap each other it appears that some learned <", "org > judges who had to deal with the very question before us were greatly impressed by the statement in the report of < org > on article corresponding to the present article that the word liberty should be qualified by the insertion of the word personal before it for otherwise it may be construed very widely so as to include the freedoms dealt with in article corresponding to the present article i am not however prepared to hold that this statement is decisive on the question of the construction of the words used in article which are quite plain and can be construed without any extraneous help whether the report of the drafting commit tee and the debates on the floor of the < org > should be used at all in construing the words of a statute which are words of ordinary and common use and are not used in any technical or peculiar sense is a debatable question and whether they can be used in aid of a construction which is a strain upon the language used in the clause to be interpreted is a still more doubtful matter but apart from these legal consider ations it is i think open to us to analyse the statement and see whether it goes beyond adding a somewhat plausible reason a superficially plausible reason for a slight verbal change in article it seems clear that the addi tion of the word personal before liberty in article cannot change the meaning of the words used in article nor can it put a matter which is inseparably bound up with personal liberty beyond its place personal liberty and personal freedom in spite of the use of the word personal are as we find in several books sometimes used in a wide sense and embrace freedom of speech freedom of a general statement by < org > referring to freedom in plural cannot take the place of an authoritative exposition of the meaning of the words used in article which has not been specifically referred to and cannot be such an overriding consideration as to compel us to put a meaning opposed to reason and authority the words used in article must be construed as they stand and we have to decide upon the words themselves whether in the but as i shall point out later however literally we may construe the words used in article and however restricted may be the meaning we may attribute to those words there can be no escape from the conclusion that preventive detention is a direct infringe ment of the right guaranteed in article the expressions per sonal liberty and personal freedom have as we find in several books a wider meaning and also a narrower meaning i have shown that the juristic conception of personal liberty when these words are used in the sense of immunity from arrest is with these facts in", "view i have tried to find out whether there is any freedom of movement known in england apart from personal liberty used in the sense of immunity from arrest and detention but i find no trace of any such freedom similar classifications will be found in < name > introduc tion to the study of the law of the constitution and < name > constitutional law and other books on constitu tional subjects but there is no reference anywhere to any freedom or right of movement in the sense in which we are asked to construe the words used in article in the constitutions of america ireland and many other countries where freedom is prized there is no reference to freedom or right of movement as something distinct from personal liberty used in the sense of immunity from arrest and confinement it is only in the constitution of the free city of danzig which covers an area of square miles that we find these words in article all nationals shall enjoy freedom of movement within the city there is however no authoritative opinion available to support the view that this freedom is anything different from what is otherwise called personal liberty such being the general position i am confirmed in my view that the juristic conception that personal liberty and freedom of movement connote the same thing is the correct and true conception and the words used in article must be construed according to this universally accepted legal conception in the first world war < org > passed the defence of the realm consoli dation act in and a number of regulations were made under it including regulation which permitted the secretary of < org > to subject any person to such obliga tions and restrictions as hereinafter mentioned in view of his hostile origin or associations lord < name > in refer ring to this regulation said in < name > sir < name > that the regulation undisputedly gave to a secretary of < org > unrestricted power to detain a suspected person the matter ultimately came up before < org > in < name > < name > and the noble lords in dealing with the case proceeded on the assumption that there was no difference between internment and incarceration or imprisonment his person was seized he has been interned the appellant lost his liberty and was interned he then proceeded to state that there was no difference between internment and imprisonment and quoted the following passage from < name > the confinement of the person in any wise is an imprisonment again lord < name > while dealing with the merits of the case made the following observations if the legislature chooses to enact that he can be deprived of his liberty and incarcerated or interned for certain things for which he could not", "have been heretofore incarcerated or interned that enactment and the orders made under it if intra vires do not infringe upon the habeas corpus acts or take away any right conferred by magna charta the classifica tion is important because it meets two principal arguments advanced in this case it shows firstly that detention is a form of restriction and secondly that it is a restriction on movement in < name > case in construing the provi sions of the act of viscount < name > observed as follows the language of the act of above cited shows beyond doubt that defence regulations may be made which must deprive the subject whose detention appears to the secre tary of < org > to be expedient in the interests of public safety of all his liberty of movement while the regulations remain in force the classification that we find in the defence of the realm regulations was with a little verbal modification adopted in the defence of india rules and we find that here also rule which dealt with preventive detention has been placed under the heading restriction of movements and activities of persons in one of the acts the same advisory board is to deal with the case of a detenue as well as that of an externed person and there are also similar provisions giving them the right to represent their case to the government i will now assume for the sake of argument that the freedom of movement to which reference is made in article has nothing to do with personal liberty and that the words which occur in the article bear the restricted meaning attributed to them by the learned attorney general and some of my colleagues it seems to me that even on this assump tion it is difficult to arrive at any conclusion other than what i have already arrived at we have only to ask ourselves does a person who is detained retain even a fraction of his freedom of movement in howsoever restricted sense the term may be used and does he not lose his right to move freely from one place to another or visit any locality he likes as a necessary result of his detention i think i should refer here once more to the fact that in the defence of the realm regula tions and defence of india rules preventive detention is classed under the heading restriction of movements and activities movement is here used in plural and refers to that very type of movement which is said to be protected by article moving from one state or place to another visiting different localities etc the same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed i am however interested to find that the patna and bombay high courts have", "held that a person who is externed can successfully assert that the right granted to him under article has been violated this view has not been seriously challenged before us and if it is correct i really do not see how it can be held that preventive deten tion is also not a direct invasion of the right guaranteed in article perhaps one may pause here to ask what kind of laws were in contemplation of the framers of the constitution when they referred to laws imposing re strictions in the public interest in article i think the war laws and the provincial act and ordinances to which i have already referred must have been among them these being laws which expressly purport to impose restrictions on movements if so we should not overlook the fact that preventive detention was an inseparable part of these laws and was treated as a form of restriction on movement and classified as such it seems to me that when the matter is seriously considered it would be found that the interpreta tion of the learned attorney general attracts the operation of article no less strongly and directly than the interpretation i have suggested and i prefer the latter only because i consider that it is legally unsound to treat what is inseparably bound up with and is the essential element in the legal concept of personal liberty as a wholly separate and unconnected entity it was pointed out in the course of the arguments that preventive detention not only takes away the right in article but also takes away all the other rights guaranteed by article except the right to hold acquire and dispose of property where exactly this argu ment is intended to lead us to i cannot fully understand but it seems to me that it involves an obvious fallacy because it overlooks the difference in the modes in which preventive detention operates on the right referred to in sub clause and other sub clauses of article one who is preventively detained is straightaway deprived of his right of movement as a direct result of his detention but he loses the other rights only in consequence of his losing freedom of movement i wish only to add that when i said that i was not able to understand the full force of the argument which i have tried to deal with what i had in mind was that if preventive detention sweeps away or affects almost all the rights guaranteed in article being fully alive to the fact that it is a serious matter to be asked to declare a law enacted by < org > to be unconstitutional i have again and again asked myself the question what are we to put in the scales against the construction which i am inclined to adopt and in", "favour of the view that preventive detention does not take away the freedom of movement guaranteed in article the inevitable answer has always been that while in one of the scales we have plain and unambiguous language the opinion eminent jurists judicial dicta of high authority constitu tional practice in the sense that no constitution refers to any freedom of movement apart from personal liberty and the manner in which preventive detention has been treated in the very laws on which our law on this subject is based all that we can put in the opposite scale is a vague and ill rounded apprehension that some fearful object such as the revision of the penal code is looming obscurely in the distant horizon the peculiar objection that the mere men tion of the scheduled tribes will alter the meaning of certain plain words the highly technical and unreal dis tinction between restriction and deprivation and the assump tion not warranted by any express provision that a person who is preventively detained cannot claim the right of freedom of movement because he is not a free man and certain other things which whether taken singly or collectively are too unsubstantial to carry any weight in these circum stances i am strongly of the view that article guarantees the right of freedom of movement in its widest sense that freedom of movement being the essence of person al liberty the right guaranteed under the article is really a right to personal liberty and that preventive detention is a deprivation of that right i am also of the view that even on the interpretation suggested by the learned attor ney general preventive detention cannot but be held to be a violation of the right conferred by article the scope of the review is simply to see whether any particular law imposes any unreasonable restrictions considering that the restrictions are imposed on a most valuable right there is nothing revolutionary in the legislature trusting < org > to examine whether an act which infringes upon that right is within the limits of reason i will now pass on to the consideration of article which runs as follows no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law the only words which cause some difficulty in the proper construction of the article are procedure established by law the learned attorney general contended before us that the word law which is used in article means state made law or law enacted by the state on the other hand the learned counsel for the petitioner strongly contended that the expression procedure established by law is used in a much wider sense and approximates in meaning to the expres sion due process of law as interpreted by < org > in the earlies", "##t times and if that is so it means exactly what some of the american writers mean to convey by the expression procedural due process in the course of the arguments the learned attorney general referred us to the proceedings in < org > for the purpose of showing that the article as originally drafted contained the words without due process of law but these words were subsequently replaced by the words except according to procedure established by law in my opinion though the proceedings or discussions in the < org > are not relevant for the purpose of construing the meaning of the expressions used in article especially when they are plain and unambiguous they are relevant to show that the < org > intended to avoid the use of the expression without due process of law in the reign of edward iii however the words due process of law were used in a statute guaranteeing that no person will be de prived of his property or imprisoned or indicted or put to death without being brought in to answer by due process of law edward iii ch iii the expression was used in such a wide sense that the judges found it difficult to define it and in one of the cases it was ob served as follows it would be difficult and perhaps impossible to give to those words a definition at once accurate and broad enough to cover every case it seems plain that < org > did not adopt this expression on account of the very elastic meaning given to it but preferred to use the words according to procedure established by law which occur in the japanese constitution framed in one of the character istics of the constitution which undoubtedly bespeaks of direct american influence is to be found in a lengthy chap ter consisting of articles entitled rights and duties of the people which provided for the first time an effec tive bill of rights for the japanese people now there are two matters which deserve to be noticed that the japanese constitution was framed wholly under american influence and that at the time it was framed the trend of judicial opinion in america was in favour of confining the meaning of the expression due process of law to what is expressed by certain american writers by the somewhat quaint but useful expression proce dural due process that there was such a trend would be clear from the following passage which i quote from < name > the growth of constitutional power in the united states page in the circumstances mentioned it seems permissible to surmise that the expression procedure established by law as used in the japanese constitution represented the current trend of american judicial opinion with regard to due process of law and if that is so the expression as used in our constitution means all that the", "american writers have read into the words procedural due process but generally the word law has a wider meaning when used in the abstract sense without being preceded by an article now whatever may be the meaning of the expression due process of law the word law is common to that expression as well as procedure established by law and though we are not bound to adopt the construction put on law or due process of law in america yet since a number of eminent american judges have devoted much thought to the subject i am not prepared to hold that we can derive no help from their opinions and we should completely ignore them decisions of < org > construing the word law as used in the expression due process of law in so far as it bears on the question of legal procedure so far as orderly course of proce dure is concerned he explains that it does not require a < org > to strictly weigh the evidence but it does require it to examine the entire record to ascertain the issues to discover whether there are facts not reported and to see whether or not the law has been correctly applied to facts the view expressed by other writers is practically the same as that expressed by professor < name > though some of them do not expressly refer to the fourth element viz such a case can happen if the < org > expressly takes away the right in question in an emergency as the british < org > did during the last two world wars in a limited number of cases i will refer here to a few cases which show that the fundamental principle that a person whose right is affected must be heard has been observed not only in cases involving personal liberty but also in proceedings affecting other rights even though they may have come before administrative or quasi judicial tribunals < name > < org > was a case under an act which empowered < org > to alter or demol ish a house where the builder had neglected to give notice of his intention that being so a long course of decisions beginning with dr < name > case and ending with some very recent cases establish that although there are no positive words in a statute requiring that the party shall be heard yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature in the last mentioned case he observed as follows it < name > < name > contains a very valuable state ment by the lord chief baron as to his view of the mode of administering justice by persons other than judges who have judicial functions to perform which i should have been very glad to have had before me on both those club cases that i recently heard namely the case of", "< name > < name > and the case of < name > earl of < name > additional powers act which contained a provision that an appeal could in certain cases be properly determined without a hearing and that the appellate court could dis pense with the hearing and determine the appeal summarily it was held that the meaning of rule was that the tribunal on appeal might dispense with an oral hearing not that they might dispense with a hearing of any kind and that they were bound to give the appellants a hearing in the sense of an opportunity to make out a case the earl of reading in delivering the judgment observed the principle of law applicable to such a case is well stated by < name > in < name > < name > in a passage which is cited with approval by lord < name > in < name > < org > in < org > < name > < org > dismissed an appeal by a person against whom a closing order had been made under housing town planning the principle however was conceded and lucidly set forth that when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially and they must deal with the question referred to them without bias and must give to each of the parties an opportunity of presenting its case and that the decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of respon sibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice commenting upon this case which is generally regarded as an extreme case mr < name > who afterwards became a member of < org > observes a i think you would agree that if the subjectmatter of such proceedings as arc here indicated was the liberty of the subject or indeed his life you would regard such a judicial procedure as outrageous i have particularly referred to cases which were before administrative tribunals because i have to deal in this case with preventive detention which is said to be an execu tive act and because i wish to point out that even before executive authorities and administrative tribunals an order cannot generally be passed affecting one rights without giving one such hearing as may be appropriate to the circum stances of the case adds it seems to me that there should be added to this list the following rights which appear to have become well estab lished the right of the subject to have any case affecting him tried in accordance with the principles of natural justice particularly the principles that a man may not be a judge in his own cause and that no party ought to be con demned unheard or to have a decision given against him", "unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of putting forward his case halsbury laws of england nd edition volume page the whole of the criminal procedure code whether it deals with trial of offences or with preventive or quasiadministrative measures such as are contemplated in sections and is based upon the foundation of this principle and it is difficult to see that it has not become part of the law of the land and does not inhere in our system of law if that is so then procedure established by law must include this principle whatever else it may or may not include that the word law used in article does not mean only < org > made law is clear from the fact that though there is no statute laying down the complete procedure to be adopted in contempt of < org > cases when the contempt is not within the view of the < org > yet such procedure as now prevails in these cases is part of our law the statute law which regulates the procedure of trials and enquiries in criminal cases does not specifically provide for arguments in certain cases but it has always been held that no decision should be pronounced without hearing arguments i am aware that some judges have ex pressed a strong dislike for the expression natural jus tice on the ground that it is too vague and elastic but where there are well known principles with no vagueness about them which all systems of law have respected and recognized they cannot be discarded merely because they are in the ultimate analysis found to be based on natural jus tice that the expression natural justice is not unknown to our law is apparent from the fact that < org > has in many criminal appeals from this country laid down that it shall exercise its power of interference with the course of criminal justice in this country when there has been a breach of principles of natural justice or departure from the requirements of justice in the present case there is no vagueness about the right claimed which is the right to have one guilt or innocence considered by an impartial body and that right must be read into the words of article in the course of his arguments the learned counsel for the petitioner repeatedly asked whether the constitution would permit a law being enacted abolishing the mode of trial permitted by the existing law and establishing the procedure of trial by battle or trial by ordeal which was in vogue in olden times in england the question envisages something which is not likely to happen but it does raise a legal problem which can perhaps be met only in tiffs way that if the expression procedure established by law simply means any procedure", "established or enacted by statute it will be difficult to give a negative answer to the question but ii the word law includes what i have endeavoured to show it does such an answer may be justified it seems to me that there is nothing revolutionary in the doctrine that the words procedure established by law must include the four principles set out in professor < name > book which as i have already stated are different aspects of the same principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about them i have only to add that it has not been seriously controverted that law in this article means valid law and procedure means certain definite rules of proceeding and not something which is a mere pretence for procedure i will now proceed to examine article of the consti tution which specifically deals with the subject a i the correct position is that article must prevail in so far as there are specific provisions therein regarding preventive detention but where there are no such provisions in that article the operation of articles and cannot be excluded i will now proceed to analyse the article and deal with its main provisions in my opinion the main provisions of this article are that no person can be detained beyond three months without the report of an advisory board clause a that the < org > may prescribe the circumstances and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for more than three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board clause a that when a person is preventively detained the author ity making the order of detention shall communicate to such person the grounds on which the order is made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa tion against the order clause and that the < org > may prescribe the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention clause if the first interpreta tion is correct then the function of the advisory board would be to go into the merits of the case of each person and simply report whether there was sufficient cause for his detention according to the other interpretation the function of the advisory board will be to report to the government whether there is sufficient cause for the person being detained for more than three months the next question which we have to discuss relates to the meaning and scope of article a which runs as follows parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven tive detention without obtaining the opinion of < org > in accordance with the provisions", "of sub clause a of clause this question has arisen because of the way in which these ex pressions appear to have been interpreted and applied in the act of < org > with which we are concerned as the matter is important and somewhat complicated i shall try to express my meaning as clearly as possible even at the risk of some repetition and in doing so i must necessarily refer to the impugned act as well as lists i and iii of the seventh schedule of the constitution under which < org > had jurisdiction to enact it item of list i union list shows that the < org > has power to legislate on preventive detention for reasons connected with defence foreign affairs and security of india under list iii concurrent list the appropriate item is item which shows that law as to preventive detention can be made for reasons connected with the security of the < org > the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community < org > or < org > may a if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to i the defence of india the relations of india with foreign powers or the security of india or ii the security of the < org > or the maintenance of public order or iii the maintenance of supplies and services essen tial to the community or if satisfied with respect to any person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the foreigners act xxxi of that with a view to regulating his continued presence in india or with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from india it is necessary so to do make an order directing that such person be detained these two subjects i shall refer to as and in sub clause iii reference has been made to the third matter in item of list iii and i shall refer to this subject as with this classification let us now turn to the constitution itself if the case contemplated in clause a is the rule and that contem plated in clause a is the exception then the circum stances and the class or classes of cases must be of a special or extraordinary nature so as to take the case out of the rule and bring it within the exception but this is precisely what has been done in this case all the items on which preventive legislation is possible excepting one i a to have been put within the exception and only one which relates to maintenance of supplies and services essen tial to the community has been allowed to remain under the rule the learned attorney general maintained that it would have been open to the < org > to dispense with", "the advisory board even for the category and if such a course had been adopted it would not have affected the validity of the act i may state here that two views are put forward before us as to how clauses a and a of article are to be read that clause a lays down the rule that in all cases where detention for more than three months is ordered it should be done in consultation with and on the report of the advisory board and clause a lays down an exception to this rule by providing that < org > may pass an act permitting detention for more than three months without reference to an advisory board that clauses a and a are independent clauses making two separate and alternative provisions regarding detention for more than three months in one case on the report of an advisory board and in other case without reference to an advisory board looking at the substance and not merely at the words i am inclined to hold that clause a practically engrafts an exception on the rule that preventive detention for more than three months can be ordered only on the report of an advisory board and so far i have proceeded on that footing but it seems to me that it will make no difference to the ulti mate conclusion whichever of the two views we may adopt even on the latter view it must be recognized that the law which the constitution enables the < org > to make under article a would be an exceptionally drastic law and on the principle that an exceptionally drastic law must be intended for an exceptional situation every word of what i have said so far must stand it was urged that the word and which occurs between circumstances and class or classes of cases is used in a disjunctive sense and should be read as or and by way of illustration it was mentioned that when it is said that a person may do this and that it means that he is at liberty to do either this or that i think that clause a can be accurately paraphrased somewhat as follows parliament may dispense with an advisory board but in that case it shall prescribe the circumstances and the class or classes of cases supposing it was said that parliament may prescribe the time and place for the doing of a thing then can it be suggested that both time and place should not be prescribed it seems obvious to me that the class or classes of cases must have some reference to the persons to be detained or to their activities and movements or to both at first sight it seemed to me to be a plausible argument but the more i think about it the more unsound it appears to me under the constitution the < org > has to prescribe", "the class or classes acting within the limits of the power granted to it under lists i and iii under the lists one of the subjects on which < org > may make a law of preventive detention is matter connected with the maintenance of public order the act simply repeats this phraseology and states in sec tion with a view to preventing him the person to be detained from acting in a manner prejudicial to the main tenance of public order i think that article a contemplates that the graver and more heinous types of acts falling within the category of acts prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or other heads should be prescribed so as to define and cir cumscribe the area of an exceptional piece of legislation these classes are much more specific than what we find in section a of the impugned act and therefore there is less chance of misuse by the executive of the power to order preventive detention the classes set out are these if the secretary of < org > has reasonable cause to believe any person to be of hostile origin or associa tions if the secretary of < org > has reasonable cause to believe any person to have been recently concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm or in the preparation or instigation of such acts if the secretary of < org > has reasonable cause to believe any person to have been or to be a member of or to have been or to be active in the furtherance of the objects of any such organization as is hereinafter mentioned a the organization is subject to foreign influence or control the persons in control of the organization have or have had associations with persons concerned in the government of or sympathies with the system of government of any power with which his majesty is at war and in either case there is danger of the utilization of the organization for pur poses prejudicial to the public safety etc if the secretary of < org > has reasonable cause to believe that the recent conduct of any person for the time being in an area or any words recently written or spoken by such a person expressing sympathy with the enemy indicates or indicate that person is likely to assist the enemy i have only to point out that the scope within which preventive detention can be legislat ed upon in this country is much larger than the scope indi cated in the british act under which regulation was framed and therefore there is more scope for specification of the circumstances as well as the class or classes of cases under the impugned act there was some discussion at the < org > as to", "what kind of circumstances might have been specified it is not for me to answer this question but i apprehend that an impending rebellion or war serious disorder in a particular area such as has induced < org > to declare certain areas as disturbed areas tense communal situation prevalence of sabotage or widespread political dacoities and a variety of other matters might answer the purpose the constitution had in view it appears to me that article deals with three classes of preventive detention preventive detention for three months preventive detention for more than three months on the report of the advisory board and preventive detention for more than three months without reference to the advisory board now so far as the first two classes are concerned there is nothing to be prescribed under the constitution apparently the authors of the constitution were not much concerned about class no and they thought that in so far as class no was concerned the provision that a reference to the advisory board was necessary coupled with the provision that detention was not to exceed the maximum period which may be fixed by the < org > was enough but they did take care to make a special provision for class no and it is extermly important for the liberty of the subject as well as for the smooth working of the constitu tion that this provision should not be lightly treated but should receive a well considered and reasonable construc tion it is elementary that the rigour of a law should correspond to or fit the gravity of the evil or danger it aims at combating and it is also evident that the law which the < org > has been permitted to enact under article a can so far as rigour is concerned go to the i farthest limit the act must prescribe ass or classes of cases which are to have reference to the persons by means of such two fold prescription the sphere for the application of the law will be confined only to a special type of cases it will be less vague less open to abuse and enable those who have to administer it to determine objec tively when a condition has arisen to justify the use of the power vested in them by the law it does not prescribe circumstances at all and though it purports to prescribe the class or classes it does so in a manner showing that the true meaning of the provision from which the < org > derived its power has not been grasped but i must point out that even if it be assumed that the view advanced by the learned attorney general is correct and it was within the competence of < org > to treat any of the categories mentioned in items and of lists i and iii as constitut", "ing a class and to include it without any qualification or change the impugned section cannot be saved on account of a two fold error the first error appears to me to be quite a serious one because though the constitution lays down two require ments and insists on the prescription of circumstances as well as class or classes it has been assumed in enacting section that prescription of one of them only will be enough there can in my opinion be no escape from the conclusion that section of the act by which a most impor tant protection or safeguard conferred on the subject by the constitution has been taken away is not a valid provision since it contravenes the very provision in the constitution under which the < org > derived its competence to enact it i will now briefly deal with article which makes it incumbent on the authority ordering preventive deten tion to communicate to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and to give him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order it must be remembered that this provision is intended to afford protection to and be a safeguard in favour of a detained person and it cannot be read as limiting any rights which he has under the law or any other provisions of the consti tution if article guarantees that before a person is deprived of his liberty he must be allowed an opportunity of establishing his innocence before an impartial tribunal that right still remains in point of fact there is no express exclusion of that right in the constitution and no prohibition against constituting an impartial tribunal on the other hand the right to make a representation which has been granted under the constitution must carry with it the right to the representation being properly considered by an impartial person or persons the constitution of an advisory board for the purpose of reporting whether a person should be detained for more than three months or not is a very different thing from constituting a board for the purpose of reporting whether a man should be detained for a single day in the view i take all that < org > could do under clause a of article was to dispense with an advisory board for the purpose contemplated in clause a of that article and not to dispense with the proper machinery by whichever name it may be called for the purpose of examining the merits of the case of a detained person it was argued that article is a code by itself and the whole law of preventive detention is to be found within its four corners it is said that it provides for notice an opportuni ty to the detenu to represent his case an advisory board which may deal with his case and for the", "maximum period beyond which a person cannot be detained the right to represent is given but it is left to the legislature to provide the machinery for dealing with the representation there is ample latitude still left to the < org > and if the < org > makes use of that latitude unreasonably article may enable the < org > to see whether it has transgressed the limits of reasonableness i will now proceed to deal with the act in the light of the conclusions i have arrived at so far as section of the act is concerned it was contended that it is most unreasonable because it throws a citizen at the mercy of certain authorities who may at their own will order his detention and into whose minds we cannot probe to see wheth er there is any foundation for the subjective satisfaction upon which their action is to rest the administrative authorities who have to discharge their responsibilities have to come to quick decisions and must necessarily be left to act on their own judgment under section of that code it is left to the discretion of the magistrate concerned to determine whether in his opinion there is sufficient ground for proceeding against any person who is likely to occasion a breach of the peace therefore i do not find anything wrong or unconstitutional in section of the act i do not also find anything radically wrong in section of the act which makes it incumbent on the authority con cerned to communicate to a detenu the grounds on which the order has been made and to afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa tion against the order section which provides that the advisory board shall make its report within ten weeks from the date of the detention order is in conformity with arti cle a of the constitution and the only comment which one can make is that < org > was not obliged to fix such a long period for the submission of a report and could have made it shorter in ordinary cases the real sections which appear to me to offend the constitution are sections and i also think that even if it be held that it technically complies with the requirements of article a < org > has acted unreasonably in exercising its discretionary power without applying its mind to essential matters and thus depriving the detenus of the safeguard of an advisory board which the constitution has provided in normal cases so far as section is con cerned all my colleagues have held it to be ultra vires and as i agree with the views expressed by them i do not wish to encumber my judgment by repeating in my own words what has been said so clearly and so well by them this writ", "will of course be without prejudice to any action which the authorities may have taken or may hereafter take against the petitioner under the penal law i have to add this qualification because there were allega tions of his being involved in some criminal cases but the actual facts were not clearly brought out before us we are aware that in america certain standards which do not conform to ordinary and normal law have been applied by the judges during the period of the war and sometimes they are compen dionsly referred to as being included in war power the two english cases to which i have referred also illustrate the same principle as will appear from two short extracts which i wish to reproduce in < name > < name > lord < name > observed as follows however precious the personal liberty of the subject may be there is something for which it may well be to some extent sacrificed by legal enactment namely national success in the war or escape from national plunder or enslavement it is difficult to say that there is not a good substratum of sound law in the celebrat ed dictum of lord < name > that even amidst the clash of arms the laws are not silent and that they speak the same lan guage in war as in peace there was also a provision in the act of that the secretary of < org > should report at least once in every month as to the action taken under the regulation including the number of persons detained under orders made thereunder i find that there is a provision in section of the act for the review of the cases of detenus after six months but this is quite different from examining the merits of the case granting then that private rights must often be subordinated to the public good is it not essen tial in a free community to strike a just balance in the matter that a person should be deprived of his personal liberty without a trial is a serious matter but the needs of society may demand it and the individual may often have to yield to those needs the petitioner had been under detention previously under orders passed by the said government under the madras main tenance of public order act but as the validity of that act and all other similar local public safety enact ments had been questioned in some of < org > in india after the new constitution came into force the par liament enacted a comprehensive measure called the preven tive detention act hereinafter referred to as the impugned act extending to the whole of india with a certain exception not material here the act came into force on th february and on the t", "##h february the government of madras in purported exercise of the powers conferred by the impugned act and in supersession of earlier orders directed the detention of the petitioner and the order was served on him on st march it is modelled on the first ten amendments of the american con stitution which declare the fundamental rights of the american citizen clause of the article on which the petitioner con tention is primarily founded reads as follows the state shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void as the constitutional inhibition against deprivation or abridgement relates only to the rights conferred by this part it is necessary first to ascertain the nature and extent of the right which according to the petitioner part iii has conferred on him and secondly to determine wheth er the right so ascertained has been taken away or abridged by the impugned act or by any of its provisions the first question turns on the proper interpretation of the relevant articles of the constitution and the second involves the consideration of the provisions of the impugned act in the first place the right to move freely throughout the territory of india referred to in article is of the very essence of personal liber ty and inasmuch as the detention authorised by the impugned act was not a reasonable restriction which < org > could validly impose on such right under clause of the article the impugned act is void alternatively the petitioner had a fundamental right under article not to be deprived of his personal liberty except according to procedure established by law and the impugned act by autho rising detention otherwise than in accordance with proper procedure took away that right and was therefore void but the question is does article in its setting in part iii of the constitution deal with the deprivation of per sonal liberty in the sense of incarceration sub clause of clause does not refer to freedom of movement simplic iter but guarantees the right to move freely throughout the territory of india sub clause similarly guaran tees the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of india reading these provisions together it is reasonably clear that they were designed primarily to emphasise the factual unity of the territory of india and to secure the right of a free citizen to move from one place in india to another and to reside and settle in any part of india unhampered by any barriers which nar row minded provincialism may seek to interpose the use of the word restrictions in the various sub clauses seems to imply in the context that the rights guaranteed by the article are", "still capable of being exercised and to exclude the idea of incarceration though the words restriction and deprivation are sometimes used as interchangeable terms as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to deprivation it was said that subclause would militate against this view as the enjoyment of the right to acquire hold and dispose of property does not depend upon the owner retaining his personal freedom in other words article guarantees to the citizens the enjoyment of certain civil liberties while they are free while articles secure to all persons citizens and non citizens certain constitutional guarantees in regard to punishment and prevention of crime different criteria are provided by which to measure legisla tive judgments in the two fields and a construction which would bring within article imprisonment in punishment of a crime committed or in prevention of a crime threatened would as it seems to me make a reductio ad absurdum of that provision if imprisonment were to be regarded as a restriction of the right mentioned in article it would equally be a restriction on the rights mentioned by the other subclauses of clause with the result that all penal laws providing for imprisonment as a mode of punish ment would have to run the gauntlet of clauses to before their validity could be accepted for instance the law which imprisons for theft would on that view fall to be justified under clause as a law sanctioning restric tion of freedom of speech and expression the learned judges construed article as covering cases of deprivation of personal liberty and held logically enough that inasmuch as the impugned act by authorising preventive detention infringed the right to freedom of speech and expression its validity should be judged by the reservations in clause and as it failed to stand that test it was unconstitutional and void he drew a dis tinction between the right conferred by sub clause and those conferred by the other sub clauses he urged refer ring to blackstone commentaries that personal liberty consisted in moving one person to whatever place one inclination might direct and that any law which de prived a person of such power of locomotion was a direct invasion of the right mentioned in sub clause whereas it inter fered only indirectly and consequentially with the rights mentioned in the other sub clauses there is no substance in the distinction suggested all the rights mentioned in clause are equally essential elements in the liberty of the individual in any civilised and democrat ic community and imprison ment operates as an extinction of all of them alike it cannot therefore be said that deprivation of personal liberty is an infringement of the right conferred by sub clause alone but not of the others the learned judges of < org > realised this and", "were perfectly logical in holding that the constitutional validity of a law providing for deprivation of personal liberty or imprisonment must be judged by the tests laid down not only in clause of article but also in the other clauses including clause though their major premise that deprivation of personal liberty was a restriction within the meaning of article is in my judgment erroneous there is no room here in my opinion for the application of the rule of pith and sub stance article as i have already indicated guarantees protection for the more important civil liberties of citizens who are in the enjoyment of their freedom while at the same time laying down the re strictions which the legislature may properly impose on the exercise of such rights and it has nothing to do with deprivation of personal liberty or imprisonment which is dealt with by the succeeding three articles there is also another consideration which points to the same conclusion < org > to whose report reference was freely made by both sides during the argument recommended that the word liber ty should be qualified by the insertion of the word person al before it for otherwise it might be construed very widely so as to include even the freedoms already dealt with in article now article connotation of the expression personal liberty it was used in article in a sense which excludes the freedoms dealt with in article that is to say personal liberty in the context of part iii of the constitution is something distinct from the freedom to move freely throughout the territory of india it was further submitted that article declared the substantive rights of personal liberty while article provided the procedural safeguard against their deprivation it is however to be ob served that article confers the rights therein specified only on the citizens of india while article extends the protection of life and personal liberty to all persons citizens and noncitizens alike thus the two articles do not operate in a conterminous field and this is one reason for rejecting the correlation suggested again if article is to be understood as providing only proce dural safeguards where is the substantive right to personal liberty of non citizens to be found in the constitution are they denied such right altogether if they are to have no right of personal liberty why is the proce dural safeguard in article exended to them and where is that most fundamental right of all the right to life provided for in the constitution the truth is that arti cle like its american prototype in the fifth and four teenth amendments of the constitution of the united states presents an example of the fusion of procedural and substan tive rights in the same provision and the first and essential step in a proce dure established by law for", "such deprivation must be a law made by a competent legislature authorising such deprivation this brings me to the consid eration of articles and to which was deroted the greater part of the debate at the < org > no person shall be deprived of his life or person al liberty except according to procedure established by law no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate nothing in clauses and shall apply a to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien or to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless a an advisory board consisting of persons who are or have been or are qualified to be appointed as judges of < org > has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi cient cause for such detention provided that nothing in this sub clause shall autho rise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by parliament under sub clause of clause or such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by < org > under sub clauses a and of clause when any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention the authority making the order shall as soon as may be commu nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order nothing in clause shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven tive detention without obtaining the opinion of < org > in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause the maximum period for which any person may in any class", "or classes of cases be detained under any law provid ing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by < org > in an inquiry under sub clause a of clause mr < name > urged that the word law in article should be understood not in the sense of an enactment but as signifying the immutable and universal principles of natural justice the jus naturale of the civil law and that the expression procedure established by law meant the same thing as that famous phrase due process of law in the american constitution in its procedural aspect numerous american decisions were cited to show that the phrase implied the basic requirements of an objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possi ble to conform notice to the party of the accusation against him a reasonable opportunity for him to estab lish his innocence and an impartial tribunal capable of giving an unbiased judgment mr < name > conceded that these requirements might have to be modified or adapted to suit the nature of the particular proceeding and the object it had in view as for instance in a case of preventive detention previous notice which might result in the person concerned going underground might be dispensed with learned counsel insisted that these requirements being the very core of the principles of natural justice which transcended all state made laws must be substantially complied with by any law governing the process of deprivation of life or personal liberty subject of course to any express provision in the constitution sanctioning their relaxation or dispensation in any case or class of cases there can be no doubt that the people of india have in exercise of their sovereign will as expressed in the pream ble adopted the democratic ideal which assures to the citizen the dignity of the individual and other cherished human values as a means to the full evolution and expression of his personality and in delegating to the legislature the executive and the judiciary their respective powers in the constitution reserved to themselves certain fundamental rights socalled i apprehend because they have been re tained by the people and made paramount to the delegated powers as in the american model < name > who played a prominent part in framing the first amendment of the ameri can constitution pointing out the distinction due to historical reasons between the american and the british ways of securing the great and essential rights of the people observed here they are secured not by laws para mount to prerogative but by constitutions paramount to laws report on the virginia resolutions quoted in < name > minnesota procedure established by law must be taken to refer to a procedure which has a statutory origin for no procedure is known or can be said to have", "been established by such vague and uncertain concepts as the immutable and universal principles of natural justice no doubt the american judges have adopted the other connotation in their interpretation of the due process clause in the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the ameri can constitution nor shall any person be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law and when that power was threatened with prostration by the excesses of due process the equally vague and expansive doctrine of police power i the power of < org > to regulate private rights in public interest was evolved to counteract such excesses a century after the phrase had been the subject of judicial interpretation one learned judge observed in that it was incapable of precise definition and that its intent and application could only be ascer tained by the gradual process of inclusion and exclusion < name > new orleans and as recently as another judge referred to the difficulty of giving defi niteness to the vague contours of due process and of spinning judgment upon < org > action out of that gossamer concept < name > < org > of ohio article stands for the jus naturale of the civil law and that the phrase according to procedure established by law is equivalent to due process of law in its procedural aspect for that would have the effect of introducing into our constitution those subtle and elusive criteria implied in that phrase which it was the deliberate purpose of the framers of our constitution to avoid on the other hand the interpretation suggested by the attorney general on behalf of the intervener that the ex pression means nothing more than procedure prescribed by any law made by a competent legislature is hardly more accept able established according to him means prescribed and if < org > or the < org > enacted a proce dure however novel and ineffective for affording the ac cused person a fair opportunity of defending himself it would be sufficient for depriving a person of his life or personal liberty learned counsel drew attention to the speeches made by several members of the < org > on the floor of the < org > for explaining as he put it the his torical background a speech made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker but it could not reflect the inarticulate mental processes lying behind the majority vote which carried the bill the < org > could only search for the objec tive intent of the legislature primarily in the words used in the enactment aided by such historical material as reports of statutory committees", "preambles etc i attach no importance therefore to the speeches made by some of the members of the constituent < org > in the course of the debate on article now article the main difficulty i feel in accepting the construction suggested by the attorney general is that it completely stultifies article and indeed the very conception of a fundamental right it is no sound answer to say that if article conferred no right immune from legisla tive invasion there would be no question of contravening article it is said that article affords no protection against competent legislative action in the field of substantive criminal law for there is no provision for judicial review on the ground of reasonable ness or otherwise of such laws as in the case of the rights enumerated in article it was argued that law in article which provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law must mean enacted law and that if a person property could be taken away by legislative action his right to life and personal liberty need not enjoy any greater immunity clause of article provides for payment of compensation and that right is justiciable except in the two cases mentioned in clauses and which are of a tran sitory character much reliance was placed on the irish case the king the military governor of hare park camp where the court held that the term law in article of the irish constitu tion of which provides that the liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law meant a law enacted by the < org > and that therefore the public safety act of did not contravene the constitution the court followed the king halliday where < org > by a majority held that the defence of the realm consolidation act and the regulations framed thereunder did not infringe upon the habeas corpus acts and the magna carta for the simple reason that the act and the orders become part of the law of the land there is no substance in the suggestion as pointed out in < name > gov ernment of nigeria officer administering the execu tive could only act in pursuance of the powers given by law and no constitutional protection against such action is really needed in accordance with british jurisprudence said lord < name > in the case cited above no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a british subject except on the condition that he can support the legality of his action before < org > after giving the matter my most careful and anxious consideration i have come to the conclusion that there are only two possible solutions of the problem certain basic principles emerge as", "the constant factors common to all those proce dures and they form the core of the procedure established by law suppose that article was not there and < org > passed an act as a temporary measure taking away in certain cases the right of an accused person to be defended by a legal practitioner according to the petition er learned counsel the act would be void as being contrary to the immutable principles of natural justice embodied in article whereas on the construction contended for by the attorney general the act would be perfectly valid while on the view i have indicated above the act would be bad but if the denial of such right of defence is made a normal feature of the ordinary law of criminal procedure by abro gating section of the code article would be powerless to protect against such legislative action but in a free democratic republic such a drastic change in the normal law of procedure though theoretically possi ble would be difficult to bring about and that practical difficulty will be the measure of the protection afforded by article if it was really the intention of the framers of the constitution to exclude the application of article to cases of preventive detention nothing would have been easier than to add a reference to article in clause of article which provides that clauses and of the latter shall not apply to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention nor is there anything in the language of clauses to of article leading necessarily to the inference that article is inapplicable to preventive detention these clauses deal only with certain aspects of preventive deten tion such as the duration of such detention the constitu tion of an advisory board for reviewing the order of deten tion in certain cases the communication of the grounds of detention to the person detained and the provision of an opportunity to him of making a representation against the order the outstanding fact to be borne in mind in this connection is that preventive detention has been given a constitutional status in the first place as already stated clause of article excludes a person detained under any law providing for preventive detention from the benefit of the safeguards provided in clauses and no doubt clause of the same article makes some amends for the deprivation of these safeguards in that it provides for the communication to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and for an opportunity being afforded to him of making a representation against the order but the important right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice is gone of the four essentials of the due process on which mr < name > insisted which also form part of the ordinary and established procedure under the criminal", "procedure code though i cannot agree that they are immutable and beyond legislative change the requirements of notice and an opportunity to establish his innocence must as already stated be taken to have been provided for by clause of article as for an ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possible to conform article makes no specific provision in cases of preventive detention and if such a safeguard can be said to be implicit in the procedure established by law in the sense explained above in preventive detention cases it could no doubt be invoked this mr < name > submitted was left unprovided for by article the advisory board referred to in clause a being according to him intended to deal solely with the question of duration of the detention that is to say whether or not there was sufficient cause for detaining the person concerned for more than three months and not with judging whether the person detained was innocent a tribunal which could give an unbiassed judg ment on that issue was an essential part of the protection afforded by article in whichever way it may be interpret ed and reference was made in this connection to the preven tive provisions of the criminal procedure code ch is that view correct it was argued that the words sufficient cause for such detention in sub clause a of clause had reference to the detention beyond three months mentioned in clause and that this view was supported by the language of sub clause a of clause whereby < org > is authorised to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without the opinion of an advisory board in other words learned counsel submitted the combined effect of clauses and was that no person could be detained for a period over three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board that there was sufficient cause for detention for the longer period except in cases where < org > passed a law autho rising detention for such period even without the opinion of an advisory board the fact that the advisory board is required to make its report before the expiry of three months and so could submit it only a day or two earlier cannot legitimately lead to an inference that the board was solely concerned with the issue whether or not the detention should continue beyond that period before any such tribunal could send in its report a reasonable time must elapse as the grounds have to be communicated to the person detained he has to make his representation to the detaining authority which has got to be placed before the board through the appropriate departmental channel each of these steps may in the course of official routine take some time and three months period", "might well have been thought a reasonable period to allow before the board could be required to submit its report assuming however that the words such detention had reference to the period of detention there is no apparent reason for confining the enquiry by the advisory board to the sole issue of duration beyond three months without reference to the question as to whether the detention was justified or not indeed if is difficult to conceive how a tribunal could fairly judge whether a person should be detained for more than three months without at the same time considering whether there was sufficient cause for the detention at all i am of opinion that the advisory board referred to in clause is the machinery devised by the constitution for reviewing orders for preventive detention in certain cases on a consideration of the representations made by the persons detained this is the view on which < org > has proceeded in enacting the impugned act as will be seen from sections and thereof and i think it is the correct view mr < name > however objected that on this view a law could authorise preventive detention for three months with out providing for review by any tribunal and for even longer periods if < org > passed an act such as is con templated in sub clause a of clause in the first place it was contended that section which empowers < org > or < org > to detain any person if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to among other things the security of the < org > or the maintenance of public order cannot be said to comply with the procedure established by law as the section prescribes no objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it will be possible to conform but leaves it to the will and pleasure of the government concerned to make an order of detention tim argument proceeds on the assumption that the procedure established by law is equivalent to the due process of law as tim very term implies the detention in such cases is effected with a view to prevent the person concerned from acting prejudi cially to certain objects which the legislation providing for such detention has in view having been laid on the executive government it must naturally be left to that government to exercise the power of preventive detention whenever they think the occa sion demands it any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of < org > for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention namely where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from", "acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of india relations of india with for eign powers or the security of india or the security of a state of the maintenance of public order the case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub section apply shall within a period of six months from the date of his detention be reviewed where the order was made by < org > or a state government by such govern ment and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub section of section by < org > to which such officer is subordinate in consultation with a person who is or has been or is qualified to be appointed as a judge of < org > nominated in that behalf by < org > or < org > as the case may be it was urged that this did not comply with the require ments of clause of article as it merely repeated the matters or legislative topics mentioned in entry of list i and entry of list iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution what < org > has to do under clause of article is to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board it was said that clause a provided for ordinary cases of preventive detention where such detention could not continue beyond three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board whereas clause a made provision for special cases of detention for more than three months with out the safeguard of the advisory board opinion for aggravated forms of prejudicial conduct it was therefore necessary for < org > to indicate to the detaining authority for its guidance the more aggravated forms of prejudicial activity and mere mention of the subjects in respect of which < org > is authorised under the legislative lists to make laws in respect of preventive detention could hardly afford any guidance to such authority and should not be regarded as sufficient compliance with the requirements of clause there is a two fold fallacy in this argument reading clauses and together it is reasonably clear that preventive detention could last longer in two cases where the opinion of an advisory board is obtained subject however to a prescribed period sub clause a of clause and where a person is detained under a law made by < org > under sub clauses a and of clause sub clause of clause secondly the argument loses sight of the fact that clause deals with preventive detention which is a purely precautionary measure which must necessarily proceed in all cases to some extent on suspicion or anticipation as distinct from proof per lord < name > in <", "name > < name > how could the insertion in section of a long series of categories of aggravated forms of prejudicial activities or the enumeration of the various circumstances in which such activities are likely to be indulged in be of any assist ance to the detaining authority in determining whether the person concerned should be detained for three months or for a longer period all that would be necessary and suffi cient for him to know for coming to a decision on the point is that the person is a member of such an organisation and will probably engage in subversive activities prejudicial to the security of the < org > or the maintenance of public order or in other words he belongs to class in section reference was made in this connection to rule of the defence of india rules framed under the defence of india act where prejudicial act is defined by enumeration in lists i and iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution six topics are mentioned in respect of which < org > could make laws providing for preventive detention and section of the impugned act mentions five of them as being the classes of cases or the circumstances in which longer detention is authorised a class can well be designated with refer ence to the end which one desires to secure and the matters referred to as classes a and of sub section of section being clearly the objects which < org > desired to secure by enacting the section it seems to me that the classification with refer ence to such general aims does not contravene article there is no substance in this objection as i read article it means that < org > may prescribe either the circumstances or the classes of cases or both and in enacting section < org > evidently regarded the matters mentioned in clause a and of sub section as sufficiently indic ative both of the circumstances under which and the classes in which a person could be detained for the longer period to say for instance that persons who are likely to act prejudicially to the defence of india may be detained beyond three months is at once to prescribe a class of persons in which and the circumstances under which a person may be detained for the longer period the circumstances which would justify precautionary deten tion beyond three months without recourse to an advisory board must be far too numerous for anything approaching an exhaustive enumeration and it can in my judgment be no objection to the validity of section that no circum stances are mentioned apart from the matters referred to in clauses a and of sub section lastly mr < name > turned his attack on section which prohibits the disclosure of the grounds of", "detention communicated to the person detained and of the representa tion made by him against the order of detention and debars the < org > from allowing such disclosure to be made except for purposes of a prosecution punishable under sub section which makes it an offence for any person to disclose or publish such grounds or representation without the previous authorisation of < org > or < org > as the case may be the petitioner com plains that this provision nullifies in effect the rights conferred upon him under clause of article which entitles him to have the grounds of his detention communi cated to him and to make a representation against the order if the grounds are too vague to enable him to make any such representation or if they are altogether irrelevant to the object of his detention or are such as to show that his detention is not bona fide he has the further right of moving this < org > and this remedy is also guaranteed to him under article there is great force in this contention the argument overlooks that it was recognised in the decision referred to above that it would be open to the < org > to examine the grounds of detention in order to see whether they were relevant to the object which the legislature had an examina tion of the grounds for these purposes is made impossible by section and the protection afforded by article and article is thereby rendered nugatory it follows that section contravenes the provisions of article and article in so far as it prohibits the person detained from disclosing to the < org > the grounds of his detention communicated to him by the detaining authority or the repre sentation made by him against the order of detention and prevents the < org > from examining them for the purposes aforesaid and to that extent it must be held under article to be void < name > of india having solemnly resolved to constitute india into a sovereign democratic republic on the th day of november gave to themselves a constitution which came into force on the th january < name > the petitioner who was already under the custody of the superintendent central jail cuddalore was served with an order of detention under section of the preventive detention act act iv of on the th february it was said in the order that the governor of madras was satisfied that it was necessary to make the order with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the state and the maintenance of public order on th march a petition was presented to this < org > under article of the constitution praying for the issue of a writ of", "habeas corpus directing the state of madras to produce him before the < org > and to set him at liberty the decision of the question whether act iv of takes away or abridges the rights conferred by part iii of the constitution depends on a consideration of two points in what measure has the constitution secured person al liberty to a citizen of india and it will cease to have effect on st april it empowers < org > and the < org > governments to make an order directing a person to be detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of india the relations of india with foreign powers or the security of india it also gives power to detain a person who acts in any manner prejudicial to the security of the < org > or the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community it came into force on th february and was enacted by virtue of the powers conferred on < org > by article clause of part iii of the constitution read with the entries in the th schedule it is quite obvious that the < org > cannot declare a statute unconstitutional and void simply on the ground of unjust and oppressive provi sions or because it is supposed to violate natural social or political rights of citizens unless it it can be shown that such injustice is prohibited or such rights are guaranteed or protected by the constitution it is difficult on any general principles to limit the omnipo tence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial inter position except in so far as the express words of a written constitution give that authority it says that the < org > shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void article in this part provides no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate nothing in clauses and shall apply a to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien or to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for", "preventive detention no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless a < org > consisting of persons who are or have been or are qualified to be appointed as judges of < org > has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi cient cause for such detention provided that nothing in this sub clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period pre scribed by any law made by < org > under sub clause of clause or such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by <
